you
well I had what I thought was a pretty
good talk prepared but there's only one
problem the notes are in my hotel room I
just discovered so I'll have to wing it
and that means I can't take
responsibility for quotes and exact
references but if you want them I can
provide them from memory as well there
are the world is of course always
changing there are however some quite
significant continuities it's worth
paying attention to them one was as a
principal that was expressed a couple
hundred years ago by well-known figure
named Adam Smith who talked about
governance and how it works
he pointed out that the people who own
the society those he called the Masters
of mankind will also be the ones who set
policy and they will pursue what he
called their vile Maxim all for
ourselves nothing for anyone else if
that sounds familiar it is he was of
course particularly interested in
England and in England he said the
Masters of mankind are the merchants and
manufacturers and they devise policy
they're the principal architects of
policy and they ensure that their own
interests are very well served however
Grievous the impact on others including
the people of England but particularly
what concerned him properly was the
victims of their savage injustice
elsewhere of India was his prime concern
there are modern and sophisticated
versions of Smith's thesis adapted to
our own society the the best one I know
the most is by a very good very fine
political
economist Thomas Ferguson it's what he
calls his investment theory of politics
it interprets elections as occasions on
which the groups of investors coalesce
the to invest to control the state and
as he chose over the past century that's
quite a good predictor of what policy is
going to be just looking at the
coalitions of investors who became the
principal architects of policy today
it's not merchants and manufacturers
it's multinational corporations and
financial institutions but the
principles remain about the same in fact
we saw a good example of it in the last
election 2008 the Obama's victory in
2008 was primarily due to a big flow of
capital that poured in especially toward
the end from financial institutions who
preferred him to McCain and that carried
him over the edge and of course they
expected to be rewarded and they were
immediately the the country was in the
midst of a big financial crisis of the
main task was to deal with it
Obama picked a an economic team to deal
with the crisis the team was selected
entirely almost entirely from the people
who were responsible for the crisis that
excluded quite prestigious figures and
Nobel laureates and others who had been
very critical of what they had done and
not particularly surprisingly they
produced a policy which rewarded the the
those who were responsible for the
crisis almost with often with criminal
acts and left everyone else in the dust
enacted it was an interesting review of
this a couple of days ago which maybe
you saw by Neil Barofsky
who was the special investigator for the
the bailout and he points out that the
the legislation behind the bailout was
actually a compromise the banks who were
responsible for the crisis would be
bailed out by the taxpayer of course in
violation of capitalist principles but
that doesn't bother anyone the and but
the victims people who were their
victims would get some kind of
compensation well he pointed out now
it's couple years later we can see what
happens
1/2 the compromise was carried out the
implementation responded to the people
who have a voice
the Masters of mankind and they were
billed out royally there know the
biggest ones are richer and bigger than
before poised to set off the next crisis
which is almost inevitable I mean while
the other half of the bargain was
eliminated foreclosures continue to
mount they're going even higher on those
notes back in my hotel room I have some
of the numbers but they're pretty pretty
telling and that's the way democratic
politics works in a society with high
concentration of wealth and power this
concentration is not a law of nature
it's not due to economic principles or
history or whatever it's due to
decisions specific decisions that's it
the country's always of course been
unequal but peasant I'm sure all of you
know it's now reached the level of
inequality that's breaking all records
and that's even that's misleading
because the actual primary cause of the
inequality is in such a small sector of
the population that it isn't even picked
up by census figures so you have to do
more careful economic analysis to figure
out what it is it's basically the top
one-tenth of 1% of the population which
has become spectacularly
wealthy in recent years now that's the
rest is bad enough but that's what's
tilting the balance kind of off the
scale
and as in a chord with Smith's maxim
they are the greater their economic
power the greater their political power
and they use it to accelerate the
vicious cycle that has been set off it
was set off in its current form back in
the early 1970s that's the major change
in world affairs since the Second World
War there had been a there was an
economic system international economic
system established by the victors in the
war the United States and Britain the
John Maynard Keynes for Britain Harry
Dexter white for the United States of
called Bretton Woods system which laid
the basis for several decades of
unparalleled growth over a long period
it's the economists sometimes call at
the Golden Age of state capital they
call capitalism state capitalism big
state component and no no financial
crises New Deal
the legendary apparatus was still in
place the growth period was also
egalitarian the lowest quintile did
about as well as the highest quintile
and that continued up until the
seventies the early 1970s there was a
significant shift the that compact the
Bretton Woods system was based on
regulation of Finance regulation of
capital so currencies were said pretty
well fixed a small band had snow
speculation on currencies governments
had the right to control capital flows
all of that was dismantled in the early
1970s and had a very big effect one in
need over the world one in the United
States the effect was that in fact
elsewhere a very sharp increase in
financial in essential in the growth of
financial institutions back at that time
they were essentially doing what they're
supposed to do in a state capitalist
economy like a bank is supposed to take
unused capital like your bank account
and transmit it to some productive
purpose and pretty much that's what
banks were doing now it's totally
different starting in the early 70s they
move towards more and more exotic
financial manipulations which have
nothing to do with a productive economy
an effect probably Harmon but do make
plenty of money that withdraws capital
from productive purposes but it reached
such a point that right before the last
crash the financial institutions
literally you had about 40 percent of
corporate profits by now after the crash
now they're picking up again and
prisoners will be the same or more as I
say they have no known social function
other than making money for people who
play around with investments and their
short-term capital flows and so on in a
and meanwhile and that did lead that set
off this vicious cycle increasing
concentration of capital of the top
one-tenth of one percent means CEOs
hedge fund managers people like that
with it concentration of political power
that concentration of political power is
then used to escalate the cycle by all
sorts of legislative means for example
fiscal politics policy a tax policy is
increasingly designed to benefit the
super-rich and
harm everyone else that's been going on
for years as no economic purpose but it
does serve the interests of the Masters
of mankind sometimes it's done pretty
subtly sometimes so you don't notice it
so the Bush tax cuts which are now
heavily burdening the economy are were
designed so that people wouldn't notice
what's happening so the first year the
you may recall the first year the tax
cuts
everybody got a small rebate you know a
couple hundred dollars in the mails they
feel good about it
and it wasn't too unbalanced the first
year somewhat but not too much but it
was designed so that by the end after at
the end of the ten year period over half
that went to the top 1% of the
population but by then you know kind of
hard to figure out so people just
remember that first year it's called the
sunset policy you design policy so that
first it won't be noticeable but by the
time the Sun sets it'll do the right
thing go into the pockets of the very
rich and that those same policies
continue to be pursued in other domains
actually we've just seen it in the
lame-duck session of Congress but since
last November
Obama was greatly praised for his
statesmanship and bipartisanship and
passing of making important legislation
go through you know no bickering in
Congress and that's true the main
legislative achievement was to increase
but to cut taxes for the super-rich and
I mean super-rich like I'm pretty
well-off but I was below the cutoff
point the the very rich you know make
sure that they get a big tax cut meaning
while everybody's pounding the table
about the need to reduce the deficit it
was a pretty tricky PR campaign to carry
that off but it was done at the same
time with less notice there was a tax
increase
that for federal workers that wasn't
called a tax increase because that
doesn't sound nice it was called a
freeze unpaid but it takes about 30
seconds for you to figure out that a
freeze on pay for public sector workers
is a tax increase for the public sector
workers and if it extends over a couple
of years it's a significant tax increase
because of the effect of inflation you
know population growth and so on so a
significant tax increase for public
sector workers big tax decrease for the
super wealthy huge impact on the deficit
trillions of dollars and it was somehow
carried off actually there was a another
tricky measure that was introduced there
was a payroll decrease for Social
Security so you know people are paying
Social Security got a slight rebate and
that it's not that's a good idea in
itself what's needed today is the
deficit is the secondary problem what's
needed is a stimulus of demand to
increase growth you not supposed to talk
about that that's outside the spectrum
but pretty obviously true so a payroll
decrease for in Social Security makes
good sense but there was a it's a Trojan
horse take a look at the way it was
designed it was designed to run out just
before the 2012 election both parties
understand that with the 2012 election
coming on
nobody's gonna kind of call for a tax
increase okay that's poison so therefore
it's permanent permanent decline in
funding for Social Security it means
that it really will have a problem now
it has no problem that's all faker
that's very good shape for decades to
come and to be tweaked to go on forever
but if it is defunded it'll have a
problem now there's a standard way of
privatizing something like when Margaret
Thatcher wanted to privatize the British
Rail road's
the technique was defund them and then
when they don't work people get angry
they say let's do something so you hand
it over to private enterprise which
totally ruins them and then the state
has to come back in because and try to
reconstruct it somehow it's known as
privatization the and that's exactly
what's happening with Social Security
it's in good shape now when you read in
the newspapers as you do that the big
problem of the deficit is entitlements
and Social Security you Medicare or
Medicaid Social Security is a zero
problem oh I think it doesn't add
anything to the deficit because people
pay for it and for another thing it's in
pretty good shape
certainly well very the last of the
famous baby boomers will be gone before
there's any problem in it that's why
there's a big payroll tax increase
thirty years ago to ensure that but if
it's defunded it'll be a problem then
they'll be pressured to privatize it
that's a huge bonanza for the financial
institutions it'll put trillions of
dollars into their hands which they can
then use to make a ton of money with
risky investments which are therefore
very profitable and when it tanks as it
will win in the economy tanks you just
there's a technique you pick up your
copies of Milton Friedman and Hayek and
nine rand and you run through the nine a
state that you've nurtured and you make
sure that they bail you out that's
really existing capitalism and it means
that the scam can go on the name for it
is too big to fail and as one
commentator put it also too big to jail
because a lot of this is pure current
purely criminal borovsky points out that
credit agencies are now taking into
account and assigning rankings on the
assumption that the system is going to
crash and that the taxpayer will come in
and bail them out that's
what we call capitalism market
principles for the poor but not for me
please that's traditional no come back
to it in a minute but that's what's
being done with Social Security it's
also being done with the public
education it's being defunded so it
doesn't work that when it doesn't work
people get angry and then they want to
do something about it and then the
propaganda starts pouring in about
teachers with their huge pensions and so
on and so forth and you know some people
get angry at then teachers not at
goldman sachs which just announced
quietly seventeen and a half billion
dollars of consent of compensation for
the executives who created the crisis
special 12 and a half million dollar
bonus for the CEO and tripling of his
base salary you don't get angry at them
what you do is get angry at the teachers
you know the firefighters and all these
people are milking us and so on and a
standard technique of population control
and if you defend the system and people
want to privatize it it'll sir later get
privatized but it doesn't work really
well it'll be worse but it's fine for
the rich now they'll be taken care of
there they don't care much if you have
public education actually you might ask
why is there such an intense effort and
it's really fanatic if you look at it to
destroy social security and public
education they work pretty well no
Social Security has like a tiny fraction
of the administrative costs of
privatized systems and so basically none
all the money comes right back to the
people who paid to taxes and it's you
know it's of no value to rich people
they're like Pete Peters and the multi
billionaire is pressing the campaign he
points out constantly look I don't care
about it which is quite true you
wouldn't notice it it's not even around
but a lot of people live on it
especially after they've lost all their
assets there's just been a loss of eight
trillion dollars of capital that people
mistakenly put into the housing the
economists in the Federal Reserve were
for ideological reasons I'll come back
to it that didn't notice that there's a
huge housing bubble had nothing to do
with any economic fundamentals
it was completely dissociated from
rental from rents which it should be
connected to and it was totally off the
chart of a hundred years of records of
how housing pretty much correlated with
economic growth shut up it wasn't
noticed because of a religious doctrine
that's a religious doctrine called the
efficient market hypothesis that's what
the Joseph Stiglitz
fifteen years ago Nobel laureate called
the religion that markets know best and
if you're a firm believer in the
religion it'll take care of itself so
you want to notice it and when it
crashes you say I'm sorry of focus but
now it's up to the tip taxpayer to bail
you out government surance policy and
the game goes on gets worse next time in
the one of the parts of the vicious
cycle that's underway is the change in
other legislation so starting from the
70s primarily the Reagan years and on it
goes right through Clinton and of course
the regulatory apparatus was dismantled
and you know the barrier New Deal
barrier between commercial and
investment banks was broken that's when
the financial crisis began
there weren't any in the 50s in the 60s
when the New Deal system was in place
but they started under Reagan Reagan
left office with
the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression savings and loan the
country was a little less in the grip of
this fanaticism then so there were many
their convictions felony convictions for
those criminal acts and I think about a
thousand and that of course brought up
lots of information but not this time
this time the guys who carry out the
crimes are do it with impunity they're
too big to fail and they're too big to
jail so you don't investigate again this
is all policy there were other policy
decisions that aren't too visible like
changing the rules on corporate
government which essentially permit the
CEOs to pick the boards that set their
salaries comfort or to give you stock
options or something else that isn't
noticeable well all of these things
mount up they're designed to extend the
vicious cycle and it's exactly what they
do and we now have a situation there
something else that's happening too I
should several things I might as well
add those
meanwhile in relation to this to the
financialization of the economy there's
a the rate of profit in manufacturing
was in fact declining so you make more
money by financial manipulations than by
producing and it became increasingly
easy to set to offshore production now
that's what's called neoliberalism what
it is is it's sometimes called free
trade as nothing whatsoever to do with
free trade it's a system which is highly
protectionist for the powerful so huge
grants for you look at the World Trade
Organization rules guarantees for
monopoly pricing rights for publicly
funded into institutions like the
pharmaceutical institutions protection
for professionals no competition for
them but you said working people in
competition with one another all over
the world
as obvious effect it means that
worldwide in fact there's a decrease in
the share of income by working people
strikingly true in the United States
during the period of this vast increase
in wealth for tiny sector wages real
incomes for majority the population of
stagnated people get by with higher
working hours in fact by now higher than
Europe even Japan debt which can't go on
forever an asset inflation that is the
hope that your investment and things
like your home will carry you over
except that that's all paper money ins
it's rammed down people's throats with
the cheating delusions it's like nothing
new about this since this is this is a
1920s all over again I mean my father
for example a poor immigrant that was
deluded into buying property in Florida
that was big real estate boom it ended
up being somewhere at the Atlantic Ocean
that's not much different from the
subprime mortgage scams that are going
on today but the those are responsible
do it with impunity under the real laws
of capitalism and we're being set up for
the next and even worse crisis the major
banks investment firms are Richard
before they're sitting on tons of cash
at work with profits are sky-high
there's a problem in the economy of
limited demand there is an
you know people are too poor to purchase
there's no consumer demand not much
investment there's an answer to that the
government can increase demand
stimulated that's how we got out of the
Great Depression
that's how other countries to get out of
depressions we've done it too but that's
not what the Masters of mankind want
they want a focus on the deficit and the
debt one of the disadvantages of not
having notes as I got off track I was
going to ask the question why so let me
go back to that why if this is
disjointed you know blame it on my notes
up here the it was better organized than
the original but why the desperate
effort that destroy Social Security and
public education it can't be because
they're not working I mean they both
work extremely well we had a great
public education system here you know
from the school's up to higher education
all being dismantled so I don't know
what the story is here but in a majority
of the states in the country a tuition
that now pays more of the cost of
universities state universities than the
state does in California which is you
know had the greatest public education
system in the world next year for the
first time tuition is going to be more
than half the funding tuition is going
sky-high
it's like private universities and
probably the main California
universities Berkeley and UCLA probably
they'll be privatized they're almost
privatized already with the skeleton and
so on and the rest of the system will
decline for the rich it's fine it
doesn't affect them kids are going to go
to private universities anyway for the
state's economy it's going to be a
serious danger the economy relies on a
and has grown thanks to an educated
population that brings up another fact
I'll put it off to the side for a moment
and hope to remember to come back to it
so reminding
I don't there's in the current stage of
capitalism the long-term doesn't matter
that's a change from the past what
matters is what happens tomorrow
that's your what shows up in the next
quarter which also determines your
salary and so on if you're a CEO that or
if you fund manager or whatever so the
future doesn't matter the state of the
country doesn't matter and that's what
we see happening well why they attack on
public education from kindergarten on up
why they attack on Social Security it
can't be because of their inefficiency
in fact they work very well it has to be
something else
and I think if you think about it you
can see what it is Social Security and
public education are based on an
extremely dangerous principle namely
that you care about other people so for
example I don't happen to have kids in
school anymore
but if you believe in public education
I'm supposed to pay my taxes so that the
kid across the street can go to school
that's called solidarity mutual support
sympathy and so on
same with Social Security like it really
doesn't matter much to me I get it but
doesn't matter much got a big pension
but I'm supposed to the principle of
Social Security is that I care if
disabled widow across town doesn't have
enough food to eat if you believe in the
vile Maxim of the masters of mankind all
for ourselves nothing for anyone else
then it's her problem you know she made
her bed her husband made a bad
investment or something other her
problems you can start no reason why I
should send give a few pennies to which
I'm gonna notice to make sure that she's
okay so there's a principle principle of
care and concern for others it's
completely inconsistent with the viola
maxim and therefore it has to be
destroyed and any institution that
relies on it has to be destroyed we see
that happening all over the place it's a
major cultural phenomenon of trying to
destroy the the most elementary human
feelings and they are elementary but to
see how elementary they are it's
worthwhile going back to the early days
of the Industrial Revolution say mid
19th century eastern Massachusetts when
the Industrial Revolution took off
there was a very Free Press the freest
in the history of the country there was
hundreds of newspapers written by
communities ethnic communities workers
and the factories others expressing
their views about the world and their
interpretation of the world a lot of
dedication to it a lot of the papers
were in the factories the press was run
by Miss a Irish artisans from Boston
they're young women from the farms were
called factory girls and they make very
interesting reading they express the way
people felt about the early stages of
industrialization what they felt was
that their culture and their humanity
who was being destroyed by the process
of industrialization which was forcing
them into a mold in which they're
basically slaves so workers in the mid
nineteenth century didn't see much
difference between a chattel slavery and
wage labor in fact the only difference
they saw was that one of them's
temporary so you can get out of it
that was the slogan under which northern
workers went to war in the Civil War in
fact it was such a popular idea that
there was a was one of the main slogans
of the Republican Party weight wage
labor is same basically the same as
slavery
they also bitterly opposed what they
called this is 1850 what they called the
new spirit of the age they gained wealth
forgetting all but self okay that was
the new spirit of the age and 1850 being
rammed down their throats
still being rammed down people's throats
major effort because it's so totally
inhuman that it's hard for people to
accept it you know but with enough
beating it into your heads and maybe
it'll take off that's the hope at least
that was the new spirit of the age then
it was the vile Maxim that Smith wrote
about and it's the doctrine that's being
implemented right now right now it's
called the serious and courageous that
when Congress gets a proposal to cut
back food stamps on which 20% of the
population relies and to cut Social
Services for the general population but
also to cut taxes for the very rich
that's serious and courageous we're told
in the newspapers it's a basic assault
on the fundamental principles of any
civilized society and it's the agenda
that's being considered and then part
implemented by both parties incidentally
through varying degrees what about the
famous deficit suppose that we suspend
disbelief and say it's really a problem
I mean of course it's a problem in the
long term but very serious questions
whether it's an immediate problem but
let's say it is how do you get rid of it
well there's some pretty straightforward
ways just take a look at what causes a
deficit that sounds simple about half
the deficit comes from military spending
the US military spending is off the
chart yeah it's about the same as the
rest of the world combined
that's not for security in fact that
harms are secured but it's for other
reasons but you know that's one place
where you can cut away at the deficit
the other where's the other half come
from it comes from our dysfunctional
health care system it's the worst health
care system in the world it's near
national scandal
it's about twice the per capita costs of
comparable countries generally poor
outcomes by standards of rich countries
even poor ones and there's a reason for
it it's the only system that's
privatized and basically unregulated
it's it's so crazy that the United
States I think the only country in the
world where the government is barred by
law from negotiating drug prices select
the Pentagon can negotiate prices for
paper clips but the government can't
negotiate drug prices with a single
exception the Veterans Administration
and their drug prices are a fraction of
what most people pay and the fraction
and the same is true in other countries
so that in fact if you take a look at
the costs of the massively inefficient
privatized health care system what you
discover is that give you the sources if
you like but if we had the same kind of
system as other industrial countries not
exactly a utopian ideal we would have no
deficit in fact we'd have a surplus but
you can't touch that because that goes
after the insurance companies and the
financial institutions that's
untouchable there are the Masters of
mankind so that's not discussed which
means that the talk of the deficit is a
total farce from beginning to end even
if you accept that it's significant but
it makes sense in terms of Adam Smith's
principles there's all this correlates
with a lot of other phenomenon that are
worth thinking about so for example
they've been a lot of studies of the
relation between Senate say Senate votes
and popular opinion it turns out that
there's a correlation for the top for
the richest the top for the richest part
of the population is pretty good
correlation between Senate votes and
preferences
for the middle of the population there's
no correlation for the bottom third of
the population there's a negative
correlation that is Senate votes are the
opposite of what people want
there's many studies of the relation
between public policy and public
preferences is a very sharp disconnect
and both domestic and international
policy well you know that's in accord
with Smith's truism and you might ask
whether that's consistent with the
thinking of the founding fathers that's
actually an interesting question fact it
turns out that it is so if you read say
the records of the Constitutional
Convention James Madison into the
mainland framer explains to the
convention that and that the country has
to be set up so that power will be in
the hands of what he called the wealth
of the nation the more responsible set
of men that those who have respect for
property owners and their rights and who
understand that a major goal of policy
must be to protect the minority of the
opulent against the majority and for
that reason the system was set up the
way it is power was primarily in the
hands of the Senate senator of course
was not elected wasn't elected till long
after and as Madison put it the Senate
will be the wealth of the nation and
they'll carry out policies in the
interests of the nation the house which
is much a responsive to the population
had very little power the executive in
those days was an executive and
administrator not an emperor that's
changed over the years so that was the
basic structure of the country but in
Madison's defense you have to recognize
that he was pre-capitalist he did not
understand the capitalist system for him
the senators the wealth of the nation
were like the
ethical Romans of the fantasies at the
time they were benevolent aristocrats
and gentlemen who would have the
interests of the country at heart
Adam Smith had a somewhat sharper eye
and that isn't pretty soon soy 2 by 1792
he was already deploring the effects of
the democratic experiment he said its
power is being taken by the stock
jobbers you know the stock market of his
day who were the tools and tyrants of
government overwhelming it with their
power and you know benefiting from its
largesse a pretty good description today
but by then the system was in place
they've been battles about this over the
centuries but fundamentally it remains
pretty much like this it's it's it's
also worth remembering I'm going to long
that the idea that the head of a
corporation let's say doesn't care about
the future that's new you go back 20 or
30 years the CEO of say for General
Motors of General Electric that didn't
care about the future of the firm they
expect they were trying to establish
firm loyalty they were building for the
future and that's before the big shift
of the early 70s and now that's not true
with the financialization of the economy
the offshoring of production they don't
need a workforce they can use cheap
labor in the Chinese assembly plant in
Vietnam or someplace even cheaper and if
American workers collapse well as their
problem since we believe in the vile
Maxim you know who cares they're true
they should have become CEOs like
meaning if they didn't commit
now they can get food stamps as long as
they're around but they're not gonna be
around for long that changed with the
financialization of the economy and the
offshoring of production and the setting
of working people in competition with
each other throughout
