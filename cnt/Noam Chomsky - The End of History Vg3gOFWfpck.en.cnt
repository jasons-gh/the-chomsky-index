what is the likelihood that the US
public which is indeed becoming or
cynical there's no question about that
what's the likelihood it will just turn
away from questions like politics and
foreign policy and so on
is that yeah yeah well you know I look
you can't predict tomorrow's weather
right to try to predict human affairs is
totally hopeless if you look at the
record of predicting human affairs it is
a you know you might as well draw watts
or something it's a much too complicated
business to predict it's the kind of
thing you try to do something about you
know predict if you look at past history
you can find all kind of analogies and
differences so for example take the
United States in the 19th we spin
through periods this is not the first
period of the kind we are now
experiencing I mean it's never identical
to what happened before but there is a
kind of a cycle there's a there you look
through history of the United States
from England with two most advanced
society democratic societies since the
early 1820s there have been repeated
periods which have been called have been
held you know as the end of history
utopia the masters the people are driven
down into apathy and cynicism the guys
who bought on the place where on
everything perfection has been reached
the first such period was in England in
the 1830s remember that the classical
Adam Smith was not the founder of what's
called classical economics he was pre
capitalist he had also a weird ideas
some would put him aside but something
like what's called neoliberalism is
in the work of Ricardo and mosses and
other economist of that period and they
would had to teach a very hard lesson a
new lesson new in human history the
lesson was that human beings had
absolutely no value okay they have no
intrinsic value that's new you know to
go back to say feudal society everybody
had a place maybe a lousy place but a
place you know he had a right to a
certain place in the society and you
belong there in the society somehow
responsibility to keep you there even if
you were slate but they had a new there
was a new idea coming along post
enlightenment post classical liberalism
post Adam Smith or Jefferson and that
was coming along in England roughly in
1820 and that was that people had no
rights they have only the rights that
they can obtain in the labor market
period if you can't get enough to
survive in the labor market then starve
or go somewhere else now in those days
you could go somewhere else like you
know you could go to the United States
or Australia or Canada little problem
about some people living there but that
wasn't too serious
so that sort of meant something that was
the message and that's not easy to teach
people you know it's kind of hard to
drive out of people's heads this strange
idea that human beings have some
intrinsic rights apart from what they
can gain in the labor market but it
looked by that I think 1830s as if it
had sort of once it was written into the
legislation you know look fine and so on
there was only one small problem the
British Army was spending most of its
time and effort putting down rebellions
because people couldn't get it into
their thick heads that they don't have
any rights so they did all kind of crazy
things they were Meuse meaning you know
strange things happening and finally
some even worse happened the idea
started to spread that if we don't have
any right to live you don't have any
right to rule
and that was serious you started getting
charkas charted hum the you know the
labor movement started organizing I was
all very subversive and fortunately the
science which according to Ricardo had
the with equivalent the Newton's laws of
gravitation the science turns out to be
kind of flexible so it changed a little
bit and it suddenly turned out that yeah
you have to have something like what
later on the school of social democracy
so the there is a right to live but you
have to have a social contract and so on
okay you go back to another 30 40 years
say the 1880s look like the same thing
was happening again there was talk about
perfection finality nobody has any right
and so on and so forth again the thing
blew up same was going on in the United
States in one because they did establish
a pretty stable social contract which
can only change very recently in fact in
the United States which had a much
harsher history in this respect the
1890s were a period of real violent
repression of individual rights they're
called the gay 90's and they were gay
for some people but not for working
people in western Pennsylvania for
example I don't go through the history
but you ought to know it if you don't
and then it looked like utopia again
okay by the 1920s it really looks
perfect so there's a important book on
labor history by Americans of the
leading labor historian David Montgomery
who you know University it's called the
rise and fall of the house of labor and
the fall of the House of labor that he's
talking about is the 1920s that's when
labor was completely smashed the leading
figure in the labor movement Eugene Debs
was in jail because he refused to
recognize the nobility of wilson's war
the unions were completely smashed
you couldn't have meetings I mean you
know it's very undemocratic
I mean in fact he calls it a very
undemocratic America but it looks like
perfection finality and the history
wonderful ten years later the whole
thing blew up you could ask that the
question you were asking could have been
raised then in fact could have been
raised in the gay 90's - or at 18:30 I
turned out ten ten years later the whole
thing blew up workers are taking over
factories I mean that half a step before
kicking out the walkers altogether and
just running them there was not the and
they were the United States was forced
into a kind of social contract called
the New Deal the 19th of the big attack
huge corporate propaganda you know big
you know fear concern about this by the
1950s it looked like it was back in
shape again that was a period of
quiescence very little happening people
are cynical and apathetic end of
ideology it was cold in those days
nineteen sixties everything blew up
again by now we're into your lifetimes
you know what happened and right after
the 60s the ferment of the 60s again the
same story and attempt to drive
everybody back into their holes narrow
the sphere of democratic participation
you know put the wealth back where it
belongs into the pockets to the rich
folk and so on and that carried just
pretty much in till today
well it's a repetition you know it's not
the first time and furthermore it's not
just the cycle it's a cycle it's a
spiral that goes upwards so you look
think about each one of these periods
you're better off than last time so for
example now there's like a problem about
the maintaining depending Social
Security and many defending some kind of
medical care for somebody okay let's say
the elderly and the poor there were that
was a problem in the 1920s because there
was no Social Security there was no
medical care in fact even in the
nineteen to 1960s there was no problem
about defending medical care because it
wasn't any okay and if you look case by
case I think what you find is a gradual
growth in I would call it's a value
so I'd call it civilization bulletin
whatever you like but anyway a pretty
steady change in something which is a
recognition of some kind of intrinsic
human rights and you get it beaten down
and then you start again but from a
higher level and I think we're - higher
level now than ever before you know in
these past cycles so where's it going to
go next
your guess is as good as anyone elses no
one's ever been able to predict in the
past we can predict now you can just say
that yes we're back in another familiar
period and it could lead to something
like you know the movements of the 60s
and the 30s or it could lead to fascism
nobody knows
