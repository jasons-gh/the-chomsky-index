tonight we celebrate an honor Noam
Chomsky's lifetime contribution to
critical scholarship both for his
importance to our collective past and as
a role model for being an engaged
activist intellectual for our collective
future now I don't have to waste time
saying what's obvious how pleased then
grateful I am for this honor which also
offers an occasion to look back over the
years when I do so what comes to mind
with particular salience for me are the
earliest years and part because I've
been thinking about them lately for
other reasons reasons that are somewhat
unpleasant I'm just old enough to have
memories of Hitler's speeches on the
radio 75 years ago I didn't understand
the words but I couldn't fail to grasp
the Menace of the tone and the cheering
mobs the first political article I wrote
was shortly after in February 1939 it
was right after the fall of Barcelona
I'm sure it was nothing particularly
memorable it was fourth grade newspaper
of which I was he
I was the editor and probably the only
reader maybe my mother I'm not sure but
I could recall a little of it much more
clearly than the few words I remember
are the is the mood of fear and
foreboding it opened with the words
Austria Falls Czechoslovakia Falls and
now Barcelona Falls this was immediately
after the fall of Barcelona and Spain
with a few months later the words have
somehow always stayed in my mind along
with the the mood the dread the sense of
the dark clouds of fascism gathering
over Germany than Europe and no one
could see how far beyond as a growing
force of unimaginable horror
no one then could foresee the Holocaust
but just a few weeks earlier Christina
had taken place and the desperate flight
of refugees had been building up over
several years many of them unable to
believe what was happening in those days
the same childhood years I also had my
first experience with critical
intellectuals what are often called
radical intellectuals though they
wouldn't be called intellectuals by the
way the term is standardly used that's
standardly used to apply to people with
status and privilege who are in a
position to reach the public with the
thoughts about human affairs and
concerns and since privilege plainly
confers opportunity and opportunity
confers responsibility the question
always arises
to how they're using that responsibility
actually the article that Eric just
quoted was based on an article by Dwight
MacDonald in the mid-1940s on
responsibilities of intellectuals which
was about the same topic and those are
very live questions in those years
Russell Dewey Erich Fromm MacDonald or
will and others work that I soon became
familiar with when I was a little older
but the radical intellectuals of my
childhood the first ones I met were
different they were my working-class
relatives in New York mrs. depressions
mostly unemployed one uncle who was
disabled was able to get a newsstand
thanks to New Deal measures which helped
disabled people and since he had
employment he was able to support a good
deal of family my these relatives most
of them had very limited formal
education uncle who I mentioned was it
was an enormous influence in my life he
never went past fourth grade but it was
one of the most lively intellectual
circles I've ever had anything to do
with on the periphery is a child of
course there were constant discussions
about the latest concert of the Budapest
string quartet of the controversies
between steckel and Freud of every
imaginable branch of radical politics
and also about activism and the activism
in those days was reaching pretty
impressive Heights particularly
significant by the mid 30s you were the
sit-down strikes that's just one step
short of workers taking over factories
eliminating management and ownership and
radically changing the society these are
ideas that ought to be very much alive
today
and if they're not that's the fault of
today's critical intellectuals among
others
well the rising labor activism aroused
enormous concern in the business world
leading figures and quoting warned about
what they called the hazard facing
industrialists in the rising political
power of the masses and the need to
intensify the everlasting battle for the
minds of men and on and on like that
they at once by the late 30s were
instituting fairly sophisticated
programs developed even more so later to
overcome this threat the order and
discipline was put aside during war but
taken up afterwards with extreme
dedication and scale it's quite good
scholarship on this it's worth bearing
in mind that the United States is
unusual among industrial societies and
it has an extremely class-conscious
business community it's constantly
relentlessly fighting a bitter class war
by 1941 I was spending the large part of
my time in downtown Manhattan
gravitating to another group of radical
intellectuals these were in small
bookstores on 4th Avenue for those of
you who know New York down below 14th
Street below Union Square either there
or in the anarchist offices in Union
Square which was nearby the bookstores
were mostly refugees many of them
anarchists refugees from the 1936
revolution they too didn't fit the
standard formula for intellectuals but
if by intellectuals we mean people who
think seriously about about society
about human affairs about the problems
of life with a background of knowledge
and understanding
this consider carefully the problems and
possible solutions then by that standard
they were indeed intellectuals and they
were quite happy to spend time with a
young kid who was fascinated with the
1936 anarchist revolution at the time I
was able to pick up a lot of material
which was quite interesting I used a lot
of it later on thirty years later than I
was writing about the Spanish revolution
well I was among those memorable of
these materials is a collection of
primary documents put together by
peasant societies that were carrying out
a collective spontaneous their own
collectivization efforts it was
published in 1937 by the CNTs the
anarcho-syndicalist Union that's happens
to be celebrating its centenary this
year one particular contribution has
resonated in my mind quite often it's by
peasants of the village of membrillo
quote parts of it in the miserable huts
of membrillo live the poor inhabitants
of a poorer province eight thousand
people the streets are not paved the
town has no newspaper no cinema neither
a cafe or a library food clothing and
tools were distributed equitably to the
whole population money was abolished
work collectivized all goods passed to
the community consumption was socialized
it was however a socialization of not of
wealth but of poverty the whole
population lived as a large family
functionaries delegates the secretary of
the Syndicates the members of the
municipal council were all elected and
they acted as heads
family but they were controlled because
special privilege or corruption would
not be tolerated membrillo
is perhaps the tourist village in Spain
but it's the most just these words
capture with rare elements the
achievements and the promise of the
anarchist revolution promise which is
yet to be fulfilled the achievements
didn't just come from nowhere they were
the outcome of many decades of struggle
of experiment brutal repression as I
mentioned the CNT which is behind a lot
of it is celebrating its antenna
centenary centenary and that also meant
learning so knowing how to go on this
experiment of creating a world of
freedom and justice was crushed all too
soon by the combined forces of fascism
Stalinism and liberal democracy the
global power centers understood very
well that they must unite to destroy
this dangerous threat to subordination
and discipline before they turn to the
secondary task of dividing up the store
spoils among themselves that's what we
call the Spanish Civil War but the basic
the revolution was over before the
Spanish Civil War really took off
crushed well in later years I've
sometimes been able to see the first
hand be at least a little of the lives
of poor people like those of Umbria for
people suffering often suffering brutal
repression and violence in the miserable
slums of Haiti at the peak of the terror
in the early 90s supported by Washington
though the facts are still suppressed
and highly relevant to today's tragedy
in love in Haiti or in refugee camps in
Laos where tens of thousands of people
were huddled they were driven from their
homes recently the drew
from their homes by sea a mercenary army
that swept through northern Laos this is
after years of tried to survive and
caves under a relentless bombing that
point the heaviest bombing in history
which had nothing to do with the Vietnam
War incidentally it's one of the gravest
atrocities of modern history I think
it's still largely unknown and still
killing many people because the land is
saturated with unexploded ordnance or in
Palestine or southeastern in Turkey and
many other places among these
particularly important to me for
personal reasons is southern Colombia
where right now campesinos digitus
people Africa Colombians are being
driven from their devastated lands by
terror and from many sources and by
chemical warfare by us here it's called
fumigation as if we somehow have the
right to destroy other countries on
predicts that we manufacture now these
are people capable of the most
miraculous is sympathy and humanity
despite the awful suffering in which we
play a major part while usually looking
the other way though in this case at
least not Madison thanks to the work of
the Columbia support group here
one of the things I learned in the
anarchist bookstores and offices 70
years ago was that I had been wrong in
taking the fall of Barcelona in 1939 to
be the death knell for freedom in Spain
it was actually two years earlier in May
1937 when the industrial working class
was crushed by communist led repression
and communist armies swept through the
countryside destroying the collectives
with the assistance of the liberal
democracies and with Hitler and
Mussolini waiting in the wings well a
few years after that I went off to
graduate studies at Harvard and first
time away from home there I found had my
first extensive experience with what's
called the intellectual world the
intellectual world shortly after arrival
I went to the standard faculty run party
for incoming graduate students and I was
regaled by a very distinguished
philosopher won't mention his name with
an account of the depression which he
assured me had not taken place it was a
liberal fabrication so there were no
ragpickers coming to our door in the
early 1930s trying to get some pennies
to survive and there were no women being
beaten by security forces on strike
outside a textile plant one jet passed
by when I was maybe five years old on a
trolley car with my mother and there
were none of my unemployed working-class
relatives a few businessmen might have
suffered but beyond that nothing
happened it's perfectly obvious from
Harvard Square
the story well unfortunately that's not
an exception such attitudes are broader
I could mention other cases some of them
pretty ugly but most of the people were
Stevenson liberals Liberal Democrats
these are the people who applauded when
Adlai Stevenson said at the United
Nations that we have to defend Vietnam
from what he called internal aggression
new concept that was invented we have to
defend them from the assault from within
that's what President Kennedy called it
and these are words that we hear again
today for example last Sunday in The New
York Times where we read the following
front-page story after the conquest of
Marja in Helmand province the Marines
have collided with the Taliban identity
so dominant that the movement appears
more akin to the only political
organization in a one-party town with an
influence that touches everyone we've
got to read that reevaluate our
definition of the word enemy said the
commander of the marine expeditionary
brigade in Helmand province
most people here identify themselves as
Taliban we have to readjust our thinking
so we're not trying to chase the Taliban
out of Marja we're trying to chase the
enemy out subtle distinction since the
Taliban are the enemy that's that's
familiar problem it's a problem that's
bedeviled the conquerors from way back
it's very familiar to the United States
from Vietnam for example back in the mid
sixties the leading US government
scholar ended up being head of the
Indochina Archives at Berkley he wrote a
widely praised book in which he lamented
that the enemy within was in his words
the only truly mass based political
party in South Vietnam and any effort of
ours to compete with it politically
would be like a competition between a
minnow and a whale so we can't do that
we've got to find a way to overcome
their political force by using our
comparative advantage which is violence
as we did successfully others have faced
similar problems for example the
Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s
that was an invasion which elicited here
the kind of outrage that we muster for
the crimes of enemies Middle East
specialist William Polk who was there
reminds us that the Russians and his
words won many military victories and
through their seven action suit civic
action programs they actually won over
many of the villages and in fact as we
know from reliable sources they created
substantial freedom in Kabul
particularly for women but to go on with
poke over the decade of their
involvement the Russians won almost
every battle and occupied at one time or
another
virtually every inch of the country but
they lost the war when they gave up and
left the Afghans resumed their
traditional way of life it's not exactly
accurate he's overlooking the fact that
when the Russians left the radical
Islamist forces that the United States
had organized with help of Saudi Arabia
and Pakistan ravaged the place so they
were so devastating the population
welcomed the Taliban when they came in
and many of them are now what we call
the dark
were lured government of Kabul the
dilemmas that are faced by Obama and the
crystal aren't quite the same as those
faced by the Russians the enemy who the
Marines are trying to chase out of their
own villages have virtually no outside
support the Russian invaders in short
contrast we're facing a resistance
that received vital support from the
United States from Saudi Arabia from
Pakistan
they were busy rounding up the most
extreme of radical fundamentalists they
could find anywhere arming them with
advanced weapons while carrying forward
the program of radical Islam ization of
Pakistan that's when another one of
Reagan's gifts to the world along with
the Pakistani nuclear weapons the goal
of these US operations was not to defend
Afghanistan that might have been
acceptable policy but that was not the
goal the goal was explained most clearly
by the person who charged the CIA
station chief in Islamabad he was
running the operations he said the goal
is to kill Soviet soldiers he boasted
that he loved this noble goal that
making it very clear in his words that
the mission was not to liberate
Afghanistan which was he didn't care
about many of you are should be familiar
with his big knee of Brzezinski's
somewhat similar boasts by the early
1960s I was pretty deeply engaged in Adi
war activities details are informative
that tell us a lot about the
intellectual cultural climate and places
like say liberal Boston where I was I'll
skip that but by 1966 my personal
involvement was deep enough so that my
wife it went back to college after 17
years to get a degree had three kids to
take care of and it looked as if I might
be facing a long prison sentence which
actually came very close the trial was
announced but shortly after that it was
canceled because of the Ted offenses
it's a very significant event which
convinced the business community
in the United States the ones who
fundamentally make the decisions that
the war was becoming too costly in an a
that the major warnings have been
achieved it's another long story I won't
go into
well after policy shifted after the Tet
Offensive and policy
quickly shifted it suddenly turned out
that everyone in Cambridge had been a
longtime opponent of the war it was deep
deep silence I should say the Kennedy
memoirists our people who wrote memoirs
Camelot in the early sixties they all
rewrote them they rewrote the memoirs of
radically to revising they were
untroubled and commentators were
untroubled by the radical revisions or
by the extensive documentation that the
new tale that they were telling was
completely false
the tale the new tale was that Kennedy
had been a dud and was trying to end the
war and so on assassination prevented
this noble effort that evidence is just
overwhelming the documentary public and
private evidence that he was kind of at
the hawkish end of his administration he
knew that the war was very unpopular so
figured better get out of it pretty soon
but he insisted to the very end a couple
days before the assassination that we
can't consider withdrawal before
victories assured but even before the
Tet Offensive say 1966-67
there were growing doubts in these
circles not doubts about right and wrong
those are questions that don't arise
when we're engaged in some activity
somewhere but rather about the question
that does arise name the likelihood of
success maybe a paradigm example was a
widely read book by story and Arthur
Schlesinger one of Kennedy's advisors he
it was beginning to be concerned by the
1966
that victory might not be so easily at
hand here's the way he put it he said we
all pray that the Hawks will be right
and that the surge of the day will bring
victory and if it does we will be
praising the wisdom and statesmanship of
the US government and gaining gaining
military victory and then he went on to
describe accurately what the victory
would look like military victory while
leaving the tragic country gutted and
devastated by bombs burned by napalm
turned into a wasteland by chemical
defoliation a land of ruin and wreck
with its political and institutional
fabric pulverized so if that succeeds
we'll all be praising the wisdom and
statesmanship of the American government
remember this is a liberal government
we're talking about the liberal
intellectuals but he thought probably
the escalation wouldn't succeed and
would prove to be too costly for
ourselves so perhaps strategy should be
rethought and after the Tet Offensive it
was recently thought that under
essentially under instruction by the
business world well not that much has
changed today who when say Obama's
hailed as a leading principled opponent
of the Iraq invasion because he said
that it was a strategic blunder doesn't
new ideas you could read that he could
have read that in Pravda they were only
1980s there were plenty of people in the
Communist Party writing openly saying
it's a strategic blunder to invade
Afghanistan we're not gonna gain
anything it's not cost us too much we
don't call that principled in that case
but we call it principled in our case
which is just an indication of how
deeply rooted the Imperial mentality is
extirpating it is no easy task but it
sad to say but unfortunately it's not
false that within the dominant spectrum
attitudes like these
which might call liberal imperialism
they're the good guys there's a likely
alternative it's revealed by some of the
most recent polls some of them the last
few days about half of voters say that
the average Tea Party member is closer
to their views than President Obama
fewer select Obama on virtually all
issues the Republicans are according to
the polls are trusted by the electorate
more than Democrats in many cases by
double digits now other evidence
suggests that these polls are not
recording trust they're recording
distrust the level of anger and fear in
the country is like nothing I could
recall in my lifetime by comparison the
1930s with the depression was much
deeper we're sort of a period of hope
you know somehow it's going to get
better we can do something about it not
now and since the Democrats are in power
and those are the attitudes the
revulsion over the current social and
economic political world attaches to
them and unfortunately these attitudes
though they in some respects surprising
given their scale and depth they're not
there are understandable for over 30
years real incomes for the majority of
the population have stagnated or
declined social indicators basic
measures of the health of a society they
have steadily deteriorated since the mid
1970s before that they grew closely
tracking growth as you'd expect but
they've been declining their last
figures are from a couple of years ago
it's back to 1960 what people but these
are in large part the consequences of
very conscious decisions in the 1970s to
radically modify the nature of the
economy financial izing the economy
and that has a corollary corollary is
the following out of domestic production
it still goes on but not here yeah like
the same managers and owners producing
in Mexico or China or somewhere else and
that means no jobs well what people see
before their eyes and what's clearly
fueling the anger and hatred is that the
bankers who are primarily responsible
for the current crisis and who were then
saved from bankruptcy by the public
they're now reveling in record profits
and the huge bonuses while official
unemployment which is way below actual
unemployment is a at about 10% in
manufacturing industry it is actually a
depression level someone at 1 in 6 and
the good jobs are not likely to return
for the reasons I mentioned well people
you know they want some answers why is
this happening to us we're not living in
third world it's not the Stone Age it's
not third world conditions but why is
this happening at a rich Society they
see plenty of wealth going into very few
pockets probably record levels of
inequality they want to know why this is
happening and they are hearing answers
from only one place
talk radio Fox News Sarah Palin they're
giving them answers and the answers
actually have some internal coherence
and I spent a lot of time listening to
talk radio I'm driving
and it's interesting shouldn't be
laughed at the people involved may be
complete sentence
but the people call-in aren't they're
sincere they have grievances they want
answers at getting answers and the
answers are internally coherent if
you're willing to sort of suspend
disbelief and forget what you know about
the world
it's not a joke and enter into you know
kind of a world of the irrationality and
deceit it does hang together it's an
answer
I think ridiculing Tea Party shenanigans
is a serious error it should be far more
important I think it is far more
important to understand what lies behind
this and to ask ourselves a question why
are these justly angry people being
mobilized by the extreme right and not
by forces that did so quite successfully
in during my childhood in the days of
the formation of CIO and other
constructive activism well just take one
illustration of the recent Silla
stration of the operation of which
Michael really existing market democracy
which does not much to do with markets
or democracy Obama his primary
constituency is financial institutions
they have gained such dominance in the
economy that the share of corporate
profits has risen since the 1970s from a
few percent to about a third which is
tremendous economic power
they preferred Obama to McCain and they
largely what the election for their
funding they carried it at the end and
they expected to be rewarded and that's
why you put your man in office and they
were but a few months ago
responding to the very visible rising
anger Obama began to criticize what he
called the greedy bankers so on who had
been rescued by the public and he even
proposed some measures to constraint
some of the things they do and
punishment for this deviation was very
Swift the major banks announced at once
very prominently front-page stories in
the New York Times that if this they
were going to shift their funding to
Republicans if Obama persisted with this
offensive rhetoric well he heard he
heard the message within a few days he
informed the business press that bankers
are as he put it fine guys he singled
out for special praise the chairs of the
two leading beneficiaries of public
largesse JPMorgan Chase and Goldman
Sachs his friends great guys and he
assured the business world that I like
most of the American people don't
begrudge people a successor wealth it's
referring to the bonuses and the profits
that are infuriating the public they
went on to say this is part of the free
market system and not inaccurate the way
free market is interpreted and state
capitalist doctrine well people see that
you know I'm not very happy about it
none of this ought to be surprising
there was an encourage of radical who
talked about it a couple of centuries
ago this name was Adam Smith
he observed that the in 1776 that the
principle is talking about England of
course he said the principal architects
of power of policy in England are the
owners of the society in his day they
were merchants and manufacturers today
multinationals and financial
institutions and the principal
architects of policy makes sure that
policy will attend
scrupulously to their interests however
Grievous the impact on the people of
England and even more so on the victims
of what he called the savage injustice
of the Europeans abroad he was speaking
at primarily of British crimes in India
that was a primary concern of an
old-fashioned conservative with moral
values might take Diogenes to find them
today
but he's basically right that ought to
be a truism it's one of the few
principles of political science that's
overwhelmingly supported obvious and
denied of course like anything simple
and revealing there's a great deal of
fevered discussion these days about
whether or when the United States is
going to lose its dominant position in
global affairs to China and India the
rising world powers and there's a
particle of truth to these laments but
not much
apart that's partly based on serious
misconceptions about the debt and
deficits and firstly the actual state of
India and China which is nothing like
the image that's presented but also much
more seriously into that the discussions
are based on a very serious
misconception of the nature of power and
its exercise in fact several
misconceptions
one of them has Adam Smith's truism but
there's another one which dominates
scholarship and discussion on
international affairs in the in these
areas it's common to identify the actors
in international affairs as States which
pursue something called the national
interest that some mystical notion
that's uniform for the CEO of General
Electric and the janitor who claims the
floors and this national interest is
totally divorced from the internal
structure of power quite distinct from
Adam Smith well Smith actually had a
sharper eye and his radical truism
provides a useful corrective to all of
this discussion so bearing it in mind we
can see that there is indeed a global
shift of power though it's not the one
that's occupying center stage it's a
further shift for
natural further shift from the global
workforce to transnational capital has
been sharply escalating during the last
couple of decades so-called neoliberal
fury of the period here of
financialization and the
industrialization and the cost is pretty
substantial it includes working people
in the United States and those suffering
much more severely
like for example starving peasants in
India where peasant suicides are rising
at about the same level as the number of
billionaires and millions of for testing
proper tens of millions of protesting
workers in China where the labor share
of national income is declining even
more rapidly than it is in most of the
world China is indeed playing a leading
role in these global changes it's become
pretty largely an assembly plant for a
regional production system so Japan and
Taiwan and other advanced Asian
countries for export parts and
components to China they provide most of
the sophisticated technology and Chinese
labor assembles it and exports it it was
give one example there was a recent
study of this by the sloan Foundation
which took us one of their examples an
iPod that costs $160 and they estimated
that 4% at $4 that's like 2% of the
value-added
it was had it in China it's counted as
Chinese exports but they're not doing
much except putting it together there's
a lot of concern read all over the place
about the US trade deficit with China
which is growing enormous Lee but
there's less emphasis and practically
Naumann except in the business press
about the fact that the trade deficit
with Japan and Taiwan is sharply
decreasing
that's part of the same regional
production system and US manufacturers
are right in the middle they're
following same course providing parts
and components and technology for China
for them to assemble an export mostly
back to the US well for the what Smith
called the principal architects of
policy for the financial institutions
the retail giant wal-mart and so on the
ownership and management of
manufacturing industries and the various
sectors closely related to this nexus of
power all of this is just heavenly but
not for American workers
but as Smith pointed out their fate is
not the concern of the principal
architects of policy well returning to
the charges against the greedy bankers
we should recognize in fairness that
they have a they have a valid defense
they have a task their task is to
maximize profit and market share in fact
that's their legal obligation if they
don't do it they'll be replaced by
somebody who will so that's an
institutional fact not because they're
bad guys and the also an institutional
fact is the inherent market inefficiency
that you learn about in your first term
of economics an inefficiency that
requires them to ignore what's called
systemic risk that is the likelihood
that the transactions that they enter
into will harm the economy and the
population generally you don't take that
into account when you make a market
transaction so they know full well say
the define guy is in goldman sachs they
know perfectly well that the
transactions they had are into are
likely to tank the economy will take a
genius to figure that out but these
externalities as they're called are not
their business and they cannot be again
not because they're bad people but for
institutional reasons
it's also unfair to accuse them of
irrational exuberance with Alan
Greenspan's phrase and his brief
recognition of reality during the
artificial tech boom of the 1990s late
90s
actually there are zoo birds and their
risk-taking are quite rational in the
knowledge that when the inevitable
collapse comes they can flee to the
shelter of the nanny state
you know clutching their volumes of
Hayek and Friedman and Rand and so on
and they'll be paid off the government
insurance policy which is always there
in the background that's what that's why
they put these guys in office that's one
of the many perverse incentives that
magnify what are inherent market
inefficiencies they could be overcome by
regulation but that would have to be
carried out by officials reflecting
acting for a different constituency and
not the constituency that actually puts
them into office well after the latest
disaster occurred last couple of years
there was a discussion and you know
leading economists about what was called
an emerging consensus that we must pay
attention to the stability of the
financial system as a whole and not just
its individual parts I happened to be
quoting Barry Eichengreen one of the
most respected analysts and historians
of the financial system two prominent
international economists said that
there's a growing recognition that our
financial system is running a doomsday
cycle whenever it fails we rely on
fiscal policies to bail it out this
response teaches the financial sector to
take large Gamble's to get paid
handsomely and don't worry about the
costs they'll be paid by taxpayers the
ones who are now flocking to the Tea
Party movement will be done through
and a variety of other devices and the
financial system is therefore
resurrected to gamble again and to fail
again the system is a what's called a
Doom loop by the official of the Bank of
England who's responsible for financial
stability it's understood and it was
understood years ago in fact late 90s
there was a book by two leading
international economists called the
global finance at risk which discussed
exactly this the fact that the market
inefficiencies of systemic risk are Adam
loop especially when magnified by the
policies that carried out by the
architects of policy who were though
their position to the people who owned
the society so the regulations the
extent exists is very thin well
financial crises are bad enough a lot of
people are suffering from them but
they're much worse things and the same
logic applies a year ago the about a
year ago the business world was pretty
impressed by the success of the
insurance companies and big pharma in
destroying the possibility of any
meaningful health reform in sharp
defiance of the public will it's pretty
serious matter I mean not only for the
people who suffer from the dysfunctional
health care system but even on narrow
economic grounds we're instructed
constantly they were supposed to deplore
the deficit well question about whether
we should but if we do we should notice
that about half the deficit is
attributable to unprecedented military
expenditures they're going up under
Obama and most of the rest of the
deficit is attributable to the
increasing costs of the virtually
unregulated privatized a health care
system which is being preserved it's
unique in the industrial world it's also
unique in the gifts that are given to
drug companies
missed again by Obama that's over the
opposition of a mere 85 percent of the
population in this case last August
BusinessWeek had a cover story
celebrating the victory of the health
insurance industries of course no
victories ever enough so they persisted
in the struggle gaining more again
against the will of the large majority
that's another interesting story I'll
have to put aside well observing this
victory the American Petroleum Institute
backed by the Chamber of Commerce and
the other great business lobbies
announced very publicly again read New
York Times other they were going to use
the model of the health industry
campaigns the successful campaigns to
destroy health reform they were going to
use that model to intensify their
already quite substantial propaganda
efforts to convince the public to
dismiss concerns about anthropogenic
global warming now and they did and
that's been done with great success
those who believe in this liberal hoax
have been reduced to barely a third of
the population the executives who are
dedicated to this task and know as well
as the rest of us that the liberal hoax
is quite real and the prospects are
pretty grim but they are fulfilling
their institutional role the fate of the
species is an externality that they
ignore and they must ignore to the
extent that market systems prevail so no
one part of their lives they may care it
that the lives of the grandchildren and
everything they own is going down to two
but in the other part of their lives
they have to make sure that that happens
and that's what we're seeing in front of
us right now
well don't want to go on too long but
one of the one of the most moving and
clearest articulations of the public
mood at least that I've seen was written
by Joseph Andrews stack you may
remember that a couple of months ago he
crashed his small plane into the office
through an office building in Austin
Texas committed suicide he left a
manifesto explaining his actions it was
mentioned in the press mostly ridiculed
but I think it deserves much closer
attention stacks manifesto describes it
traces the life history that led him to
this final desperate act story begins
when he was a teenage student living on
a pittance and Harrisburg Pennsylvania
and former industrial area right near
its heart it's the heart of the
industrial center he had neighbors she
was a woman in her 80s she was surviving
on cat food quoted now she was the
widowed wife of a retired steelworker
her husband had worked all his life in
the steel mills of central Pennsylvania
with promises from big business and the
Union that for his 30 years of service
he would have a pension and medical care
to look forward to in his retirement
instead he was one of the thousands who
got nothing because the mill management
and the Union not to mention the
government raided their pension funds
and stole their retirement all that his
widowed wife had was Social Security to
live on he could have gone on to say
that there are now concerted and
persistent efforts by the super-rich and
their political allies to take even that
away on the spurious grounds and that
may happen in the next few years well
going back to stack he decided he
couldn't trust big business and he would
strike out on his own and he soon
discovered that he couldn't trust a
government that as he put it cared
nothing about people like him but only
the rich and privileged or a legal
system in which there are two
interpretations for every law the one
for the very rich and one for the rest
of us
he couldn't trust the government that
leaves us with the joke we call the
American medical system including the
drug and insurance companies that are
murdering tens of thousands of people a
year with care rationed largely by
wealth not by need all this is a social
order in which a handful of thugs and
plunderers can commit unthinkable
atrocities and when it's time for their
gravy train to crash under the weight of
their gluttony the force of the full
federal government has no difficulty
coming to their aid within hours and the
federal government of course means the
taxpayer a stack says that his desperate
final act was an effort to show that
there are people that willing to die for
their freedom in the hope of awakening
others from their torpor it wouldn't
surprise me though he didn't say so if
he had in mind the premature death of
the steel worker that caught him about
the real world when he was a teenager
now that steel worker didn't literally
commit suicide as far as we know but he
was he died after how quickly after
having been discarded to the trash heap
and that's very far from an isolated
case it's a it's a we can add his and
many similar deaths to the colossal toll
of the institutional crimes of state
capitalism there are poignant studies of
the indignation and the rage of those
who have been cast aside as the state
corporate programs of financialization
in the industrialization have closed
plants destroyed families and
communities and said only rather similar
studies of similar reactions in Chinese
areas sometimes called they're right the
rest built where similar things are
happening these reveal the scent a sense
of acute betrayal on the part of working
people who believed that they had
fulfilled their duty
to society in a kind of a moral compact
with business and government only to
discover that they were just instruments
of power and profit cast aside when they
were no longer useful
these are truisms from which they had
been carefully protected by the
doctrinal institutions while returning
reading Jos tax manifesto and other
stuff like it I do find myself
recovering childhood memories and a lot
more that I didn't understand at that
time the Weimar Republic Germany was 20s
early 30s that was the peak of Western
civilization it's worth remembering that
in the sciences the arts and literature
was also regarded as a model of
democracy through the 1920s the
traditional ruling parties the liberal
and conservative parties they entered
into decline inexorable decline and
certainly it was well before the process
was intensified by the Great Depression
in 1925 General Hindenburg Prussian
aristocrat was elected president and the
coalition of elected him was pretty
similar to the mass base the Swift hit
her into office eight years later that
compelled the aristocratic Hindenburg to
select as Chancellor we call the little
corporal who he despised but he had to
do it because of the master support as
late as 1928 the Nazis had less than 3%
of the vote
two years after that the most
respectable Berlin press was lamenting
the sight I'll quote them of the many
millions of this highly civilized
country who had given their vote to the
Communists hah lowest and crude crudest
charlatanism the public was becoming
disgusted with the incessant wrangling
of them our politics democratic
parliamentary politics and the
service of the traditional parties to
powerful interests and their failure to
deal with popular grievances and at the
same time they were being drawn by
persuasive forces that were dedicated to
upholding the greatness of the nation
and defending it against invented
threats in a revitalized armed unified
state which was marching on to a
glorious future led by the charismatic
figure who was carrying out what he
called the will of eternal Providence
the creator of the universe he berated
to the mesmerized masses these are the
speeches I was hearing and not
understanding but sort of grasping in
some sense back in the mid thirties by
May 1933 the Nazis had largely destroyed
not only the traditional ruling parties
but also the huge working-class parties
and they were enormous and also their
associations which are very powerful and
rich they were gone within a few years
the Nazis were declared May Day 1933 to
be a workers holiday first time that was
what the big left parties had never been
able to achieve and many working people
took part in the enormous patriotic
demonstrations on May Day 1933 more than
a million people estimated in the heart
of what was called red Berlin work
left-wing working-class City they joined
farmers artisans shopkeepers petty
bourgeois paramilitary forces Christian
organizations athletic clubs military
clubs and the whole rest of the
coalition that was coalescing as the
center very quickly collapsed by the
onset of the war probably 90% of Germans
were marching enthusiastically with the
ground troops well the world's too
complex for history to repeat
but there are some unpleasant memories
reverberating and there are lessons to
keep in mind we'll have to expand on
them
there's for those who want to choose the
vocation of critical intellectuals
there's no shortage of tasks that's true
whatever their station and light life
whether they're called intellectuals or
not they can sweep away and try to sweep
away the mists of carefully contrived
illusion and reveal the stark reality
which is often quite simple when you
clear away the mists they can become
engaged directly in popular struggles
they can help organize the countless Joe
stacks who are destroying themselves and
maybe the world and they could join them
in leading the way to a better future
