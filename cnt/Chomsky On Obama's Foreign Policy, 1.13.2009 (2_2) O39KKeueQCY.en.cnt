here that he had voted for funding the
war I mean for everything he's done his
supporters have some excuse but young a
little be different when he isn't office
one made hope so but we have only if
we're judging on the base of evidence
it's working system and the sinister
disappointments learning his first
appointment lyst vice president to abide
is not the strongest supporters of the
war and the the Senate and effective all
the time Washington insider so much for
changed his next appointment was running
moneth who was the the only member of
the Illinois delegation to strongly
support the war he also a mountable his
background as an investment banking and
he I think receives more funding from
the financial mysteries industries and
that in Ronson Congress in fact that
honest campaign was largely financed
from the same sources that's wrong model
t matter what was interviewed by The
Wall Street Journal asked what he would
look he's a kind of work position he's
cheap safe so organizes among esta see
if he doesn't to him so he was asked
what he would do about what the eternal
called the left me barren Barney Frank
who are calling for cutbacks in the
military budget
modifying tax structure for every noble
energy and so on and he said well we
have a pragmatic administration one will
be able to take care of the left wing
balance it goes on through his economic
policy I'm the economic policy of the
FST but his advisor to make advisor so
the people who created the current
financial crisis from the Clinton
administration and it just goes down the
line well it's out I'm his national
security advisor on with james jones as
superbowl extend NATO to the southeast
we should maybe should have its own
intervention well the other question
that I want to ask here I think you kind
of touched on it is that Obama when he
was campaigning he received a lot of
support from big corporations and
special interest and I'm wondering how
much influence do you think they will
have on his policies as president or
yeah well the fun figures are heading in
but the April figures if i recall
correctly showed that he got about a
third or more of his support from
financial
industry from the financial industry
will never graduated and a lot more from
what they call law firms with that
mostly lobbyists that there's pretty
good evidence that funding of an
election is a very good predictor of
policy in fact there's a theory about a
very good political economist Thomas
Ferguson called she calls the investment
theory of politics and the basic idea is
that what we call elections are
occasions in which groups of investors
coalesce to invest to control the state
and he's done extensive work on this his
work will be coming out on this election
it's a very good predictor foxy go back
a century including the review so I
think it's fair to assume that they'll
be a substantial influence a nigga
dolphins appointments and they come
straight out of natural human was
treasured secretary under Clinton who
lobbied to demolish the glass-steagall
Act which separated protected commercial
banks from risky investments he
immediately quit treasure Department it
became the director of Citigroup where
he personally benefit from the break up
that he lobbied for that's a violation
of the government and ethics say that he
should be going to bail his successor
Lawrence Marc summers is allows other
adviser was responsible for
regulation of exotic financial
achievements another part of the crisis
that you want good economist who one of
the few who actually was on top of this
all the way or saw it Dean Baker pointed
out that Obama's appointments are like
picking the somme bin Laden to run the
war on terror maybe it'll change but who
knows but all we have this the evidence
that exists
 you can whistle swath width on mee
mee mee maws outdoor me this organic is
your boo there which i watch i watch
psych final room you won t bump tebow
tebow limo bushwick away when i will be
with where do we go
