can I do all of our viewers around
Australia in the rest of the world this
webinar is special it's not every day
that you get to discuss and debate the
big ideas with the kind of special
guests that we have with us today
professor Aram Noam Chomsky has been
described as the greatest living
intellectual of our time having
published over a hundred books his name
has featured in more footnotes and
bibliographies than anyone else's across
the fields of linguistics cognitive
science politics history philosophy
computer science sociology and
anthropology among many others for
decades he has been well known as the
voice of dissent in global academia
particularly when it comes to United
States foreign policy perhaps the fact
that a dissenting voice like his can
have a platform at America's top Ivy
League universities for more than half a
century and remain the world's most
celebrated academic is credit to
America's vibrant liberal democracy
itself something he might like to debate
us on we gather today to talk about a
range of fascinating topics to do with
the past and the present I'll be
focusing mostly on world politics and my
friend colleague and the other special
guest Israeli linguist and revivalists
professor Gillard Zukerman will be
leading the discussion on linguistics
viewers around the world are welcome to
submit the questions in the comments and
I will read them out we're practical to
do so this is going to be a fascinating
chat and I want you to sit back and
enjoy it so to get the ball rolling
professor my first question is America
may not be perfect but it's done plenty
of good things abolition of slavery
enfranchisement of women the repeal of
discriminatory laws I understand you're
very critical of your country but do you
accept that overall America has done
more good than harm to its own people
and to the rest of the world semester
let's take abolition first of all
there's there are other people who used
to live in this country Indian nations
they were exterminated
is that virtually exterminated the one
of the reasons for the American
Revolution was that the British
established a boundary Appalachian
mountain named settlers can't go west of
that boundary into what was called
Indian country where the Indian nations
were many nations the settlers didn't
want that they want to move west one of
the main reasons for the revolution was
to break this limit and as soon as the
colonists when their freedom they
immediately invaded Indian country out
of the United States is one of those
rarer countries that's been a war that
virtually every year since its founding
it's not presented that way that's the
fact
through the 19th century the United
States conquered the Indian nations
drove them out exterminated them there's
not unfamiliar than Australia of course
the British colonies did it everywhere
the conquered half of Mexico with other
interventions well they're still
scattered in reservations living under
terrible conditions but one can hardly
say that they were well treated
there's another category of people
slaves now they were brought to the
United States four hundred years ago the
first ones after the colonies were
established they instituted the most
vicious horrendous system of slavery
that has ever existed a slavery existed
in one or another form back to antiquity
but this was something totally new but
furthermore it created the basis for the
prosperity and growth of the country
that a cotton was the fuel of the 19th
century it was the basis for the
industrial reversed industrial
revolution for textile manufacturers for
finance for commerce retail
and in fact on the basis of this hideous
system of slavery of the United States
had also Britain to certain extent the
other European countries gained their
the basis for their wealth and
prosperity transfer example well
probably 20% of its wealth came from the
hideous colony in Haiti slavery so what
happened you mentioned abolition well
technically abolition took place in 1865
technically what actually happened was
there were ten years in which the South
was occupied by northern troops blacks
had an opportunity they entered into
politics 1877 an agreement was signed
between the North and the South the
north we threw the troops south was
permitted to do whatever like
reinstituted Slavin one of the main
books on it is called slavery by another
name what the self did was essentially
in criminalized black life so if the
black man was standing on a street
corner he could be arrested for vagrancy
like given a fine that he couldn't pay
went to jail spent the rest of his life
there or maybe in a train game providing
a wonderful work force for the Second
Industrial Revolution in the late 19th
century early 20th century perfect
workforce no unions no protests employer
didn't have to pay any wages just
wonderful
now that lasted almost until the Second
World War then there were a couple of
years of relative freedom and it started
again so until the 1960s for example
late 1960s a federal law required that
federally funded housing couldn't
of afro-americans pure white that's the
we create well from the United States so
they couldn't create the basis for will
but then comes one thing after another
leading to the terrible grim legacy
which is being protested on the streets
in the United States right now seriously
for the first time that's significant
it's the gross of consciousness of Hell
the large part of the population was
treated miserably throughout our history
so yes
for some the government did very good
things for me for example my father came
from a village in Ukraine came to the
United States worked in a rag factory
was able to make it to college he's able
to have children who their professions
so for the immigrants yes that has its
problems as well so my father happened
to be able to come in before the racist
immigration law of 1924 in which the
first there had been laws banning Asians
Chinese fellow Japanese but banning
Chinese 1924 there was a law first one
banning Europeans it was aimed at
Italians and Jews I think couldn't come
in under the immigration law that sent
millions of Jews yet to crematoria
including my whole extended family they
were stuck in Europe couldn't come here
nowhere else to go
Nazis came granny and fascists came not
finished
that lasted until the mid 1960s so yes
there's a lot of successes which came
from pretty much what's going on in the
streets today from activist movements
which press the limits broke through
created new freedoms many ways that
created a country with many positive
characteristics and plenty of flaws I
don't know any other country where you
can say anything different
certainly not Australia yep so so know
that look um there's a lot that you've
said that I guess many other academics
probably would want to see differently
they probably would want to challenge
you on that when we we're pressed for
time and we've got a lot of questions to
get through so perhaps if we can keep
our response there's a bit succinctly
can get through more questions that way
Jonnie follow-up i guess from your
response is that my question was more
geared towards are we accepting the
premise that the united states has
overall done more good than bad now this
is ultimately a value judgment and i
know that it could be argued either way
of changes that no me fucking just
finish the question the sort of changes
that the united states has been able to
go through wouldn't have this plenty of
societies around the world that would
have struggled to even facilitate the
the voices of dissent like yourself or
the suffragists movement or the
anti-slavery movement a lot of societies
wouldn't have even been able to
facilitate that level of dissent would
you agree with that premise you can't
really answer there's a history with a
lot with some triumphs and successes
many crimes serious crimes you can say
that anywhere if you ask how does the to
measure it depends on s ask
afro-americans it's been a horror story
ask the remnants of native americans
total horror story ask people in central
america where the united states
repeatedly invaded overthrew governments
instituted brutal vicious dictatorships
it's been a horror story that depends
when you looked at for me and my parents
was a success
right right okay look we're gonna move
on to my next question now professor
so you've often referred to United
States foreign policy as a form of
imperialism even if this is true would
you agree that American imperialism
defeats its alternatives or would you
rather live under a Russia or China led
world order well there's no comparable
Russian or Chinese imperialism oh there
was in Eastern Europe but in fact let's
take a careful look Eastern Europe was
under Russian rule during the Cold War
period
I was pretty awful Latin America was
under u.s. rule during the same years
take a look at straight academic
scholarship of my opinion the Cambridge
history of the Cold War main academic
scholarly study of the Cold War there's
a chapter on Latin America by a
distinguished scholar John Coates worth
professor at Columbia he points out that
in the post Stalin period the if you
take a look at torture violence
repression vicious violence that was
considerably worse in the u.s. domains
in Latin America than it was in Russia's
Eastern European domains so again
depends yes well I guess the question
that it comes down to know is that at
the end of World War two the United
States had the sort of military capacity
to literally carry on and conquer the
rest of the world if it wanted to but
instead wouldn't you agree that it
actually went the other direction and it
went through some of the greatest I
guess denuclearization program to reduce
its military capacity it also you know
pump billions of dollars into countries
like Japan for example to help them have
a pathway to recovery
I mean this is hardly the behavior of an
aggressive imperialist would you agree
with that proposition Oh
Japanese recovery took place primarily
because of the Vietnam War at first the
Korean War and later the Vietnam War but
Japan was kind of a backup for the US
war in Korea later was sort of a backup
for the US war in Vietnam but out of
that came the foundations of Japanese
prosperity United States didn't pour
visions of Star Wars and in fact nothing
what actually happened was that after
the Second World War
Japan was under military US military
rule General Douglas MacArthur was
basically proconsul he more or less let
the Japanese do whatever they wanted now
what they did was move towards
developing a democratic system the
union's developed collective ownership
of means production they began to
undermine the old Zaibatsu system the
feudal brutal system of the pre-war
Japan when the Liberals in Washington
got wind of this they were horrified and
they started what was called the reverse
course 1947 try to reconstruct pretty
much the old semi feudalistic Japan no
that's basically because they didn't
want any of this radical stuff taking
place like working people developed
through a mixture of Japanese initiative
and u.s. controlled and the hideous
Union used Wars and in Asia Japan
developed in the case of Europe that was
absolutely no chance as the United
States conquering Europe remember that
the Russians had defeated Nazi Germany
about 80% of the German troops
till the end we're on the Eastern Front
the Russians had overwhelming land force
actually Winston Churchill did toy with
the idea of maintaining German industry
so that based on Germany the West could
then invade and attack Russia that was
called Operation unthinkable Churchill's
like he is he had to put it aside so
what happened is Europe was divided
Russia run one part of it the US and
they reconstructed it in ways enough for
their own interests so the United States
after the Second World War was the only
surviving manufacturing country even
before the war it had been by far the
richest economic power and now it had a
huge manufacturing surplus now there was
a problem who was called the dollar gap
there was nobody to buy European a US
manufacturing economy was one collapse
but they overcome the Goa yeah how was
that done pretty sophisticated mechanism
know the old European colonies like
Malaysia were handed back to their
former imperial masters United States
tried it with France but couldn't manage
and they were able to exploit their
colonies the to extract raw materials
which they could then sell get the
dollars so they could buy American
manufacturers but a Europe would be
constructed as a society that would be
basically dominated by the United States
the US for example shifted a European
energy from coal based oil based because
the u.s. essentially controlled the oil
system could have what George Kennan the
leading planner called veto power over
its allies they pulled
to the spicket multinationals were just
developing at the time mostly American
and they that were able to expand and
have a Content European market that
would expand into so Europe did develop
reconstructed as part of the global
system designed to ensure the welfare of
the central institutions of American
society growing nicely multinational and
corporate institutions so it's a mixture
it's you take a look at say Africa sorry
sorry if I can just pause you for a
moment before we get on to Africa I
guess the premise of my question is the
manner in which power manifests itself
on any level is that you're going to end
up creating some sort of a pyramid it's
like a cricket team has a captain or I
guess to put it in your terms familiar
to you
a baseball team needs a captain I guess
if we apply that simple analogy to the
world
there's always been a captain is whether
it was the ancient Greeks whether it was
the Romans whether it was the Abbasid
Caliphate during the medieval era so the
way I interpret the United States is
role in the present world is that it
just happens to be the captain now I
look at it I'm not saying but the
captain is perfect I'm not saying but
the captain always gets it right but
does that captain beat the alternatives
the alternative is that if the United
States wasn't in this position would it
be Russia would it be China would it be
India what you know who else fills that
vacuum unless unless if you're trying to
say that we can have a team without a
captain we can have a multi
civilizational world where nobody has to
sort of be at the top of the pyramid is
that even feasible yeah you could have a
global society in which people are free
to run their own affairs and learn under
the control of a dominant hegemon which
smashes them in the face
they don't do the right thing could have
such a world so let's take concrete
cases of Vietnam for example after
overthrew French imperialism which was
strongly supported by the United States
the United States provided 80 percent of
the arms the friends okay Vietnam could
have gone on its own course we don't
know wouldn't have been conquered by
Russia but I could have gone on its own
course instead the United States
intervened partly destroyed the country
killed a couple of million people that
poisoned the land devastated the place
that the worst crime since the Second
World War
take another country not far from you
Indonesia yeah in Indonesia in 1965 but
the United States actually in 1958 major
in US intervention in Indonesia to try
to prevent Indonesia to block the moves
towards Indonesian democracy try to
strip away the outer islands where the
resources were and take control of them
that didn't work but in 1965 finally it
worked there was a military coup and
killed a couple hundred thousand maybe
several million people devastated the
regime of torture and brutality the
United States with euphoric and so was
Australia incidentally you read the
press at the time the liberal press they
the New York Times not they they
described what was happening they said
sir
staggering bloodbath you know mass water
that was called a gleam of light in Asia
finally there's some hope in Asia
the New York Times editorials say metals
dragons and then we praised the US
government for keeping its own role
quiet
so the Indonesian model
the generals were carrying out the
staggering slaughter that would be able
to claim credit for it themselves
in fact in retrospect McGeorge Bundy who
was the national security advisor for
Kennedy and Johnson in retrospect he
said we should have called off the
Vietnam War right there because the main
worry in the Vietnam War was that an
independent Vietnam might spread the
disease of independent development to
the rest of Asia which would be a danger
and now that Indonesia was safely under
the control of one of the most brutal
and vicious dictators on the world
everything was fine so yes that's
another way of doing good okay right yes
not good listen for the speeches on 4th
of July day and to actually look at the
facts of what happened not just the
United States Australia England England
many France right to this day occurring
are vicious atrocities in West Africa
a lot of nice things a lot of hideous
things ok ok well I want to turn our
focus now to the a topic that is very
dear to my heart as it is to yours and
we've both written and spoken
extensively about the dispute over the
country that our friend professor
circular Zukerman comes from the
israeli-palestinian conflict is is
obviously at the forefront of all
territorial debates has been described
as the most intractable conflict in
human history and that's probably not an
exaggeration would you agree professor
with the premise that whilst plenty of
wrong has been done from multiple sides
involved in this conflict over all
Israel has done more to extend an olive
branch to the Palestinians and sadly
that opportunity has been missed by the
leadership would you agree with that
premise though that is the for right
Israeli propaganda which is exactly the
opposite of what happened well you want
to go through it
1976 there was a United Nations Security
Council resolution supported by the
major Arab states Syria Egypt Jordan
calling for a two-state settlement on
the internationally recognized border
now quoting with guarantees for the
right of the two states in the former
Palestine of Israel and Palestine
guarantee for their rights to exist in
peace and security within secure and
recognized borders Israel reacted
violently
Prime Minister Robin said we will never
permit a Palestinian state we will never
negotiate with Palestinians the
president later president Klein Hertzog
another liberal who was then UN
ambassador said falsely he said this was
prepared by the PLO in order to destroy
us we can't have anything to do with it
totally false the u.s. vetoed and that's
the way it continued continued to this
day take a look at the most recent UN
Security Council resolution on this to
3:30 for a couple of years ago supported
by the entire world except the United
States and Israel it says that it calls
for almost exactly what the 76
resolution did to state settlement on
the international border your legitimacy
is taking land by force for once the US
didn't veto it it just didn't vote me it
just abstained so it doesn't exist
Israel of course doesn't pay any
attention tactic strongly it says the
what you described which is the
right-wing propaganda house Baras they
call it Jim
the further details you've written
extensively I'm not read I appreciate
quite a lot of your arguments but I
guess the question I'm asking is see
your response started much later than I
was imagining in my mind I was sort of
imagining the peel Commission report
1937 right the peel Commission report
recommended a partition of the land
which the Jewish leadership the Zionist
leadership was more willing to accept
than the the Arab hire committee at the
other end then I'm talking here about
the UN Partition Plan 181 in 1947 had
any of these deals being accepted they
would have been two-stage side-by-side
much like Australia in New Zealand or
Canada in the United States and they
would have been able to both people
would have been able to maintain their
demographic majority on their separate
turf is that something that you're
you're disagreeing with well let's take
a look at it again the partition
resolution gave the Jewish population
which are 55 percent of the former
Palestine the Jews it's time owned seven
percent of the land so they the group
that own seven percent of the land was
given fifty-five percent of the
territory ben-gurion the Jewish the head
of the Jewish Agency then the state when
you take a look at his Diaries he said
okay we'll take this because we can get
it but then we're going to expand
further okay we're going to keep going
well suppose that somebody came to
Australia let's say immigrants from
China and they started coming into
Australia and finally they owned seven
percent of the land and then they said
why don't you give us 55 percent of
Australians Australia Australian say
look I can see I can see our friend I
can see her friend thank you lads who
come in having a bit of a chuckle I know
he's a linguist and this is probably
probably not exactly his field but I
probably do want to draw him into this
discussion in a moment but before we do
that before we do that I just like a
quick comment there is no denying that
the demography of the territory were
discussing has altered several times
throughout history if we look back I
guess there was a you could say there
was a proto Jewish state that's it this
is if you accept the the narrative of
you know Kings David and Solomon and you
look at the Assyrian invasion the
Babylonian invasion of the Persians the
Greeks the Romans and so forth and even
beyond that so I mean we're not denying
we were talking off the air before we
went live about Hebrew
I mean Hebrew is not a made-up language
it's a revived language in its ancient
form it was once a living spoken
language on that land so I guess if we
accept the premise that that land is
where Judaism comes from
it's where Jewish civilization begins
it's where they had a booming thriving
living Hebrew speaking culture which was
which suffered dispossession and
displacement then it changes the
conversation in how we look at the
israeli-palestinian conflict right it's
it's a case of the indigenous people if
we may use that term returning to the
land that they held in the ancient times
is is that a premise that you accept
let's take the case of Australia again
suppose there happened to be a group in
China that says we used to live in
Australia used to be our country 2,500
years ago and we spoke Chinese there and
then we were expelled when we've been
somewhere else for 2,500 years 2,000
years now we want to come back and take
it so give it to us how would you like
that look at the end of the day this
this is I I am the first to accept that
the Israeli case is so unique that I
don't think that you can compare it with
anything else it's I guess it's one
extreme to refer to it as colonialism
which I don't do I don't refer to it as
colonialism all the difference is
knowing that the people who
settled Australia didn't have a
historical connection with them that
doesn't make Australia any less
legitimate the people who arrived here
on January 26 1788 were Europeans but
they conquered the land by the rules of
engagement as they were in those times
but the people but the people who
started settling into Ottoman ruled
Palestine from 1882 onwards did have a
historic connection so it is a more
unique scenario yes let's take a closer
look there were Jews in Palestine at the
time of the European immigration they
were violently anti-zionist they still
there were survivors still or they live
in a sector of Jerusalem which they
regard scientism as an abomination
they've in fact at one point pleaded
with Jordan to take over Jerusalem so
they could have freedom of religion
again those are the original Jewish
settlers at the time when the European
Jews began to immigrate into Palestine
about you take a look at the ton of the
Balfour Declaration about 10% of the
population was Jewish most of many
Zionist
so yes they claimed the historical
connection from 2,000 years ago
from the Western point of view yes
that's what counts
because they are that's the
judeo-christian tradition it's our
tradition so that counts not what other
people like doesn't mean anything
Churchill expressed it very nicely at
the time of the when the British were
still in control of Palestine and there
were some discussions of partition he
said it very straight he said look I
don't think that the dog has a right to
the manger in which he lives if a higher
culture and a higher order of people
come and take the manger they have a
right to it that's European civilisation
okay and on that basis yes it's
justified yep well I guess
thank you where is sure sure okay and
and so while we're still on the
israeli-palestinian conflict professor
what do you see as the way forwards how
do we fix it now one way forward would
be to accept the position of the entire
world
most recently stated by the UN Security
Council in resolution to 334 as I say
the US and Israel don't accept it but
the rest of the world did let's take
that as a basis that's essentially the
1976 resolution that Israel rejected the
Arab states accepted the United States
feet so we started the basis with the
internationally recognized borders that
we can take what used to be the official
US position up until the mid seventies
it's the basis for a settlement with the
wordsworth minor and mutual adjustments
was a ceasefire lines of Israel its
territory some kind of arrangement
drawing a line in the through as soon as
the cycle of violence reduces the
Israeli oppression which is brutal and
violent that soon as that's removed what
you'll start to see is some part of the
interactions across the board commercial
cultural others infected happens every
time there's a relaxation couldn't move
I have federal arrangement which I think
from their show some reason to worship
the imperial imposed borders its border
between Israel and Lebanon and all I was
cracking them I came behind the energy
move was a much more sensible society we
must be in steps and the first step
should be the overwhelming virtually
universal the international consensus
which I just discussed ended well no no
the only comment I guess that comes to
mind is that if we're going to take the
the view that some of these borders are
colonial creations I mean you look at a
country like Pakistan for example the
border to its west is called the Durand
Line because it was drawn by a guy
called mortem adorned in 1892 1893
thereabouts and the border to its east
is called the Ratcliffe line because it
was run by a bloke called Cyril
Radcliffe but that I guess that doesn't
invalidate the existence of Pakistan as
the Muslim majority half of what was
once British India the way I look at
Israel is okay it's a it's a realized
country where it's ain't the people who
connect with its ancient civilization
that once existed on that land have been
able to come back and reconstitute their
demography
their sovereignty and if we can accept
country's life as the one I live in
order like the one you live in both of
which were settled by people who came
from someplace else without a historical
connection why don't we then accept
Israel as a country which was settled by
people who did have a historic location
correct the entire world agrees with you
except for two states one of them is
Israel which rejects everything you've
just said they do not want to go to the
internationally recognized border the
other is the United States which backs
them in that refusal in Australia also
does most of the time so what you're
saying is what the entire world will be
saying except for Israel which flatly
reject it and the United States which we
chose me okay all right okay let's let's
invite our friend professor Zuckerman I
know it your field is linguistics but
you might have an opinion or two to
share on this what are you what are your
thoughts on what we've just been
debating well I left Israel in order to
distance myself from that discussion and
I am humbled by two political experts
and and as it happens both of you are
also experts of language I would like if
you want me to ask a couple of questions
that are related to more to politics and
to humanity than to linguistics I would
like to ask a couple of questions and no
I'm I mean my sherry you can join I mean
in 2011 steven pinker published a book
entitled the better angels of our nature
in which he argued by and large that
violence in the world has declined do
you agree with him
norm well there has been considerable
scholarly inquiry into what he claimed
95 percent of human history is
hunter-gatherer societies and the main
scholarship on
Brian Ferguson Steven Cory others says
he's flatly wrong about 95% of your
human history until you get to the state
system there was nothing like the
organized violence since if you come to
the more recent period he's correct
about the period from 1945 to the
present now there have been but if you
look back before 1945 now Europe was the
most savage violent cruel part of the
entire world Europeans got their highest
joy out of massacring one another a 17th
century religious wars about a third of
Germany was wiped out why did it stop in
1945 because Europeans recognized the
next time they play their favorite game
of slaughtering each other everything
will be finished ok so they moved
towards a peaceful period nothing to do
with better angels of our nature Pinker
likes to think his following book was
about the Enlightenment that the
Enlightenment brought this period of
peace really the Enlightenment brought
hideous violence in Europe and the
conquest of the world in the Western
Hemisphere alone Europeans the time of
the Enlightenment have wiped out about
80 million people they're so nice better
angels of our nature so it's always nice
to look at the facts not just nice ideas
now I would like to ask you about
political correctness my friend Stephen
Fry once said it's now very common to
hear people say I'm rather offended by
that as if that gives them certain
rights it's actually nothing more than a
wine says Stephen Fry I find that
offensive it has no meaning it has no
purpose it has no reason to be respected
as a phrase I'm offended by that well so
fucking what
this is a Stephen Fry from fifth of June
2005 I'm asking you has political
correctness gone mad or do you regard
political correctness which is a
linguistic phenomenon as a positive
development in human existence
especially given what you said about the
wrong assertion by young Steven Pinker
well let's take you with me
I suppose put somebody put up as we
taught big advertisement big bulletin
board in Times Square in New York saying
send the kikes to crematoria I wouldn't
like it would you like him well but you
know Mel Gibson told we known a writer
apparently so you're hoggin Dodger now
my point is it not answering my question
would you like it to be honest I prefer
to have that being said kite or oven
Dodger then that not being billboards in
Times Square New York saying clicks to
the crematorium should we also have a
statue of Hitler in the Berlin main
square in Berlin more political
correctness says no you shouldn't do
that and I agree with that and I think
you agree okay this whole story began
when some other ox started getting gored
okay as lulu's was just the things
directed against the left everything was
fine
no it's extending to some of the
privileged people so I have to get upset
about it
does it go too far sometimes yes but
there's something very serious behind it
calling takes a afro-americans that they
have suffered 400 years of vicious
hideous repression unremitting the
grim legacy they don't like it when
somebody calls them nigger or says boy
come over here just like you and I don't
like it if someone says crikes go to
Crematory
now now we call that political
correctness because it's going after
some of those lowly people not against
us it could go to four but there's
something very serious about it the same
with women's rights same with the rights
of other minorities so yes sometimes
goes too far but there's something
fundamentally correct
oh no I'm I mean I I would like to just
to figure out that I understood you
believe that political correctness
actually manages to change and to make
people for example less racist so if Mel
Gibson is not allowed to say often
daughter to win on a rider he might be
less anti-semitic eventually because he
knows that this is a no now I think it's
part of overcoming anti-semitism part of
annek overcoming any Semitism is to try
to prevent people from glorifying the
protocols of the Elders of Zion from
trying to prevent them from saying that
choose on the world just take a look at
the Rothschilds the Jews are the worst
criminals just take a look at murder
incorporated in Bugsy Siegel I think
don't call them kikes don't tell jokes
about the Jews you know don't call them
Shylock I think all of that is part of
overcoming anti-semitism doesn't cure it
the Cure has to go much deeper well it's
part of the steps towards it and it's
still moving towards a more civilized
world where you have some sensitivity
towards the feelings of other human
beings but not just Jews so you go back
fifty years it was considered perfectly
proper to make jokes about the walls
okay a headline and the main business
journal in the United States
Forbes journal in 1932 praising
Mussolini the headline front story was
the walks are
being themselves Italians are finally
getting it together that you wouldn't
say that no because we have some degree
of sensitivity uh it's and as that moves
people who were racists who wanted to be
to say things like that that's their
right their superior they don't like it
okay it's happening right in front of us
tena koe so let's control when your
father wrote he brewed the eternal
language he did not mean eternal
language as a mother tongue of the Jews
but rather as a cultural is a cultural
language as as a cultural heritage which
was never lost at one form or another
but of course so most of Jewish history
people didn't tell you later books of
the so so just before passing to sherry
so you think that your father would have
agreed with the idea that the new
language of Israel which I call Israeli
but some people call modern Hebrew it
was if I use an only theological
metaphor it was on the one hand a
Phoenix that's Hebrew rising from the
ashes on the other hand it was a cuckoo
so it lays its eggs in another bird
tricking to believe that it is its own
offspring this is Yiddish so there is a
lot of Yiddish within the Israeli
language and then it's like a magpie
stealing from America and from Arab a
from so he would he would have agreed
that it was a hybrid it was not kind of
as opposed to hurmati who who argued
that Hebrew never died and it was a
mother tongue your father would have
said no actually it is a new kind of
vernacular ization and therefore it's a
new language no but you could say that
about any language that takes a English
vocabulary has romance or so so look I
know I'm if I mentioned an on the a
theological metaphor
I don't know if you if you follow this
kind of Eagle versus owls so like
correct me from wrong Trumpkin linguists
are Eagles there waiting there they look
at the language from high above and
they're looking for some specific
characteristic that they might want to
get and this is that whereas people like
me are more like owls owls are they're
very close to the ground they work with
communities they work with societies
they are ordinary working linguists so
to speak owl as in the the acronym is it
true that you once called not a revival
is but a documentary linguist a stamp
collector as stamped elected I think a
lot of the like a lot of biology is
studying particular organisms and their
detailed character and then they're
saying molecular biology which is trying
to find the fundamental problem
properties of organisms generally so
that's you could say the same of any
signs that you're happy that there are
Eagles and owls at the same time it's
not that everybody should be eagle or
the detailed work is done it's based on
my Newton study of individuals
particularly that's been true since the
beginning so in 1957 one of my
colleagues was some individuals who
actually working at those levels
one of the founders of Australia that
glue sticks but was also a great
theoretical engines so um do you believe
in pop Aryan falsification ISM as a
cornerstone of science do you think that
falsifiability is important in a very
abstract sense but if you look at the
actual sciences if you have a fairly
substantial theory and some evidence
comes along that seems to contradict it
you almost never give up the theory what
you do is put it aside see if maybe
someday rows will be explained this goes
way back to the beginnings of science
the puffer of course knew this he was
giving a kind of a abstract ideal
conception of what would make a theory a
legitimate theory if it could be
falsified but he knew perfectly well
that scientists don't work that way if
they work that way there would never be
any science because there's always tons
of apparently deviant material that you
can't account for so if you look at it's
it's true ever since the beginning so
Galileo for example his his experiments
were never actually carried out most of
them were thought experiments if he had
actually tried them they wouldn't have
worked so his you look at his a
explanation of why the rate of fall is
independent of mass we thought
experiment if he had actually dropped
balls from the top of the power Tower of
Pisa get all sorts of strange results
wouldn't have come out the wind is
blowing effect finding a good experiment
is a highly theoretical endeavor
experiments are theory directed you
don't just do anything that comes to
mind
you try to refine the experiment so that
it gives the results that are relevant
to the theory every theory that's ever
been proposed is surrounded by masses of
apparently falsifying evidence which you
like after special relativity was
Einstein proposed special relativity in
1905 there was a raft of experiments
carried out by very good experimenters
try to test it and most of them
falsified but not serious scientists
didn't pay any attention
the theory was just too good to be wrong
so we'll wait and see what's wrong with
the experiments constantly so a
universal grammar is it do you consider
it falsifiable or I mean empirically
viable or in other words it doesn't
really matter if if it's not for the
time being it has a traditional use in
which it means the principles that hold
of are supposed to hold of all or most
languages but Universal grammar in the
modern sense has a very different
meaning it's the theory of the genetic
component of the Faculty of language so
humans all have a an innate capacity
which in fact is species specific
there's no analogue elsewhere in the
organic world and apparently it's shared
by humans independently of where they
are and that capacity has a basis in our
biological nature it's genetically based
and the theory of that genetic basis is
universal grammar so that's not only
falsifiable but it's falsified all the
time every time you make new discoveries
that's the nature of science if you're
still teaching what you were teaching 20
years ago this field is dead or your
you know but if there's discoveries
coming along the shore the theories will
change
I mean takes the fundamental physics
just a couple of weeks ago there was an
experiment carried out under a mountain
in Italy which found some anomalies in
the standard theory which if verified by
further experiments will require array
possibly serious modification of
fundamental physics physics orifices are
all excited about it they hope that it
will falsify it because then there'll be
new exciting developments and therefore
am i right that you do not have any
linguistic regrets for example you do
not feel that there is something you
should have never said linguistically or
a book that you would have never
published am i right or is it not true
every every article they write and every
book I write revises and changes things
I'd said before it's an evolving field
keep learning things deeper results
turns out that so for example for years
I in fact most the basic rules I don't
want to go into the technical details
you know it but the basic rules were
essentially phrase structure rules for
composition and transformational rules
to create new structures and it always
to account for the strange phenomena of
displacement and language they're
ubiquitous phenomenon language is very
curious you don't pronounce things where
you interpret them so if you say what
book did you read you interpret what
book as the object of read but just as
if you had said I read what book that's
the way of interpreting but the way you
say the what book is somewhere else
so that phenomena of displacement is
always considered a strange curiosity
well I should language peasants it's
some strange improv
action of language and I believed that
most my life until recently when I was
discovered that that's the core
principle of language it's the other one
that's the anomaly so it's the opposite
of what we thought the simplest possible
grammar the one that nature would have
invented just uses displacement that's
basic element that's the simplest
operation so you have a significant
revision of what you believe before if I
take something even simple the order of
words and the sentence so say that
English you would say read the book in
Japanese you would say book in the
entire roughly 2500 years and the study
of language what's been studied as
things like the order of words sounds of
words that's probably it's a it's a
periphery of language it's the core
language is an internal system at which
you don't see which is producing
basically thoughts and then it can get
externalized into one or another sensory
motor system but that's kind of like
taking a program in your laptop and
attaching it to one or another printer
the printer isn't part of the program
and the sensory motor output isn't part
of the language it's it's something so
things like order of words don't even
exist in the internal language and it's
very striking that young infants know
this without any experience so a
three-year-old infant knows right away
that you pay no attention to the order
of words which is a hundred percent of
what you hear and you only pay attention
to the structure of the sentence which
you never hear that's pretty well
established right now so there are
always new discoveries coming
I'm really sorry but I kept way overdue
for another appointment
not a problem look we'll we'll wrap this
up we want to thank you very much for
your time professor Noam Chomsky and
professor Gill not Zukerman it's been an
absolutely fascinating conversation
we've talked about linguistics we've
talked about politics in world history
and I hope that this is not the last
time that we do this together be well
and let's keep in touch and thank you
very much to our very well-behaved
audience thank you for your input and if
some of your questions were not answered
by all means send them through to
contact at sherry Sophie calm and I will
put them through to professor Chomsky
and professor Gill are to come in don't
forget to subscribe to our YouTube
channel and to our Facebook thank you
very much attendees thanks killer thanks
