pay for it so there was a National
Defense highway system the you know
justification was you have to move
missiles around case the United States
was attacked by Cuba tourism but not to
burn those those emails the butt of what
the reason was to try to shift transport
from rail to highway trucking and
private private automobiles again for
the obvious reasons these are the major
industrial sectors of the economy they
just need massive public subsidy so the
National Defense highway system was
developed at a huge cost and it was
recognized publicly in fact you know not
big headlines but in congressional
testimony and so on but this was a kind
of a Keynesian stimulus to the economy
government stimulus to the economy when
they talk about government stimulus that
means public stimulus natural government
is what you pay run off to the advanced
sectors of Industry and ending up with
that's a major fact this was connected
with local states developing similar
projects real estate interests and so on
that led to the suburbanization of
America a major social engineering
project which has changed everything
changed ways of life shopping malls of
broke up cities change patterns of
living attitudes it's just a completely
a very radical change in the nature of
the society which is state social
engineering a consumer choice had very
little to do with it at the same time
the railroads were effectively destroyed
except for Freight that sufficient
transporting people is not efficient
they have to breathe and they take up
too much space and so on and so forth
but rate that's fine so there's a
freight transport system but essentially
no royal transport system and in fact
mass transportation in general is he
curates radically and is very costly
it's designed to be costly in a
regressive fashion so if you look
closely at the public
rotation systems a in Boston it turns
out that a subway ride for a cool person
in the downtown urban area to where they
go to work is very profitable for the
system but a bus ride from to where I
live out in suburbs you know for the
rich folk clue that turns out to be very
costly to the system so the prices are
set in such a way that the first of all
to keep you away from the system if you
can but also to make sure that it's poor
who are paying for the Emmys is done in
all sorts of ways that's a very standard
technique for shifting the tax burden
for the poorest parts of the population
enriching the wealthy which is why you
have enormous inequality one of the
reasons for it these things just don't
happen because of laws of nature and
certainly not laws of the market but by
public policy decisions are policy
decisions in which the public basically
has no part because they don't know
about it they're made behind closed
doors that media don't tell you about it
you can find out about it to me parts of
the scholarly literature but not in text
books and so on I furthermore all this
is part of a much broader system worth
understanding go back a little bit in
history the Depression in the 1930s
convinced business anybody who still
believed that capitalism might possibly
work and there weren't many we're
disabused of that notion by the
depression it was clear that the system
was utterly unbel-- and it was clear
everybody it didn't clear to most of
business before but the Depression was a
serious blow there was there were
efforts to overcome the effects of the
depression through government programs
what were later called Keynesian
programs the New Deal building work by
1939 the Depression was about as bad as
then in 1932 unemployment was about the
same and so on some of the crusher edges
had been softened but it was essentially
the same link in the Second World War
which was which was a huge shot in the
arm for us industry in fact the US
manufacturing roughly tripled during the
Second World War and the reason was it
was essentially a command economy
corporate executives flocked to
Washington they carried out that
intensive industrial planning allocation
wage controls theoretically price
controls but that was somewhat in the
breach but a well-organized state
coordinated economy and it taught the
lesson that you can overcome the market
crisis by massive state intervention and
it taught the lesson to exactly the
people had to learn it mainly the
corporate executives who ran the system
after the war the end of the war it was
widely assumed by the business press by
economists general assumption that the
country is going to head right back to
depression once this state coordination
and stimulus was taken away and that's
the background for the kinds of comments
that I was quoting from the business
press about how high-tech industry
cannot survive in a and an unsubsidized
competitive free market economy and the
government must be the savior and there
was much discussion about this in the
late 40s public discussion in the
business press and elsewhere and it was
recognized right away the interesting
discussion of it that this state
stimulus with mountain called Keynesian
stimulus to the economy could turn in
many different ways for example it could
come through social spending or it to
come through military spending and I
would have essentially the same effect
as you learn in you know your first year
economics class it's probably true
anyway that was the assumption of the
business world who only ones talking
about this
than economists they made a quick
decision that military spending would be
better not on economic grounds but on
other grounds on grounds of power
basically the prob is a problem with
social spending like hospitals and
schools and that sort of thing one
problem is that it has a democratizing
effect so people are interested you know
you're building a school somewhere
people have an opinion about where it
should be and what it should be like and
so on and so forth and are generally
tends to engage the population in the
political system which is a bad thing
you've got to prevent that I'm going in
military spending doesn't have that
effect so nobody has an opinion on what
kind of a jet plane you should build you
know some guy in the Pentagon thousand
so the further more social spending has
a redistributive effect it tends to
shift wealth towards the general
population military spending
concentrates wealth in the hands of
high-tech industry and another thing is
military spending is ver is easy to sell
if you can frighten the population so as
Senator Vandenberg pullet we have to
scare hell out of the people in order to
ensure that all of this can work
Truman's this is very conscious Truman's
first secretary of the Air Force Stuart
Symington informed Congress that the
word you have to use is security not
subsidy of course it's a subsidy but you
use the word security that way people
will be adequately frightened I need a
major effort to frighten people it
continues you know all sorts of Horrors
it's not the Russians its Hispanic
narco-traffickers or Libyan terrorists
trying to kill the president or
something like that that cat tank
surrounding the White House to prevent
Libyan hitman from killing Reagan the
criminals no black by implication black
criminals and so on you got to keep the
population frightened that's a large
part of the job of
let Jules and so on and the Selom on
security not subsidy that way you can
carry out subsidy in the efficient
fashion through the military system
which concentrates wealth and undermines
democracy and that's the way it
continues part of the reason why the
Pentagon budget stays that Cold War
levels and in fact is now increasing
under pressure from the concert
so-called conservatives who understand
the system very well well this covers
just about every dynamic part of the
economy it's not just aircraft so the
reason you have computers and
electronics generally and automation
pharmacist the pharmaceutical industry
by technology just run through the list
information technology the internet will
take a transistors and just pick what
you like if you look at it closely it's
initiated funded subsidized through the
cross Lake period you know the
development period through public
spending and women if it ever turns out
to be profitable it's handed over to
so-called private enterprise the
Internet has in fact a dramatic example
it was developed in the Pentagon running
there for 20 or 30 years then handed
over the National Science Foundation in
the public universities finally in
