Arina for which is a conception of
infinite in is in that is elitism also
the connection well I don't see innate
isn't an issue I mean everybody accepts
some form of innate ISM I mean if
everyone agrees that humans aren't birds
let's say and they're not rocks and as
soon as you agree with that then you've
accepted innate ISM unless you're you
don't you believe in angels or something
we have some special innate structure
that makes us humans that's not even in
doubt there is you could conceivably
argue that we don't have any innate
structure for language but that's almost
unimaginable I mean it's impossible to
with the most extensive effort to teach
even though look the tiniest rudiments
of language to even higher Apes their
closest relatives and humans learn it
without any evidence at all virtually
just minimal stimulation so it must
follow that they have extremely rich
structure for language again somebody
might believe and it's been argued that
it's just our general intelligence
applied to this material but in order to
make that a serious proposal you'd have
to say okay what are the mechanisms of
general intelligence and how are they
different from those who say apes and
nobody can even begin to answer that
question so the question that we have a
specific capacity for language which in
fact is highly restricted to question
two that that is just mysticism at this
point now people want to question it
okay but it's like saying I don't
believe that the law of gravity works or
if somebody said that I don't believe
that innate structure it makes make some
cells become the chickens and other
things become humans again are you with
them exactly it's just these are things
that are obvious the only interesting
question is what's the innate structure
well there you know there are
substantive issues
lots of work and so on my own feeling is
it so restricted that virtually or all
of language is innate and about the only
differences between languages are in
parts of the lexicon no choice of words
something grammatical elements and so
learn very peripheral things that can't
really establish yet but I think there's
reasonable evidence for it as to the
connection with rationalism there is a
serious question of interpretation I
mean there is a tradition you're
learning from Plato in to say Cartesian
rationalism and there are continuities
but they're also different one of the
continuities has to do with innate ism
plato was concerned with very much the
same problem how how can it be that we
know so much when we have so little
evidence and for example in the Meno
the Socratic dialogue is essentially a
way of teasing out from the slave boy
his innate knowledge of geometry that's
kind of like a thought experiment trying
to demonstrate that the slave boy who
had never heard of geometry actually
knew at all and you know the experiment
is more or less accurate I mean that's
what would happen under those conditions
Plato then wanted an answer and his
answer was that it's in our souls and we
remember it from it early in existence
okay that's that's not entirely false
it's in our genes actually and it comes
from previous business in a sense that
answer and this problem then goes right
into the 17th century and for example
Leibniz
argues that plato's theory is much must
be correct there's no other way to
account for knowledge but as he put it
his theory has to be purged of the error
of reminiscence so somehow that was
wrong
but he didn't have anything else to make
right in the Cartesian rationalism is
from the pretty much the same I mean
it's basically in a you know the
Cartesian rationalist has tried to for
example or woods who worked on language
state of people in the universal grammar
tradition that in part grew out of this
tried their concept of universal grammar
is basically that which is in our souls
that which is there doesn't change and
so on and they develop you know my fire
standards but by the standards at the
time fairly rich theories of universal
grammar
well this tradition then continues
through German Romanticism through the
Enlightenment it takes various forms and
then it sort of dies out in the middle
of the 19th century and he really wasn't
picked up again and totally load 20th
century with some scattered exceptions
well that's rationalism what about in
under that interpretation of rationalism
this is a renewal of rationalism
however there are other interpretations
of rationalism you can you know you can
decide what you want to look for in this
tradition and had a lot of things in it
one of the things that was in it was an
attempt to deduce all effects of the
world from first principles
I mean Cartesian rationalism as well you
know you start with the kobito and then
you keep going and end up with all the
facts about the world obviously this
isn't rationalism in that sense so it's
a question which out of this rich
complex tradition which strands do you
pick out some strands that you can pick
out carry from Plato right through
classical rationalism into the light
meat and on to the modern period other
ones have been abandoned which were
quite central to them if you look in
contrast at the alternative major tried
to say the empiricist tradition at least
the classical Imperial of empiricist
tradition say Hume also was an ADA stand
they didn't question that there's an
awful lot of innate structure I just
they thought it was a different than
they expect
so Hume actually specified what he
thought it was it was principals
Association and celerity and an innate
concept of induction and remember after
all Hume
is everybody knows you know he's
remembered for his paradoxes of
induction but of course he also gave an
answer his answer was that it's just
animal instinct which is what we call
innate so in human psychology which
comes modern psychology in many ways the
principles of Association by similarity
and conduct contiguity and so on and the
principle of simple induction are the
innate structure well that's just
hopelessly inadequate in fact if you
look at the contrast between Descartes
and human were maybe the two leading
figures in these two remain you know
century part two leading figures in this
tradition actually looked at some of the
same examples and drew opposite
conclusions and crucial examples so for
example they correct asks the question
rather like Plato he says suppose you
presented a figure trying some
geometrical figures a triangle to a
child in infancy before the infant had
any experience
he says the child would perceive it as
it as a triangle which of course it
isn't physically it's always going to
have occurred over the line there will
be some distortion of the triangle but
the child will perceive it as a
distorted drawing ankle not as a an
exact image of what it is I mean it's
some strange and describable figure if I
draw something on the blackboard it'll
never be a triangle but he says the the
child will perceive it as a drive not
which which it isn't
it's just resembles one and he will not
perceive it as what it is because that's
too complex Hume looked at the same
example and concluded that he mentioned
it for him it was a straight line but
it's the same question and he simply
concluded
from his point of view that people have
no concept of a straight line and the
reason is because you can't tell the
difference between a line with a slight
curve in it in a straight line so
therefore by his principles they follow
us that you can't have a concept of a
straight line there's a direct
difference in predictions for descartes
you have you have a concept of
geometrical figures because that's the
way your brain as does your mind for his
design therefore a person will see
things in the world as modifications of
geometrical figures humor on the other
hand given his principles of innate
structure has to conclude and is honest
enough to conclude that you just don't
have a concept of a straight line well
we know who was right about that
in fact even without the experiments it
was obvious at the time that human
psychology was refuted by this fact
whereas Cartesian psychology was if not
proven at least vindicated by it
unfortunately history took Fiat the
other turn it was assumed that Hume was
right and the car was wrong well it's
obviously the opposite and it really
wasn't until the modern period that this
that it's become obvious to any
perceptible psychologist at least that
of course the garden is right I mean not
that anybody thinks about a garden
anymore but if you the conclusion that
is standard today is that yes obviously
the brain of mine the brain is designed
so as to identify certain kinds of
figures and not others and in fact
they're simple words like lines and
angles and so on and that's how we
construct their picture of the world but
basically the Cartesian gets conception
with without Cartesian physiology and
metaphysics and nobody would take
seriously humors proposal that we don't
have a concept of a straight line of
course we have a concept of the straight
line everybody does well in this through
this strain of the history the modern
work is rationalist but as I say there
are other ways of looking at the history
you can think other things in it are
important you can think the proof of the
existence of God is important
in any case there's obviously these
