same place the people in Russia looked
Sammy's dud I mean there's there's
plenty of sources of information around
first of all you can learn a lot in the
press you know it's not a controlled
press after all if you're really really
carefully you can learn a lot for
example take say this thing I mentioned
about the Senate vote I don't know if it
hit the press but it was on the AP wires
so it's probably in the press somewhere
or other the in fact virtually
everything I've described is somewhere
in the press know like if you take a
look at that stuff about the health
campaign I mean the fact that the
majority the population is opposed to
the system that's being rammed down
everyone's throat well that's actually
in the press it's true is hidden in
paragraph 93 but it's there you know and
you can find it so there's an awful lot
you can find in the press and if you do
what you really ought to do is start by
reading every article from the end back
to the front you know most of the lies
are up in the front and then as you get
down to the story you know it turns out
there's a lot of stuff back - apart from
that there's quite a range of other
material I mean from church sources from
dissident groups from the environmental
groups from you know all the activist
groups around them so on they all put
out a ton of material and much of it is
very valuable the thing about the Panama
trial that I mentioned is there or if
you read the Central American press it's
in English you know it's too expensive -
yeah you can't subscribe do it unless
you want to spend a couple hundred
dollars but a library could
and libraries so that there's plenty of
sources of information but the main
answer to your question I think is that
it doesn't matter how much information
is around unless you have it accessible
to you and as an individual you can't
have it accessible unless you're an
absolute fanatic I mean there are a
small number of fanatics you know who
you know devote their lives to trying to
do it out of some kind of insanity but
normal people can't do that you have
lives to lead you know you can't act
like a fanatic and that's why people
have organizations like I mentioned in
churches and Kansas during leading
Nicaragua well you know you go down to
those churches people know more about
Nicaragua than the CIA and the more
about El Salvador because they were
working together no and they attacked in
fact I learned a lot when I went to
visit places like that I thought I was
following him closely if people work
together they can find out a lot of
things and they can furthermore get
under you know they gain understanding
you can't really have thought you can't
think independently if you're alone I
mean anybody in the sciences knows this
they're like in this in the Natural
Sciences you work together you know why
you want to teach graduate courses
because the graduate students have all
the smart ideas and you interact figure
things out but anything where you're
trying to really understand something as
a collective activity of some kind you
try out ideas and other people have them
and they react and you know somebody
knows something you didn't know and you
put it together and so on and out of
collective activity you can find out a
lot but it requires organization and in
fact the genius of American democracy
has been the key people very atomized
well I can tell you what I think is
credible but that's just believing what
I think no reason why I should believe
that any word you should believe
anything else no I mean like you know I
write in certain journals
by large credible and I can tell you
what I think they are but my point is
that there's absolutely no reason for
you to trust my judgment I mean you know
why my judgment instead of some guy it's
New York Times you got to trust your own
judgment which means you have to look
and see like I write for the magazine
and I think it's credible but that's my
judgment maybe not your judgment
