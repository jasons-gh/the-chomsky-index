good people good night everyone and everyone sorry for the delay 
I would like to thank the presence of each one in each one at the baron and say that the 
professor tones who had a setback why we ended up being late 
a little is and our idea is to follow the following dynamic is we give about 30 
minutes for him to give a presentation of the political picture of how 
he is seeing the situation is there will be a subsequent translation that the juliana 
who is here wanted to thank and help us with 
translation is we are broadcasting live who can share the networks 
of the baron also the transmission and the idea is that he would do the 30 minutes and 
then we open for a round of questions and that's when we have to 
finish here until about 19 15 at the most because it is not to be so late then 
wanted to thank and disabled to head rio the teacher shows that and have to 
study female I touch fans of heavy journalist blogger 
was 
today i wanted to say a few words about two extremes is still given with the 
press first about said press do 
free world right the vanguard of the free world that would be the press in england 
and the united states and then on the latin american press which is 
known for having a very rightist orientation and with little space 
for any divergent opinion it was pro tork jorge or the golden one in the form of mouth 
as the sun and rain is to begin I wanted to talk about the press 
English and wanted to quote a passage from a book that we all read that is is the 
of george orwell of animals the sale of animals is what he talks about 
that he's doing a satire is from the totalitarian world but that england 
shouldn't be too full of self considering that in england it is 
divergent opinions are usually suppressed without the use of violence 
two years ago a year the hotel doesn't talk much about how these ideas are 
divergent are suppressed but he speaks at least two ways as 
that happen one is that the press is is the means of de 
communication are held by wealthy men and the second is that people who have had 
access to a privileged education that went to oxy went to cambridge 
they simply know that there are certain things that are better left unsaid is this 
introduction in which the world of these things was suppressed and only appeared in 
in his papers and after 30 years that had already been published 
we get to the media from Western countries, we will realize that it is 
these two points that the geologist raised has a lot of subsidy in this one 
press 
regional joao da madeira we got works from a shopping media 
corporation 
we observe the structure of how the press works in these countries 
Westerners we will see that they are large corporations that belong to 
even bigger corporations that sell their product 
advertisers who are actually the real customers of these corporations 
so we have a business where the producers of their clients' news 
who are advertisers and advertising companies have the same interests 
and it is these interests that guide how this news is going to be modeled and how 
what will be interesting to be printed 
[Music] 
the voice of an angel in having no smell of beautiful incense from oau portugal will be 
the second question that he believes that what the abel said that the question that the 
good education makes you know is what should be or shouldn't be said are you realize 
that this is also working a lot because people who have 
access to an elite education have been indoctrinated and trained to do so 
very well to discern what should not be said and not say it 
[Music] 
we can go a step further than what was said and realize that this is already 
has been internalized so there are certain things that you just didn't say 
as you already know you shouldn't even let it go through your head 
and it is something that what is called common sense as hegemonic 
internalized 
the singers james cameron joined the list of those who think go calm back the worst 
pilot's first touch is the first step so understanding how the media 
works like the media is put these instruments into operation and at that point 
we already have thousands of pages literally written about how to 
these structures work in practice and the result is exactly what we 
can simply wait with one is what we can assume by already making her charge 
actions is without study is not but the studies that prove these things although he already 
has been is more than effects are they obviously have no interest 
to publicize them and that's what you're going to talk about now 
pocket is two examples of this are the farms the great great conflicts of 
invasion in which the united states has been involved since the second world war 
one of them was the invasion of indochina, right from the Vietnam war and another was the 
invasion of iraq both with abominable consequences 
the first 10 rock the hawks on the spectrum bank is war 
Vietnam ended in 1975 and since then you have many opinions about it 
but basically divide between two fields one of the fields thinks that the states 
united could have won the war had they had a strategy is better and and 
that this would have served a noble cause 
[Music] 
is the most interesting because although it is a little more it is beyond the left but not 
not an inch more than what is established and one of the 
most commented most interesting opinions was that of anthony do new 
york times 
tomorrow today is that journalist's opinion is basically that the war started as 
an incredible but noko effort to do what was right and we know it was 
do what was right simply because the united states that was 
doing so by definition it would be doing what is right is harmless 
simply because they lost the war and from the 70s when 
it was very clear that that war was invincible which was actually clear 
is that the united states was not going to succeed in not achieving democracy and the 
freedom in that country at a cost that would be acceptable to the united states 
the same bus right mall 
is is most of the american press is about 70% of the press 
American is and does not consider that the war is simply a mistake but is 
something morally reprehensible 
[Music] 
the long ones is every time they did opinion polls the answer from 
population was that war was not a mistake it was one thing is morally 
reprehensible and each of these people who came to that conclusion that the war 
was morally reprehensible had to come to that conclusion alone because 
the opinions that were disseminated were those that the war was an effort is 
wonderful but something is never these opinions that it could be something 
morally reprehensible were shown last night the egg shows today 
but when it comes to kicking because 
erroneous mall new years mixtape in kabul 
is how political scientists finally started to ask themselves why 
people were answering that is that the war was was morally wrong is 
they came up with the explanation that they are responding here because 
the united states shouldn't and shouldn't have liked so much money and so many 
American lives any conflict the other the other nerdy option because it would 
morally wrong is unthinkable it is better not to mention it visit is another and 
uol death was then that it would be easy to get a response from the people themselves if 
you do an open poll asking for a qualitative poll 
asking why they thought war was morally unacceptable but 
this was not considered viable chopstick nobody really wanted there was this 
that response and the other response option your cared for people who were very 
outside the margin of mainstream media like professor johns himself who 
treated the Serbian 
to record students for a rigorous London blue hill 
obama stayed in london at the beginning was completely supported by the elite and 
when things started to go wrong this support started to cool down 
but the heaviest criticism that this war heard yet was that of 
president obama who considered the war 
it just turned out to be a strategy that opinion about strategic error is not 
it is an original opinion of obama, it was an opinion that some people 
had some German generals had in 
regarding the Nazi defeat for russia for example is and we condemn these 
generals but the agent at the same time allows liberals to have that opinion 
on strategic error iraq without major consequences 
the water comes from araguaia in the 80s is a matter of a lack of 
freedom of expression is not with several vehicles being closed the draft and the 
professor jonas who was invited by a friend to give a lecture there 
is is by a friend of his who was actually original from guatemala and not from 
nicaragua and wii is not in 1989 he spent a week in nicaragua invitation is this 
friend to study a specific newspaper called la prensa 
[Music] 
but the other object 
in the urine and the clerk five laps 
is this newspaper la prensa he was supporting is the war while the war 
something was happening that would not happen in most countries 
western countries and and yet the united states not only 
attentive to it as they would never discuss it was not within the field of 
things we could say about it 
today had a workshop is again in relation to venezuela is under on the chavez 
venezuela was harshly condemned by england the united states and by 
other Western countries simply because a channel of 
rtl tv was switched to a smaller channel at school 
it rains he likes and hi i'm cruel 
today, however, the pilot was far away [Music] 
still without god is he with him agrees with a conjunction of that of england and 
united states that it was a mistake by the Chavez government 
he condemns this action in relation to the tv channel hebe disagree with the 
second part that it would never happen in the united states in 
england this would not happen in the united states in england because this 
television channel would simply no longer exist and publishers would be 
shot in public square is imagined you have a coup d'etat and us 
united states for example where the team is publicly supporting this coup and 
always ask continued is circulating in the country while supporting the coup that 
what the country is experiencing year there was 
the funk funk brand 
however paulo costa the problem today i liked the 
pleads for the attack because he can film the show and pulls up first director is the 
left and center left governments that have passed to america 
Latin America in recent decades has generally had an open posture in 
relation to the press so the press continues to operate freely still 
that the press was is practically universally against these governments and 
make very harsh criticisms of governments and countries in those countries 
free in central countries england united states etc 
it would never happen if I would never have a press that would be 
universally uniformly beating governments like Latin companies 
American authorities were and were authorized by leftist governments 
the store is in the middle of the Chavez government for two years that was already in power is he 
i was naked in chile and was quite shocked to know what use 
the liberals the people from chile with whom he talked with that he had access to 
were very critical of venezuela and thought that xavi was implementing 
an autocracy a dictatorship called him a murderer and he was surprised even 
start reading the Chilean newspapers and they were all completely against Venezuela and 
they only criticized and only showed things with what Venezuela was doing 
doing 
we stayed all day even during the years of the Chavez government is not a one 
great Chilean opinion polling agency has done several polls is is in the 
Venezuela and confidence and is of the Venezuelans in democracy and in 
legitimacy of that of his government were among the largest on the Latin continent 
American along with Uruguay and this discrepancy at the time of possession of these 
research with the opinions they had was something that was never quite the 
inter na lisa never much discussed by those same intellectuals who had 
opinions is negative regarding Venezuela in 
field think the Argentine newspaper what is the 
landing is to run another example and ask you a question that I don't know 
answer is is the largest polling agency in the world getting states 
united is at a gallop and in 2013 she did a survey asking which country is 
who wants to make more threats to the world more threatening to the rest of the world were not going 
arise is still yielding a love that 
felt the use today remember by jo 
is this year is that the guys who asked this question the answer in the states 
united was always iran russia north korea and the rest of the world the answer was 
basically united states and this research was never published in the states 
united and after that the agency decided to stop asking this question obama and it's 
it all happened for years the crash theoretically was the government 
progressive so you can imagine the result of this research today is but then the 
people learned that certain things are not asked are not said is this 
presentation was brief but I think you can cover a little of what 
situation of the current panorama of the press in the said free countries and in america 
which is known for being a right-wing media monopoly 
it is tempting to continue because the examples abound 
but we will stop here and open the questions 
thank you teacher you have the chance teacher that is juliana i give you to you 
guys let's do this is a process and the dragon quest means to i ii and win 
it is paulo henrique pedro to see here in front of paulo favor we are sorry 
you can't see rita so 3 then you write it down and there for him 
paulo henrique pedro then you there we go to him to answer to open 
three more teachers we are who i have been a journalist for a long time and today i 
I dedicate especially to the job of doing political coverage on the internet 
my question is how do you explain that president squid has not 
faced the globe television network 
(Laughter) 
[Music] 
the attack soon I don't understand them too but it took the band rock for years 
she is loki this is what happened in brazil it was no exception was the 
rule is the left that was in power in latin america was incredibly 
openly surpasses surprisingly even open to let the press run from the 
the way she wanted it is the same thing happened in nicaragua and 
in venezuela is a diogo government was also hard 
attacked by the press and left it with result to fight directly and without 
to directly retaliate against this press is that it criticized him something that would never happen 
in the central countries where if something like that is reproduced it is sc and it is 
immediately stopped and the newspaper editors and one has one if they were just 
arrested on an internship is he said these issues cannot be discussed 
in the united states i mean can he can speak these things for a group 
as well as ours but cannot be discussed in the press and even in 
universities and in spaces where this should have discussed the chance professor 
good night is the question i have here is to protect the center of the world are you sir 
says in several articles and in different texts and not only you but many 
people from the media including the global one that Brazil might become a 
colossus we didn't reach the operations account 
against corruption such as car wash is operations of corruptions that are 
aligned to the united states this is what i wanted to know 
that was a witty saleh ftmib site center world question quest in 
a fiat idea brasil the club going up 
uai two spouts the house itf is and famous couple 
and got chan in a jeu de o car wash 
kiss the globe the globe g1 
he and I said that this actually became a reality that over the years 
squid and dilma brazil has become has become a country 
the most respected country in the world during those years and achieving the 
organize the South American bloc in a way that has never been seen before and that 
it can happen again 
rita 
I was not even for I come from a board of a communication project 
was dismantled here in Brazil and also as people here sodom of 
movement is probably the most democratic freestyle in Brazil but my 
question is a disrespect to international society that could channel as 
the bag of potatoes signed with society and from brazil show 
Brazilian solidarity in an effective way and particularly when dealing with the 
January state I will ask my question but do you want 
translate before the practitioner must continue it is not like and it is projects 
witnessing this is only the denial of the reality of the one where the 
people followed those grenades a large exposure in full not 
everyone thought here and ask me nothing critical of the state 
is that I am finally doing what drugs especially the sample that the 
curator of the exhibition said she wanted rap rap sabratha in the unit 
could he understand well is it true money in fact the parking lots and 
that's it for me you can think the connection of the information discourse that it rains has to 
always have at each international scene of the girlfriend the head of the people from whom 
is understanding on the page in this expectation to see from a distance I'm sorry 
the question was very long and fields went public to communicate blackmail and 
you passed out two chinas well in 2011 doing action xb in ius do lem

it is interesting to talk about the issue of torture in iraq because so far the 
people don't even know a crime why is the united states never signed 
the convention against torture and even when the united states is like that no 
these international conventions they usually put what he called 
reserves and and those reserves generally say that that does not apply to 
united states so is he 
they signed on to the issue of torture but excluding all practices that the 
cies the torture practices that pt 
hangs in iraq be today called the problem 
is has a specificity on the issue of torture in iraq because unlike the 
that happens in most other cases in guantanamo in the Latin dictatorships 
of what happened in Brazil where the United States generally 
supervise and train torturers but do not torture themselves is in the 
iraq it was the american soldiers themselves who did the torture this 
was considered somewhat problematic when they invaded the 
iraq they needed some justification 
one justification was that iraq would have weapons of mass destruction and the 
another justification was that saddam hussein was bothered by al qaeda 
although the two justifications were completely false they needed 
collecting data and testimonials support these statements and for that they 
did they needed for these tortures is waves to get 
the information that finally the urgent as a cent 
says the untrue information spoke puts the squid field tastes and 
field the final issue of this is always impunity is not because nobody anybody 
was was tried no one was punished by that time maybe people some 
rounds of stature debates but no one is from the army elite 
an example of this is the r15 jose is that in 1981 in cambodia is to release an order to 
what if you basically shot it is with 
with an air raid on anything anyone who had

this phrase is actually even published in the new york times 
in the context where nixon's tapes were leaked and published by the newspaper

organizing here has many questions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 people 
I think it will not be possible to talk to everyone, so I will try to be very 
fast and powerful to read the names of people who signed up for vcp 
that everyone is fine I had written in a certain excuse 
the group vinicius vinicius vanessa mariana 
with your name so mariana so ready adriano you here your name 
Julia and baby we are asked that I will not have it so let's try it 
not see if it will be possible to talk everyone is my question is the teacher said 
that the themes of communication the problems of communication are not discussed by 
big media I wanted him to comment a little on what in the 
his opinion changed with the emergence of the internet and the great 
social media platforms are thought to have made a contribution and face 
a little bit of common sense or if this is producing common sense ship and a new 
monopoly space is communication 
fine 
in this sense it is this framework is conceptual that framework of operation of the area of 
large media the traditional media can be changed modified is potentially 
these new technologies can be changed the taste of new technologies this new 
way to be the first found this great structure of functioning of the 
mind with it will or will not the idea and today - in the scandal 
sandro silva that the issue is much more for people like you than for 
it is and that is something that has been discussed for quite a while currently the 
question of net neutrality and how it works is that question that the 
internet as well as various technologies was developed by people and and 
so the incorporation program is basically being taken and that companies 
like google for example tend to privilege the interests of others 
big corporations and leaving ordinary people other people behind and 
who and ethics in this regard has now been implemented the government has taken and what 
this will probably continue in that direction if people don't 
able to organize themselves to change something in that sense we had the 
telesur would do 30 asked where he was right 
captain in we have data on the lawyers who studied in the states 
United are now working in the legal wars in Brazil children if they have 
also given is the narrative of the construction of corruption as a regional narrative 
also in the united states and also some movement in the united states to try and 
implement this feature at national level 1 and 2 quickly is what is the 
evaluation of the role of oea a in military interventions our militarism 
in the region 
the first thing that the repercussions in the united states of the narratives of 
Brazilian jurists who studied in the Brazilians who are now working in the 
legal wars and we also find here in Brazil a union between 
this between the media and the one that exists today we have a judicial system 
wanted to know if you are the tunnel also interest alliance of the mind of your 
readers and if that simply acquisition from the quick start 
professor james who hinted that ordering is dark and letter a un chan 
and if the impact of the world is complemented the question is whether in the near future maybe 
could elect a socialist government if it is politically seeking that it 
would allow and what impact this could have 
the night was still rainy 
dell technology covered wilson jose ramos horta e costa 
then they say 2 to 2 
this to think about it you have to think first what does a 
socialist government is in the united states today what has been what has been 
called socialism for example the bather in god who who claims to 
socialist is actually a social democracy 
very mild and and if this space starts he can see the chance of a 
of the government on these issues being elected is but this would be no less 
surprising so there are ideas are also new 
the government is already a socialist, it is much more difficult in the option that is 
on the table now although he also doesn't think it's an impossible thing to 
happen one day in the united states is for him what 
what we need to do at this point is to build these perspectives for the future 
in the present and finally planting seeds in the reality that we already have 
am the same human person marks account of us distant from the historic flight and touched 
for the goal and it was a request of what exactly people are studying the 
united states is a known case is that of the latin 
Americans who went to study economics in the united states and chicago 
mainly and became known as the chicago boys and will return 
for their countries and remembered for example those who voted for Chile 
did and during the pinochet government and succeeded in a few years with a 
chicago economists' advice is to destroy the economy of that 
country and this is a relevant thing to think about now if we stop to think 
the economist behind the employee is one of those kids from chicago too 
so looking at this history you can imagine what it is 
intending to do here in valenca and van 
already sold made us try to close in time 
good night teacher i am vanessa martina silva magazine editor 
southern dialogues I would like to know from you is if the 
Brazil based on this non-compliance with the UN decision regarding 
of the candidacy of the president president lula brazil then becomes a state 
scoundrel and in face of this situation is this positioning of Brazil currently 
we must fear for real intervention by the united states in 
venezuela since the protagonism that the country 
Brazil exercised that in the region there was a void no longer has this leadership 
good night teacher my name is ivan is a journalist from the forum magazine is mine 
question is whether you think the era of reconciling democracy and 
neoliberalism if it is being carried out there if there is no more possibility 
neoliberal governments to be democratic since in Brazil for 
example the neoliberal agenda is being imposed through a coup and 
that this has also been observed in other countries in latin america 
thank you west to blow out of hell s came in came and venezuela will give 
[Music] 
in the 90s the paul factor and the uol 
did not understand the question is not whether the united states does not interfere in the 
venezuela because they are already interfering 
but perhaps the united states no longer has the same capacity to impose things 
latin america that they had in the last 10 or 15 years 
the countries of latin america managed to get rid of one of one of a subjugate 
so straight from the united states is not like at the time of the dictatorships 
Latin American countries that they all had not only support but specific direction 
coming from washington on hi little fans 
[Music] 
fashion team work is in 1962 kennedy changed the armies' guidelines 
Latin American security is the hemisphere for national security the 
which is the same thing that you will take off the army collar and 
army against its own population and that has spawned a series of 
regimes the regime plague is throughout the 
continent is dictatorial regimes he thinks the united states no longer 
have that same power over Latin American countries but that is an issue 
again that is not even discussed in the united states 
good evening 
[Music] 
jorge joao e was the human rights commission of the un that made this recommendation 
so that President Lula could be a candidate in the elections but it has to do 
that the un and this commission are not respected by the united states for 
example we cannot think of the un as an independent entity 
because her action is limited by what the most powerful nations personally 
united states whether or not they allow her to take jean on them 
johnny love government is for an example of how and overcomes during is the war of 
vietnam the attacks of the united states still 
china have never been convicted nor even discussed and in conversation on several off 
several people from the high ranking UN un have even discussed with him 
that the question is whether or not to say anything is condemned any 
the united states thing about closed vietnam is just to give an example 
another funny example is that the united states has a rule that if any 
American went to the international judo court 
the international criminal court is the united states can and in saving that american 
rescue this American what in Europe they call the invasion law 
another question of democracy and the end of it sml berlin and democracy is 
neoliberal and should involve the team more and night when it says team resolve was the 
2010 man william together and mail 
if silas and twitter those from the south the gaucho 
[Music] 
neither me nor my motto is again this is a question that is in the hands of de 
people like you if those powers are allowed to act in accordance with your 
interests 
if they do not act according to their interests and and against the interests of the 
most of the population but it is not just a question of the 
liberalism leaving neoliberalism aside we are in a dodo phase of the 
capitalism that anyone who wants to read it knows that we are 
faced with a resistance problem even though the issue of heating 
for example is jeopardizing the continued existence of the 
humanity before that what the great 
corporations and governments in different countries have done is not is just not 
limit the use of fossil fuels for example but how to enhance this 
use and invest more and more in it so it's an example is we don't even have 
words is to describe and that kind of attitude 
but it is a radical example of what capitalism is you should do is 
you should invest in profit even when it means not investing in 
continuity of the human species of human societies but this is what the 
people are watching it happen now is I had ten questions 
we had four more subscribers but we had a schedule agreement with the 
professor johns that we would finish at 9 15 we are finishing at 9 and 18 wanted 
apologizing for lasagna to julia will bring mariana priest year but we 
ends here I wanted to thank the sounds that went well 
efe amanda peet and phil is obliged to all and 
children's ceis love of this finish wi fi internet 
I want to thank the foundation perseu open that he was here with us doing the 
live broadcast and I would also like to thank celso amorim who
