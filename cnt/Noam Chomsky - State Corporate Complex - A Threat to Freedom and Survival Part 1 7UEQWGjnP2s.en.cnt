that there be no photography during this
afternoon's event thank you good
afternoon my name is Louise Cowin and as
the warden of heart house it's my great
honor to welcome you to today's event
with a steamed professor of linguistics
prolific author political theorist and
public intellectual doctor Noam Chomsky
who will speak to the state corporate
complex a threat to freedom and survival
before turning the floor over to Linda
mcquaig who will introduce our guests I
would like to tell you a little bit
about heart house and the heart house
debates committee the student group co
hosting today's event with science for
peace and the Near East cultural
educational foundation and share with
you in particular why we're so pleased
to have the opportunity to host
professor Chomsky the Hart House vision
statement describes hart house as a
living laboratory of social artistic
cultural and recreational experiences
where all voices rhythms and traditions
converge as the vibrant home for the
education of the mind body and spirit
envisioned by its founders harthouse
encourages and supports activities that
provide spaces for awakening the
capacity for self-knowledge and
self-expression heart houses always
stood as the proud champion of education
that extends beyond the lecture hall and
our vision statement expresses our
commitment to offer richly diverse
programming to provide students with
entry points to find their voice awaken
their curiosity challenge deeply held
ideas and negotiate emerging identities
events such as today's lecture
contribute to our goal and to the fabric
of campus life by providing spaces for
critical
course and dissenting opinions and for
campus and communicate community members
to engage in vital conversations thereby
helping us all make meaning of the world
around us the hart house debates
committee made up of students from
across the university focus their
activities on creating opportunities for
debate and dialogue on the important
issues of the day they are one of a
number of student groups at hart house
who give voice to our vision through
diverse programming conceived and
executed by students for students and
the broader community over the past few
years the debates committee have hosted
events on topics such as the limits of
free speech the criminalization of HIV
status gender testing in sports canada's
role in afghanistan dealing with
dictators sharia law in ontario as well
as debates among political leaders at
the provincial the local and the federal
levels given this rich tradition the
committee is particularly pleased to
host professor Chomsky and in so doing
provide an opportunity for students and
members of the broader community to
engage with his powerful critique of the
current model of global capitalism so
without further delay I'm pleased to
invite Linda mcquaig to formally
introduce professor Chomsky Linda
mcquaig has earned a national reputation
for taking on the establishment the
National Post called mcquaig Canada's
Michael Moore career highlights include
winning a national newspaper award for a
series of Globe and Mail articles which
sparked a public public inquiry into the
activities of political lobbyist patty
star eventually leading to stars
imprisonment and two McLain's cover
stories probing the questionable
business dealings of Conrad Black
mcquaig has also taken on the prevailing
orthodoxies in a series of books about
politics and economics including seven
national Canadian bestsellers her latest
book the trouble with billionaires
written with tax professor Neil Brooks
shows how the rise of an exceptionally
wealthy new elite has far-reaching
negative consequences for society please
join me in a warm welcome for Linda
mcquaig thank
Thank You Louise for those very kind
words which I appreciate very much and
thank you for that warm welcome I just
want to say how absolutely thrilled and
delighted I am to be here introducing
someone who for so long has been a icon
and legendary hero to me how does one
introduce noam chomsky my god just a few
kind of highlights or a few kind of
descriptions of them he's been described
as arguably the most important
intellectual alive today by the New York
Times perhaps the most widely read voice
on foreign policy on the planet and see
these are superlative types of comments
he's been cited more often than any
other living scholar in fact he's the
eighth most cited source of all time you
know including Plato and Aristotle
Galileo Descartes oh and here's one that
I've been told to throw in he holds an
honorary doctorate from U of T and and
just when I would quickly add that he's
been a source of inspiration to so many
people like myself who aspire in some
way to challenge the establishment and
challenge the powers that dominate our
society and and yet you know despite
this huge impact he's had you know being
the eighth most cited person in the
history of the world it's fascinating to
note that he kind of remains outside the
mainstream I mean it's we see a huge
crowd here today and and many many more
who've been turned away and yet
interestingly you know it isn't really a
media circus we don't really have
thousands of me
the defense and descending on us the way
we do it would have presumably Aristotle
or Descartes or somebody like that was
here and that's because to a certain
extent I think the media treats Chomsky
with suspicion and and even with
hostility in fact he was just telling me
at lunch that the only American media
that puts him on regularly as Fox News I
think that's probably more out of a kind
of curiosity than any serious interest
in his views i professor Chomsky started
out of course in the field of
linguistics as a young professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology he
kind of revolutionized the field of
linguistics he's described often as the
father of modern linguistics he and he
received enormous public recognition for
the breakthrough work he's done in
linguistics and continues to do as a
leading thinker in this field perhaps
the leading thinker but the fascinating
thing is when he turned his focus from
linguistics where he was treated as an
international superstar when he turned
that focus to political analysis and
that same used that same formidable
intellect that led to all those
breakthroughs in thinking in linguistics
when he applied that to political
analysis the reception was very
different in fact the reception was
often very hostile he started doing this
in a very prominent way early in the
days of the Vietnam War and he
challenged the American role in ways
that people simply weren't ready for at
least the elite was not ready for and so
the hostility that came at him as
perhaps not surprising when you think of
what Chomsky did what Chomsky did and
what Chomsky continues to do is to
challenge and expose power to expose
what it's about I exposed it and it's
full
naked truth and expose its goals and all
the myths that surround it so for
instance he challenged the notion the
widely held an accepted notion that what
the US was doing in Vietnam or what it's
done and so many other countries was in
some way kind of benign and that it was
about bringing good or or helping other
people or making the world safe for
terrorists or whatever that somehow the
u.s. in its exercise of power was
different than other imperial powers had
been in the past in fact Chomsky has
exposed relentlessly that both the
United States and increasingly Canada as
we get on board with American activities
abroad shall we say was in fact it is in
fact advancing specific interest in the
way all imperial powers do and that
those interests are largely corporate
interests now in exposing this sort of
thing he also of course exposes the role
of the intellectual and this has been
some his most important work the
intellectuals the academics the the
media he exposes their failure to
challenge power to specifically
challenge the power of their own
governments in other words they can be
incredibly insightful and they can be
incredibly tough when they go after the
enemy they can see the hypocrisy and the
nakedness of the power of let's say the
Soviets or the bureaucrats and Iran but
they are so often the intellectual elite
here so often blind when when looking at
the actions of our own our own side our
leading commentators in fact you know
tend to be enormously soft on those in
power here and in fact tend to do to be
apologists for power in fact Chomsky
often compares them he'll sub
make the point that you know that could
have been spoken by somebody at pravda
and by the way when you hear that it at
first it sort of jars you when you
actually go through and read his stuff
it's so relentless it's so meticulous
it's so careful you coming on what you
come away realizing he's absolutely
right and when you do that of course
you'll never feel the same about Peter
Mansbridge again and in doing this of
course Chomsky's focusing on the
abdication of responsibility on the part
of intellectuals that on our side you
know when they see atrocities committed
by our side and wars abroad you know
they talk about well things may have
gone wrong that shouldn't have happened
there was a little collateral damage but
in fact what Chomsky so clearly shows it
is that this is part of systemic
ruthless exercise of power advancing
very specific interests interests of
corporate power and that it's done with
an absolute reckless callous regard or
indifference for people around the world
and in this way by doing this you know
the are intellectuals and failing to
pick up on though on what our elite is
doing is in a sec providing a sort of
cover for them I was reminded of this a
couple years ago member when after the
war in Iraq and it was finally
acknowledged clearly that the war in
Iraq had been about had not been about
weapons of mass destruction I think Dick
Cheney eventually even acknowledged it
now that's a kind of crucial revelation
right and I remember watching Wolf
Blitzer on CNN and he was kind of
scratching his head and said my goodness
how could we have all god it's so wrong
and i was thinking we you know i
remember before the invasion of iraq i
remember 10 million people out in the
streets
all over the world protesting that
invasion they somehow didn't get it
wrong they in fact I remember them
carrying signs you know how did their
oil get how do I royal get under their
sand you know and I mean they understood
that the invasion probably wouldn't have
happened if it rock was instead of
sitting on a ton of oil was sitting on
let's say a ton of carrots or something
but somehow wolf blitzer and the people
in the media didn't get that they didn't
get it because they didn't have the same
skepticism that ordinary people have and
they didn't ask the tough questions even
though they were very much in a position
to ask those tough questions and so as a
result they let those in power slither
away well Chomsky never lets those in
power slither away in that sense he is
the true public intellectual now of
course all this is particularly
important takes on particular meeting
the role of the intellectual when we're
talking about the University because
here at the University we think of this
as a place of critical inquiry if
anywhere is going to challenge the
prevailing norms and the prevailing
ideas it's going to be here at the
University and actually if you read the
U of T statement of purpose you see some
incredibly strong statements about how
you know and this is on the U of T
governing councils website we affirm
that the university's unique concept the
most crucial of all human rights are the
rights of freedom of speech academic
freedom freedom of research we affirm
that these rights are meaningless unless
they entail the right to raise deeply
disturbing questions and provocative
challenge to the cherished beliefs of
society at large and the university
itself it is this human right to radical
critical teaching and research with
which the university as a duty above all
to be concerned because there is no one
else no other institution no other
office in our modern liberal democracy
which is the custodian of this most
precious and vulnerable right of the
liberated human spirit Wow and that
powerful it almost brings tears to your
eyes a powerful statement of the
university is an important body to keep
accountable those in power and those and
to keep and a critical eye on what's
going on in fact in reality the
university often i must say feels to
live up to this of course many of you
are familiar with the situation of the
Munk school of global affairs the 35
million dollar donation given by Peter
Munk the CEO of barrick gold to set up a
school of global affairs and this of
course raises the question you know will
that school encourage the kind of
investigation of let's say mining
companies operating the third world that
a school of global affairs logically
should I can say from looking at the
Munk agreement with u of t that there's
reason to worry about this that in fact
monk has more influenced and then one
would would want that the biggest part
of his door a big part of his donation
15 million is only to be given down the
road and only after he's satisfied with
the direction of the school he also
specify than agreement that the monks
school will be in this beautiful
heritage building and only the senior
professors and their guests will be
allowed to enter by the front door that
everybody else the junior faculty the
public the students will enter by the
back door anyway you may know there's a
protest this afternoon in fact right
after this event there's a protest going
before the governing council to in out
in front of the governing council to
urge them to reconsider this this whole
monk situation and professor Chomsky has
indicated that he plans to attend
in fact he's invited me to go along with
them and you know if any one of you
wanted to come along too we could make
it a party and I just want to point out
that we will be entering by the front
door now I dropped off professor Chomsky
last night at his hotel after his speech
out of T Scarborough and I was struck by
the fact that I pulled up in a taxi
driver started honking at me and I
thought oh boy I you know parked in the
wrong place or something God was really
insistent and it turned out it was just
he was so excited there was no harm
escape who he'd seen back in his native
Greece years ago and always you know
remained a huge fan of and this just
kind of reminded me why Chomsky is in
fact the most important intellectual
alive today that you know he exposes
those in power and the way they exercise
and abuse power and the elites that
cooperate and cover up for them and he
does all this in the public interest in
the interests of the common person and
and I you know more than any individual
today I think it can be truly said that
Noam Chomsky speaks truth to power I
give you know'm tomski
Thanks well I'm I'm going to talk mostly
about the United States in part because
I know it better but also in part
because of its unique significance in
the global system that's been true
dramatically since the Second World War
the character an extent of this
uniqueness often isn't understood and
would be easily worth it talking itself
but I won't go into that however we
constantly see that even in relatively
small ways so for example when a housing
bubble in the United States burst a
couple of years ago that initiated a
global economic crisis which most of the
world is still mired in the worst
outcomes were just averted by quite
desperate measures in another domain
when France and Britain wanted to mom
Libya a couple of weeks ago they had to
turn to a more reluctant Washington to
do the heavy lifting and provide the
vast bulk of the means of violence US
has a huge comparative advantage in that
domain furthermore although the United
States us society and its political
economy are unusual in some respects
it's not that different from elsewhere
the and in fact developments within the
United States over the years have often
foreshadowed what is going to happen
pretty soon in other industrial
societies of the state capitalist world
well the that world in fact the whole
world is of course always changing but
there are significant continent
and they're worth bearing in mind 1
continuity is that those who control the
economic life of the country also tend
to have overwhelming influence over
state policy that should be a truism
taught in elementary school that was
formed succinctly by Adam Smith and
words that I've quoted before but are
important enough to repeat he speaking
of Britain of course he wrote that the
principal architects of policy are the
owners of the society in his day the
merchants and manufacturers the Masters
of mankind as he called them and they
ensure that state policy serves their
interest however Grievous the effect on
others including the domestic population
but primarily the victims of what he
called their savage and justice abroad
and India was his prime example there
was an early in the days of the
destruction of India well today the
Masters of mankind are multinational
corporations and financial institutions
but the lesson still applies and it
helps explain why the state corporate
complex is indeed a threat to freedom
and in fact even survival well by now
there are important elaborations of
smith's truism applied to the modern
world the most significant and
sophisticated version that i know is by
political economist Thomas Ferguson what
he calls his investment theory of
politics which in brief and simplified
essentially views us elections
as occasions in which coalition's of
private investors coalesce to invest to
control the state it turns out to be a
thesis is quite high predictive success
over more than a century as he shows
what it means in effect is that
elections are pretty much bought and
that the buyers expect to be rewarded
and that happens all the time was
illustrated very clearly in the last US
presidential election 2008 president
obama's victory traces largely to a huge
influx of capital from the financial
institutions especially toward the end
of the campaign they prefer preferred
him to his opponent mccain and they
expected to be rewarded and of course
they were the country at that time was
mired in a deep recession so Obama's
first act was to select an economic team
it was drawn almost entirely from those
would cause the severe economic crisis
that he inherited he systematically
avoided critics of their practices
including quite prestigious ones Nobel
laureates actually the business press
wrote rather ironically about this
Bloomberg News did a review of Obama's
economic team went through each one of
them looked at their records and said
concluded that these people shouldn't be
on the economic team to fix up the
economy they should be getting subpoenas
which was pretty correct they didn't of
course well not surprisingly the team
chose measures which rewarded the major
culprits who are
a richer and more powerful than before
and poised to lead the way to the next
and probably more severe financial
crisis now there was recently an
interesting article about this by the
special inspector of the bailout
programs Neil Barofsky he wrote a bitter
condemnation of the way it was executed
he points out that the legislative act
that authorized the bailout was a
bargain the financial institutions that
were responsible for the crisis would be
saved by the taxpayer and the victims of
their misdeeds in fact real crimes the
victims would be somewhat compensated by
measures to protect home values and
preserve homeownership mostly housing
crisis well only the first part of the
bargain was kept the financial
institutions were rewarded lavishly for
causing the crisis and they were
forgiven for outright crimes but the
rest of the program flounder as ross key
points out i'm quoting him foreclosures
continue to mount with 8 to 13 million
filings forecast over the program's
lifetime well the biggest banks are
twenty percent larger than they were
before the crisis and control the larger
part of the economy than ever they
reasonably assumed that the government
will rescue them again if necessary in
the credit rating agencies credit rating
agencies incorporate future government
market bailouts into their assessments
of the largest bank that means
exaggerating market distortions that
provide them with an unfair advantage
over smaller institutions which continue
to struggle so in short as he puts it
Obama's program
were a giveaway to Wall Street
executives and a blow in the solar
plexus to their defenseless victims in
other words the government listened to
those who have a voice in the political
system and acted accordingly all
completely in accord with Smith's truism
well there should be no surprises here
there are careful studies of Senate
votes over a long period and they show
that the Senate is indeed responsive to
a sector of the population the top third
and income actually a closer analysis
which oh that it's a very small fraction
of that top third in contrast there's no
correlation at all between Senate votes
and opinions of the middle third for the
bottom third there is a correlation it's
negative Senate votes are countered the
preferences for the bottom third and on
major issues of foreign and domestic
policy there's quite a sharp disconnect
between public opinion and public policy
over a long period well one might argue
that these results don't really depart
very far from the intentions of the
founders of the society so James Madison
who was the main framer of the
constitutional order he explained to the
Constitutional Convention that power
should remain in the hands of the Senate
the Senate was not chosen directly by
voters until about a century ago in
those days the executive was pretty much
an administrator not
ver and the house third part of the
system which is closer to the public had
much more limited authority and that's
the way in fact it was set up miss Mott
Madison explained to the Constitutional
Convention the Senate represents the
wealth of the nation the more capable
set of men men who have respect for
property owners and their rights and
understand that government must protect
the minority of the opulent against the
majority that's quite accurate something
else that ought to be taught in
elementary school we should bear in mind
however in kind of in Madison's defense
that his mentality was pre-capitalist so
he assumed
