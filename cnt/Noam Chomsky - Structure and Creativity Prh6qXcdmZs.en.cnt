well it's true that our genetic program
rigidly constrains us I think the more
important point is that the existence of
that rich of that rigid constraint is
what provides the basis for our freedom
and creativity and the reason I mean
it's only because we have pre-programmed
but we can do all things and exactly the
point is that if we really were plastic
organisms without an extensive
pre-programming then the state that our
mind achieves would in fact be a
reflection of the environment which
means it would be extraordinarily
impoverished fortunately for us
we're rigidly pre-programmed with
extremely rich systems that are part of
our biological endowment I want to just
ask you about structure and creativity
so what I found most interesting about
your work on language is that you
correlated you know creativity and the
kind of infinite like potential of
language the fact with the fact that
it's restricted and I think you said
it's precisely those characteristics of
language that make it an effective
instrument for free thought and
expression seem to have their origins in
this innately determined structure so
I'm just wondering what this apparent
paradox structure promoting creativity
suggests about the nature of creative
talent because it's normally associated
maybe that's in its perception with an
absence of structure and that's what
creativity is so and how does that
reflect itself in the classroom that's
true that that's commonly thought that
can possibly be true I mean it's like it
takes a the growth of an organism say an
amoeba or a human being a human being
has a a lot of complex capacities and
characteristics even a complex internal
structure like the way your digestive
system works and so on I can do a lot of
things but that's because we're designed
within a framework that allows certain
options and blocks others suppose that
the genetic endowment said become
anything okay so arbitrarily you'd end
up some lump of something or other with
no capacities and no ability to do
anything it's the same with the Arts so
this was understood in class
aesthetics so if you read the aesthetic
theories of the 8th 17th 18th century
they understood that creativity
presupposes a set of rules forms and
rules if you you can you can challenge
the rules and like it can be one form of
creativity is challenging the rules if
you have no structure and though rules
at all its you know it's like the
tossing paint at the wall the right
that's not not a creative egg this is a
value of dissonance well there's got to
be some structure that provides you with
capacities if you don't have internal
structure this is for growth and
development but he'd be the same for say
creative activity is so what kind of
structures support creativity and what
kind of structures inhibit creativity
structures that supportive or misleading
a sonnet there are rules for sonnet okay
that framework of rules enables people
to do really creative work you know you
read classical Sun instance if you had
no rules at all you just then I could
write poetry I can't and the structure
that's there has to be or takes a
painting here - it's been studying the
history of art by Marsh Bureau and
others a painting is in a frame
well that alone imposes structure it's
on a flat surface okay that requires you
to invent perspective and a long time
before people understood it and how to
make it look like a gown that's flowing
you know okay that that frame itself
just that simple even that simple frame
already imposed this sets the conditions
under which you can carry out creative
acts in a loneliness of my life my
father dead my mother dead my mother far
away
insisted my wife far away nothing here
with my own tragic hands that once we're
rotted by a world a sweet attention
let's take like Jack Kerouac on the road
that that's somehow less creative in
Lochner but first he did he had no rules
he was just he was like not a promoting
he might thought he had no rules but if
you look he did it's pretty structured
and otherwise it just many random sins
that's coming out it was nothing like
that hard to follow the back anyway well
I don't think it's random
it's not the you know free association
right and if it was it would be of no
interest rate and there's development
and plot and so on I'm even concept like
plot and development or an aesthetic
frame rate you don't want the framework
to be so rigid that you always do the
same thing like a detective story where
Perry Mason strays everyone's the same
as the last month you don't want that
but a framework which is rigid enough to
meet to make it possible to carry out
creative acts but doesn't inhibit the
kind of like your your elementary school
experience which is teachers like that
present information that might be
worthwhile evaluating and allowing kids
to independently you know or it's like
there's laying out the string model of
Education there's got to be something
there's got to be something there to
work with and what's there should be
challenging enough so you want to see
what you can discover within that
framework and then raise questions about
the framework
