if I could convince myself that
attainment of power by the proletariat
would lead to a terroristic police state
in which freedom and dignity and decent
human relations would be destroyed then
I wouldn't want the proletariat to take
power in fact the only reason for
wanting any such thing I believe is
because one thinks rightly or wrongly
that some fundamental human values will
be achieved by that transfer of power

Rio poor Italia you know Kassim Lee has
to sit on parade you work well I'm not
at all satisfied with that theory of
revolution for a lot of reasons
historical and other but even if one
were to accept it for the sake of
argument still that theory is holding
that it is maintaining that it is proper
for the proletariat to take power and
exercise it in a violent and bloody and
unjust fashion because it is claimed in
my opinion falsely that that will be
that that will lead to a more just
society in which the state will wither
away in which the proletariat will be a
universal class and so on and so forth
if it weren't for that further
justification the
the concept of a dictatorship of the
proletariat violent and bloody would
certainly be unjust at least I I for
example I'm not a committed pacifist
that is I don't say I would not hold
that it is under all imaginable
circumstances wrong to use violence even
though use of violence is in some sense
unjust I believe the one has to estimate
relative and justices but the use of
violence and the creation of some degree
of injustice can only itself be
justified on the basis of the claim and
the assessment which always ought to be
undertaken very very seriously
and with a good deal of skepticism that
this violence is being exercised because
a more just result is going to be
achieved if it does not have that
grounding it really is totally immoral

that will be achieved it is claimed
there's a just end if the no you know
Leninist or whatever you like would dare
to say we have a right to take power
let's say we the proletariat and then
throw everyone else into crematoria
let's say I mean if that were the
consequence of the proletariat taking
power of course it would not be
appropriate the idea is and as for
reasons I mentioned I'm sceptical about
it but a period of violent dictatorship
of perhaps violent and bloody
dictatorship is justified because that
will mean the submergence
termination of class of class oppression
a proper end to achieve in human life
