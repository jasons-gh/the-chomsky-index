who is going to be the next president
the the Honduran people decided that
having exercised their choice between
two supporters of the military coup that
ousted the elected president as often in
the past the u.s. separated itself from
almost all of Latin America and in this
case even from Europe in this brazen act
of contempt for democracy and human
rights in the wake of the Brazilian coo
of 1964 a monstrous plague of repression
spread through the hemisphere it
included the what's in Latin America is
called the first 911 namely not in Chile
in 1973 which planning objective measure
was far more severe than what we call
911 it included the killers and the
torturers of in Argentina who were
Reagan's favors it finally reached
Central America through the 1980s in the
course of the terror and slaughter of
the practitioners of liberation theology
were a prime target among them the
martyrs of the church whose execution 20
years ago is now commemorated with a
resounding silence barely broken
forgotten almost completely our huda
Elba and Selena the one survivor of the
massacre feather young Sabrina reminds
us that they are the symbols of the
suffering masses of El Salvador and
indeed of the world there's been much
debate about who deserves the credit for
the fall of the Berlin Wall it was also
the topic of a recent meeting in Berlin
of the three presidents most directly
involved Germany's Helmut Kohl concluded
the meeting by saying I know now how
heaven helped us George HW Bush
generously praised the east
German people who for too long had been
deprived of their god-given rights
Gorbachev suggested that the US needs
its own perestroika there are no such
doubts about the demolition of the
attempt to revive the Church of the
Gospels the School of the Americas now
renamed which is famous for its training
of Latin American killers proudly
announces as one of its talking points
that liberation theology was defeated
with the assistance of the US Army given
a helping hand to be sure by the Vatican
using the gentler means of expulsion and
suppression the bitter campaign to
reverse the set the heresy that was set
in motion by Vatican to that has
received the incomparable literary
expression and dusty s Keys parable of
the Grand Inquisitor in this tale was
sure you know said in Seville the quoted
it in the most terrible time of the
Inquisition Jesus Christ suddenly
appeared on the streets softly
unobserved and yet strange to say
everyone recognized him and was
irresistibly drawn to him the Grand
Inquisitor recognizing the grave danger
bid's the guards take him and lead him
away to prison where the old man accuses
Christ of coming to hinder us in our
great work of destroying the subversive
ideas of freedom and community that we
have taken the sword of Caesar and
follow him not thee the Inquisitor
admonished Jesus that we seek to be the
rulers of the earth so that we can teach
the week and vile multitude that they
will only become free when they renounce
their freedom to us and submit to us
then they will be timid and frightened
and happy so tomorrow I must burn thee
and put an end
today evil ways but finally the old man
relented and let him out into the dark
alleys of the town the prisoner went
away noticed that the pupils of Port
Fort Bragg learned a rather harsher
lesson in 1977 the highly respected
Jesuit priest ratito grande preached in
El Salvador of his fears that very soon
the Bible and the Gospels will not be
allowed within our country will get the
covers and nothing more because all of
its pages are subversive and I fear my
brother's that if Jesus of Nazareth
returned they would arrest him they
would take him to the courts and accuse
him of being unconstitutional and
subversive his insight into policy was
all too accurate a few weeks later he
was assassinated again by the same hands
first of the series of assassinations in
Central America of Jesuit priests well
these two events the collapse of Russian
tyranny and the destruction of the evil
ways of the Gospels were linked
symbolically when the hero of 1989 wats
love Havel came to Washington shortly
after the assassination of his
Salvadoran counterparts he spoke before
a joint session of Congress and he
received thunderous applause when he
praised the United States as the
defenders of freedom the intellectual
classes were entranced at the extreme
dissident end Anthony Lewis hailed Havel
for teaching us that we live in a
Romantic Age The Washington Post
described hovels message as a voice of
conscience that speaks compellingly of
the responsibilities that large and
small powers Oh each other and under
others wondered why American
intellectuals do not ascend these lofty
heights
well when can imagine the reaction if
the circumstances had been reversed it's
a thought experiment that's the excuse
phul to carry out could teach us a lot
about ourselves well let's turn to the
second track policy how did policymakers
react to the fall of the wall initiating
the unipolar moment a few a few weeks
later the United States invaded Panama
the purpose was to kidnap a minor thug
who was brought to Florida and sentenced
for crimes that he committed for the
most part while on the CIA payroll he
had switched from valued friend to evil
demon by dragging his feet on supporting
Reagan's terrorist wars in Nicaragua the
there were official pretexts but there
were so thin that they were refuted
instantly I won't insult your
intelligence by going through it the
invasion killed several thousand poor
people according to Panamanian Human
Rights investigators there are no
official US sources we don't do body
counts as general commie franks the
Conqueror of Iraq explained the invasion
reinstated the rule of us spanked us
back bankers and narco-traffickers fact
arco trafficking went way up it's
commemorated by a day of mourning in
panama it was hardly more than a
footnote to history but it did have some
new features one of them was explained
by former State Department official
Elliott Abrams returned since he pointed
out that this was the first time the
United States had been able to intervene
without concern for a Russian reaction
somewhere in the world and other
prominent commentators elaborated they
pointed out that with the Soviet
aren't gone the US would be free to
resort resort more readily to force the
violence and subversion to achieve its
global aims another novelty was that the
invasion of Panama could not appeal
reflexively to the communist threat it's
a couple of weeks after the fall of the
Berlin Wall so a new pretext was needed
and it was quickly supplied it was the
threat of Hispanic narco-traffickers
seeking to destroy the United States the
drug war had in fact been declared by
Richard Nixon for interesting reasons
that have to put aside but it took on a
new a new role as the unipolar moment
dawn and similar considerations guided
the general formulation of policy after
the collapse of the monolithic and
ruthless conspiracy aiming for world
conquest borrowing john f kennedy's
phrase within months of wash after the
fall of the wool washington outlined its
new course in brief everything will stay
very much the same but with new pre
takes so we still need a huge military
system but for a new reason the
technological sophistication of third
world powers nobody left you know the
independence of the Intelligencia we
still have to maintain what they called
the defense industrial base that's a
euphemism for high-tech industry we're
not allowed to concede that would be
very far from a free market economy the
high-tech economy relies very heavily on
the dynamic state sector much of it
under Pentagon cover we must maintain
intervention forces directed at the
Middle East energy regions where the
unquoted where the significant threats
to our interests could not be laid at
the Kremlin's door that's contrary to
days of deceit no apology all of this
and much more like it was passed over
quietly and barely even reported but for
those who hope to understand something
of the world it's pretty instructive as
a pretext for inter intervention the war
on drugs was far too narrow a more
sweeping mission was needed and the
intellectual community quickly turned to
the task they declared what was called a
normative revolution that granted the US
the right of humanitarian intervention
as it shows for the noblest of reasons
but that's by definition the traditional
victims were unimpressed to put it
mildly conferences of leaders of the
global South immediately and bitterly
condemned what they called the so-called
the so-called right of humanitarian
intervention their stand was upheld by a
high-level UN panel in 2004 in this case
with leading us figures participating
among them former National Security
Advisor Brent Scowcroft and the
distinguished Australian diplomat Gareth
Evans a refinement was therefore
necessary and again the intellectual
classes rose to the occasion of devising
a new doctrine responsibility to protect
its familiarly known as r2p it's now the
topic of a substantial literature many
conferences new organizations academic
journals and much praise and the praise
is in fact justified at least in one
respect we may recall a Gandhi's
response to the question of what he
thought about Western civilization he's
alleged to have said that it would be a
good idea
and the same holds of r2p there would be
a good idea on that I think everyone
should agree but then the usual problems
arise just what is r2p and when does it
apply well on first question what is art
to pee there are two versions which are
commonly in fact systematically
conflated and west but they're quite
different one was given formal
expression at the United Nations World
Summit in 2005 and a radically different
position is articulated in the founding
document of r2p that's the report of an
international commission in 2001 of
which the leading figure and
spokesperson is Gareth Evans the World
Summit UN World Summit it basically
reiterated positions already adopted and
in fact implemented by the United
Nations at most with a sharper focus the
summit in particular adopted the
persistent unchanging stand of the World
Court the global South the high-level UN
panel namely the stand that forceful
action can only be carried out under
Security Council authorization with an
exception that's irrelevant although it
did grant the African Union a qualified
right of intervention within the African
Union itself now if that exception were
generalized the consequences would be
intriguing for example Latin American
countries would be authorized to carry
out large-scale terror in the United
States to protect victims of the u.s.
violence in the hemisphere well the
conclusion is immediate but never drawn
for some odd reason any event we can put
the African Union exception aside
although it is commonly adduced by
proponents of r2p to try to show that
it's an it's not an instrument of
imperialism but rather
is rooted in the south as it is in the
world summit version of r2p well that's
one version the second version of r2p
and the Evans report differs
fundamentally from the summit
declaration and it's crucial paragraph
the Commission authorizes action within
area of jurisdiction by regional or
sub-regional organizations subject to
their seeking subsequent authority from
from the Security Council this is 2001
and the paragraph was plainly crafted to
apply retrospectively to the bombing of
Serbia just what was forcefully rejected
by the global south the high-level panel
and the World Summit version of r2p this
provision of the Evans Commission
effectively authorizes the powerful to
use force at will and the reason is
quite clear the powerful unilaterally
determine their own area of jurisdiction
the Organization of American States and
the African Union they can't do that but
NATO can and does NATO determined that
its area of jurisdiction includes the
Balkans but interestingly not NATO
itself where shocking crimes were
committed against Kurds and southeastern
Turkey right through the 1990s that's
all off the agenda because of the
decisive military support for them by
the leader of the free world Bill
Clinton NATO later determined that its
jurisdiction extends to Afghanistan as
you know and also beyond officially it
now extends to protection of pipelines
sea routes and other crucial
infrastructure of energy systems on
which the West relies now these
expansive rights granted by the Evans
Commission are in practice
stricted to NATO alone radically
violating the principles of the world
summit and they explicitly opened the
door for resort the r2p as a weapon of
Imperial intervention at will well let's
turn to the second question how is r2p
applied in practice the answer will
surprise no one who has the slightest
familiarity with history or elementary
understanding of the structure of power
I'm not going to run through the highly
selective application it's exactly as it
expect I but just take a few examples
there's no thought of the voting pennies
to protect the huge numbers of people
dying from hunger and lack of health
care that's at a level far beyond root
far higher than Rwanda probably twice
the Rwanda level among children alone
and not for a hundred days but every day
and increasing victims who are protected
populations by law protected populations
are also barred from protection among
them the victims of the us-israeli
attack in gaza early this year they are
protected persons under the Geneva
Conventions but they are not part of the
responsibility to protect victims who
are the direct responsibility of the
Security Council also are unable to
appeal to r2p striking cases Iraqis
subjected to Clinton's murderous
sanctions which were condemned as
genocide ille by the administrators of
the UN programs the respected
international diplomats Dennis how are
they and Huntsman spawning who
successively resigned in protest against
these violations of the Genocide
Convention so they're not protected also
not protected are the victims of the
worst massacres of recent years in the
eastern Congo and only the cynical might
suspect that the neglect has something
to do with the fact
the worst offender is you SLI Rwanda and
that multinationals are making a mint
from robbing the region's rich mineral
resources with the crucial aid of the
militias that are tearing the place to
shreds anyone who has a cell phone as a
beneficiary and on and on exactly as the
rationale would suspect well returning
to the dawn of the unipolar moment after
the fall of the wall another question
that came to the fore right away was the
fate of NATO now its traditional
justification had been defense against
the Russian hordes so with the USSR gone
pretext evaporated naive souls who had
faith and prevailing doctrine and
believed what they were taught in school
would have expected NATO to disappear as
well quite the contrary the NATO quickly
was expanded to the east in violation of
pledges to Gorbachev and as I just
mentioned that since been expanded well
beyond to a global intervention force
under US command 1mo motive very likely
we don't have internal documents but
very likely that one in took one motive
is to prevent Europe from pursuing an
independent course and perhaps alone
goalless lines that's been a primary
concern of us planners since World War
two more generally policies during the
unipolar moment and up to the present
have kept very closely to the guidelines
that were devised by FDR's planners
during World War two they recognized
that the United States would emerge as
the dominant global power displacing
Britain and accordingly they developed
plans for the United States to exercise
control over a substantial portion of
the globe this grand area as they called
it was to comprise at a
the Western Hemisphere the former
British Empire and the Far East and in
the Grand area quoting them now the US
would hold unquestioned power and would
act to ensure the limitation of any
exercise of sovereignty by states that
might interfere with its military and
economic supremacy that's roseville note
the similarity to the Bush Doctrine that
outraged articulate opinion 60 years
later and review of the intervening
period reveals that the same doctrines
prevailed and in fact still do a good
illustration is wishes immediate
predecessor Bill Clinton regarded as a
centrist modder pretty much Obama's
model under Clinton the US officially
reserved the right to act unilaterally
when necessary including unilateral use
of military power to ensure uninhibited
access to key markets energy supplies
and strategic resources that's without
even the pretexts of self defense on
which the bush neo-cons insisted the
Clinton doctrine elicited no
condemnation or maybe even comment
unlike the arrogant and contemptuous
proclamations of the Bush administration
and rightly because it just reiterated
long-standing positions and it was
presented with polite restraint in the
early days of World War two rows
planners thought that Germany might
prevail in Europe but as Russia ground
down the ver moch the division became
more expansive the grand area was to
incorporate as much of Eurasia as
possible at least Western Europe
economics economic heartland detailed
plans were developed for World Order and
they were soon implemented right
to the war each region was assigned what
was called its function in the u.s.
dominated global system so for example
Southeast Asia was to fulfill its major
function as a source of raw materials
for Japan and Western Europe under the
u.s. Aegis the South in general was
assigned a service rule it it was to
provide resources cheap labor markets
investment opportunities more recently
other services such as export of
pollution and waste so what's happening
in Somalia right now at the time of the
u.s. was not much interested in Africa
so Africa was handed over to Europe to
exploit word that was used for its
reconstruction from wartime destruction
that happens to be George cannons phrase
one can imagine different relations
between Europe and Africa in the light
of history but these were not considered
the wily the Imperial culture in
contrast to Africa the Middle East oil
reserves were recognized to be a
stupendous source of strategic powers
and one of the greatest material prizes
in world history it was the most
strategically important area in the
world and Eisenhower's words control of
Middle East oil would provide the United
States with substantial control of the
world top democratic planners recognized
and those principles remain in force
with regard to Latin America post war
planners concluded that the primary
threat to us interests is posed by
radical and nationalistic regimes that
appeal to the masses of the population
and seek to satisfy the popular demand
for immediate improvement in the low
living standards of the masses and
development for domestic needs and these
tendencies conflict with the requirement
of a political and economic climate
conducive to private investment with
adequate
creation of profits and protection of
our raw materials hair so God happened
to place them somewhere else mysteries
of providential ISM and a large later on
it wasn't just radical and nationalist
regimes but also this heresy of the
effort to revive Christianity pre-roman
Christianity and a large part of
subsequent history that flows from these
conceptions a support for harsh
dictatorships proceeds unchanged as
President Obama said off to deliver his
highly praised Cairo speech he hastened
to explain that he did not regard
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as an
authoritarian leader in his words I tend
not to use labels for folks when a
political leader uses the word folks you
know you're going to shudder at what
comes next Obama obliged he praised
Egypt's brutal dictator as a force for
stability and good in the Middle East
just as in the past support for
democracy and for human rights keeps to
the pattern that scholarship has
repeatedly discovered standards
schizophrenia correlating very closely
with strategic and economic objectives
it's small wonder that outside the West
very few take us charges against Iran
very seriously and not only the alleged
concerns for Human Rights which doesn't
reach the left meter but also the
primary charges that Iran is concealing
something from the International Atomic
Energy Agency as it doubtless is others
are concealing nothing at all for
example the three countries that have
never signed the non-proliferation
treaty India Pakistan and Israel all of
which have relied on the United States
on us port for their nuclear weapons
programs
at the peak of the recent furor about
Iran India announced that quoting it can
now build nuclear weapons with the same
destructive power as those in the
Arsenal's of the world's major nuclear
powers which means Pakistan will try
week lead imagine at the same time the
International Atomic Energy Agency
passed a resolution calling on Israel to
join the non-proliferation treaty and to
open up its nuclear facilities to
inspection well the US and Europe tried
to block the resolution and when they
failed they voted against it it passed
anyway and President Obama hastened to
assure Israel that the US would support
its rejection of the resolution the
White House also assured its Indian a
lie that it can ignore Security Council
resolutions on nuclear weapons that
crucially the most recent one a
resolution a teenage seven on September
24th that resolution may recall was
hailed as a great victory for obama and
his conflict with Iran but if he bother
to read it it's short find on the
internet said nothing about it ran it
was directed against the United States
Israel event India Obama reacted to
resolution 1887 not only by telling
India that they can ignore it but also
in a different way two days after he was
awarded the nobel peace prize for his
inspiring commitment to peace the
Pentagon announced that it was
accelerating the livery of the most
lethal weapons in the arsenal as short
of nuclear weapons these are 13-ton
kiloton bombs to be delivered by a b-52
stealth bombers they're designed to
destroy deeply hidden bunkers shielded
by 10,000 pounds of reinforced concrete
and there's no secret about what they're
for planning for these
massive ordnance penetrator zaz they're
called began in the bush years but
languished until Obama came into office
and rapidly called for developed
accelerating the development which is
now happening have been accelerated by
several years and are supposedly coming
into the Arsenal very soon well these
comments barely scratched the surface of
the formation and implementation of
policy during the unipolar moment but I
think their characteristic one
significant element is the continuity of
planning and interpret and and
interpretation since World War two when
the United States shouldered the
responsibility that was eloquently
described by Winston Churchill the
responsibility to protect the interests
of the satisfied nations whose power
places us above the rest the rich men
dwelling in peace within their
habitations to whom the government of
the world must be entrusted now under
Washington's guiding hand and that
remains the operative meaning of the
fashionable parade is responsibility to
protect
