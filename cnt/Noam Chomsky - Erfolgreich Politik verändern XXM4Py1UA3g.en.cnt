[Music] 
this interview with professor noam chomsky was conducted on october 28, 2009 10 in 
added to his office at the university of arizona in tucson 
the interview is thomas professional chance that you have had for 70 years 
politics analyzes and tries to change you if you get to this time 
Look back on what you consider to be your key advances and 
failure 
I assume a success that I never expected is related to 
the worst slaughter since the second, relative to the size of the population 
world war one indonesian invasion of east timor the slaughter was by the usa 
strongly supported the western powers and could have ended at any time 
our engagement seemed completely hopeless to some mostly young 
people organized themselves after 25 years it was finally possible enough 
to put pressure on the usa so that the president did what he did all these years 
could have already done the thing to call off 
But that was only after almost a third of the population had been destroyed 
one of the most one-sided conflicts i can imagine a tiny one 
country with 600,000 people that defends itself against a great power, indonesia the 
Supported by the usa and the european powers was finally successful 
That was an unexpected success. Failures too many to list 
almost everything fails in some way so i have a lot of time and 
effort in opposition to the indochina wars the usa does not invest in 
resistance involved and risking a long prison sentence according to many 
years ago there was finally some kind of agreement but only when the federal states 
were practically ruined from which they never recovered 
so that was only partially successful and essentially a 
failure there are many other initiatives that could have been successful 
But they can almost completely fail like trying some rights for the 
Preserve the Palestinian population under Israeli occupation 
that really didn't work and it shouldn't be difficult 
to achieve this it has been known for many years what the solution is 
but there is no way to do this, especially the usa 
bring the necessary steps 
however, there has been a lot of progress at home 
the civil rights movement had some successes 
They were limited but important to the women's movements in which I personally 
Was not particularly involved, the environmental protection had considerable success 
Movements have moved from nothing to significant other 
mobilizations are partial success i was closely involved in the resistance 
Against Reagan's terrorist wars in Central America this was resistance 
not only strong but also unique in history 
It was the first time in the history of imperialism that citizens of the 
imperial power not only protested, which is rare enough, but 
actually relocated to the victims to try and help them 
to grant them protection against state terror the one white 
face, perhaps, would like to offer thousands of normal us citizens too 
Protestant parishes in rural regions took part 
intensely difficult to say whether that was a success or not 
a few hundred thousand people were killed 
countries have been destroyed and are still not functional even today 
Still, it wasn't like Vietnam the government was prevented from doing that 
do what john f kennedy and lyndon johnson did without domestic protests 
chemical attacks to destroy crops and livestock large-scale ethnic 
purges forced admission to concentration camps b52 bombings 
densely populated areas none of that was found in central america 
would have been done but I mean if the protests hadn't happened 
you can actually say the same thing about the war in iraq, that war in that 
I also got involved was the first time in the history of 
imperialism that there are massive protests against a larger war of aggression 
existed even before it had officially started 
Nevertheless, the city he found was awful enough to have many followers 
isis and others nevertheless also here the bush government and its successors 
had no way to do what the us government had done for years and without 
sanctions in indochina could have done what can I say in summary 
can certainly not refer to anything that you can call a complete success 
There could be parts of successes and there are many strokes where you can find what you call 
feasible hoped for not made it I would like to dig a little deeper into that 
get in what you can learn from successes and failures 
over the past 70 years we have undoubtedly seen some improvements 
as you said, however, the living conditions are in 
in many ways terrible with a lot of poverty with a lot of ecological destruction 
our planet with violent conflicts the millions of 
refugees generate with threats from weapons of mass destruction and 
other dangerous technologies in the context of a system strong 
rival states and increasing inequality democracy is decomposing into 
Politics and business as corruption widespread facilitated by a 
huge network of tax havens, mailbox companies and corrupt lawyer 
accountants bank managers and financial advisors given this and 
Of course, we have a practical reason to be optimistic about other problems 
being and telling each other that a better world is possible if only we 
work hard enough for it 
But if you are not an experienced man then from this point of view 
consider human affairs observer like 
then probably a further future for humanity appears to you like 
It is likely that humanity will ever do that to some extent 
to achieve the global political order that we strive for and that will justly achieve 
to consider something possible 
here we actually have to ask another question as to how probable it is 
it is that humanity has a bright or dark future 
we have to realize that for the first time in human history 
the survival of organized human society within us 
known form of decisions depends on the next couple of years 
to be hit 
the environmental crisis is extremely serious a few weeks ago i read one 
Article by one of the heads of the pwc report and pallet on atomic 
scientists of the most important journal on all these topics in which he so 
let's talk plainly about the time for 
panic has come, we have run out of time 
we still have a few years to solve these problems 
after that it is over look at the other major threat that has existed since 75 
years over our heads hovers since 6 august 1945 a day i never 
will be forgotten 
Given the facts, it's a miracle that we survived 
unfortunately, these facts are largely unknown to the former us 
defense minister william perry recently said he was very scared 
double fear of the extent of the danger and brown 
second, because you have almost no attention 
Kyte is devoted to a third reason for such a fear 
to lead namely that those who understand very well what they are doing 
Let the risk escalate consciously up to and including a major catastrophe, for example 
what happened for a couple of weeks the trump administration celebrated 
hiroshima day by leaving the intermediate range nuklear service gns 
treaty the gorbachev rain treaty for 20 years a minimum of peace 
and had guaranteed stability 
Short-range missiles in Europe could easily trigger a massive nuclear war 
last war trigger the rake in administration was under pressure 
here i come back to your earlier question through broad mobilization of the 
population and activism which were the basis for their steps in 
towards disarmament the trump administration has this disarmament 
dismantled and terrorists almost begged to do the same 
immediately after withdrawing from the contract, the pentagon tested a missile 
the test had obviously been prepared for a long time 
a clear breach of contract gave the arms industry the green light 
She was ecstatically immensely for developing new exotic 
Weapon systems supersonic missiles against which there is no possibility of defense 
give them a cheer and are already thinking about the other orders 
which you will get to invent defensive measures against the systems 
that they are developing now we can be sure that the russians 
others will probably do the same thing, too, that makes total destruction significant 
So probably going beyond perry, we have three reasons for the greatest 
first concern the increasing threat 2 die 
Almost complete lack of attention to the threat, thirdly, the very conscious 
conscious escalation of the threat from people who know exactly what they are doing 
the same goes for the environmental disaster the danger is very real finite 
a certain amount of protest develops, especially from young people 
But the people who understand exactly what they are doing hurry the danger further 
to stir up a familiar and well researched it 
example is exxon mobile which ex and scientists were in the 60s and 
70s leader in the study of global warming and its 
disastrous impact and they captured the best work on this 
topic these naturally went to the management and they reacted 
finally in the late 80s as the subject mainly by james 
henson's famous speech was made public in 1988 
By investing money in denial you are not concrete denial 
did not want to say straight away refuted facts but rather the refined strategy 
of the doubt how should we know that we have 
the clouds denser not examined 
Here you can also appeal to economists of whom there are many in 
all parts of the world who tell us that it is best to do business first 
The richer societies will grow the 
then put things in order 
that is reminiscent of the joke of a man who fielded the roof of a skyscraper and 
shouted to his friend on the fiftieth floor that everything is going wonderfully and always 
That was the attitude of economics that worked well 
largely the us government, especially under trump, is the ore 
not even criminals in human history in the truest sense of the word 
Hitler strove to destroy organized human beings 
living together but that's exactly what they do to you know it 
about a year ago, for example, one of trom's authorities published 
the national highway traffic safety administration tsa 
one of the most amazing official documents in the history of the 
humanity this very careful and detailed 
500 page environmental assessment predicted that by the end of the 
millennium the temperature would rise by 4 degrees Celsius 
this is a rise in temperature that the world bank describes as catastrophic 
and is considered by scientists to be twice that of what would be compatible 
with the hope of maintaining organized human coexistence 
after reaching that conclusion, they recommended a decision 
we shouldn't do anything to reduce car emissions 
ok and the argument is quite valid it will all be over soon anyway 
So let's have fun and so much from the few remaining years 
getting as profitable as possible has something like that in human history 
once given only partially 
here we come back to the threefold fear of what the nsa predicts 
terrible the reaction was practically zero 
a few articles in the press and then forgotten 
and those who know what they are doing are working flat out and doing exactly that 
Take the big banks JP Morgan for example 
chase the greatest her chief executive jamie diamond knows 
everything we know about global warming 
He is an educated person and how does he react by putting more money into the 
Fossil fuel exploitation point including the most dangerous 
fuels like canadian tar sand knowing exactly what that means 
I wouldn't be surprised if he did 
privately, however, the sierra club supports its institutional role 
advocated racing towards the disaster because it would cause it 
make profits 
exxon mobile has actually announced that its business strategy will be based on it 
aims to maximize no money on sustainable fossil fuels 
Wasting energy yourself and profitably if less profitable 
is so mad she continues forward everywhere now that is part of the world 
the other part of the world is made up of 
organizations like extension rebellion sunrise moment small groups of young people 
people who have achieved something spectacular with their protests and also 
try to make progress on climate change 
they sat in the offices of congressmen and became 
supported by some of the young women who were recently elected to 
the wave of sender's movement especially alexandria casio cortez and succeeded 
to put a green new deal on the legislative agenda 
a green new deal in some form is a prerequisite for survival 
two years ago people just laughed about it when they heard about it today 
if it is on the legislative agenda there are plans to move it forward 
maybe not in this form but certainly in some form 
progress and there are these two rival forces 
they look very unequal, as in the case of east timor on one side 
we young people who want to survive on the other are the most important 
institutions of society that put more money in their over-full pockets 
want no matter whether humanity survives or 
not that in essence, the conflict is a very unequal one, but the same applies 
maybe even more for the nuclear weapons topic because it is currently only completely 
weak popular movements there in the early 80s they were still huge 
but since then they have shrunk and largely unknown few know about it 
treaty or its meaning the united states has claimed that it has withdrawn from the 
dropped out of the contract because the russians had injured him 
That is reported everywhere, it is not reported that the Russians since 
years ago claim that the united states violated their claims 
American experts take the ballets on atomic seriously 
scientists recently brought in from a leading american expert 
on this subject photo postl an editorial of the russian claims 
described and classified as quite credible 
the missile defense positions right on the russian border are already now 
a threat you were there with the ridiculous 
justification placed Europe must be against non-existent Iranian missiles 
defend you can't even laugh anymore 
It is widely accepted that anti-missile defense missiles are anti ballistic 
Missiles are not defensive weapons, they are only intended for firearms 
you can't make a heartbeat but you can 
Intercept a retaliatory strike against a first strike 
in this respect, they are essentially firearms directly on the russian 
limit post analysis shows that such missiles are both offensive and offensive 
Can be used defensively you can easily attack weapons 
as the latest rocket test confirms the technology will be modified 
which was used in this test in august and the violation of the eu 
contract is largely the same as the one in the missile defense system here 
two great powers each arguing that the other is one 
I violated an important contract, it is obvious what is in a reasonable 
world would happen both sides would negotiate 
and hire an external independent expert to do so 
finding the facts and solving the problem this is not our world 
In our crazy world they tear up the contract and are still trying 
develop destructive weapons without attracting attention 
this is our world and here we are unfortunately back to the second and third 
reason to be afraid to have little attention and the involved lawn 
consciously forward also those who are somewhat respected such as 
the matches who withdrew from the tramp administration because he 
whose politics could no longer bear and the fas with awe than the 
only serious adult is considered it was the new one 
actually hatched a national security strategy 
is insane 
According to her, the usa should prepare for two atomic wars 
to win against china and russia at the same time is more than insane 
The outbreak of a single nuclear war would all result in one 
nuclear winters also die those who hit the first strike 
the search for means had carried out the world 50 
fold to destroy you don't know what to say about it 
and he jim matthes is respected now that's the problem on 
institutional level on the human level we have 
popular movements mostly young people but not so much in relation to 
the subject of atomic war and if you turn to the problems that is 
interesting as you know the buletten on atomic scientists has one 
nuclear war clock that you set anew every year 
last year they put it closer to midnight than ever before 
24 12 what you call the new abnormal and you have new reasons for it 
Added earlier it was of course the nuclear threat in younger years 
the ecological but this time they added a third reason for decay and 
destruction of democratic forums that sounds different but makes sense 
Democratic forums are the only way to address the first two problems 
to cope with when these forums fall apart you have especially on the 
collapse of the messaging systems pointed to the inundation of these 
intentional false reporting systems 
this is a totally totalitarian tactic the messaging system with so many lies about 
flood that people don't even know if there is one at all 
there is a difference between true and false so one eliminates the possibility 
rational and well discussed through collective decisions with which one 
Could address the pressing problems that is a pertinent one 
tactics for those who want to maximize profit and power who don't care about the future 
and who are willing to destroy democratic forums 
that is really an outgrowth of the neoliberal politics before one 
Generation has been introduced by rainy weather to pretty much everyone since then 
there was no need to be a genius and predict exactly what happened 
that there would be a high concentration of assets 
at the moment it looks like this in the usa now 0.1 
percent of the population own more than 20 percent of private wealth and 
the poorer half has - wealth that is a direct consequence of that 
politics most extreme in the usa for various reasons but it happens 
stagnation everywhere for the majority democracy decline is almost direct 
follow the concentration of wealth that already dominates politics 
In particular, the reduction in social benefits naturally leads to people 
courage present in the ear and feeling contempt for the institutions that sees 
at every election the parties of the middle break a that 
is a very fertile field for demagogues who can try 
mobilize frustrated and angry populations 
By not paying attention to the root causes of the problem that one lets 
rather set aside but on scapegoats at people who still 
are more vulnerable than they are to immigrants, Muslims, blacks and such 
further that is a very dangerous constellation of the same kind as 
of those who led to the horrors of fascism they said I had 
I've been involved in politics for seventy years, in reality it was 80 
I wrote my first article in 1939 about the spread of fascism 
at that time unstoppable there was no very deep conception of one 
ten year old but it was pretty obvious what was going on 
that was immediately after the fall of barcelona of the spanish republic 
ended Austria and Czechoslovakia were captured 
looked like there was no end and we're kind of back 
trump is far from hitler 
he has neither its ideology nor its goals but if you have his 
Rallies listen off the childhood memories of radio broadcasts 
from hitler's party rallies at which i didn't understand the words but nevertheless 
the emotions the passion it was scary to experience that again 
I think that we are also closely involved in politics and economics in this area 
are linked to each other and enter a danger zone 
Fortunately, there is resistance here too in the usa had bernie 
sanders and the movements he co-founded had a big impact 
the population now wants at least to be traditionally social democratic 
skip new deal policy what a big change would be such a big one 
Progress would undermine much of what is going on and 
the same goes for europe - it will be a long battle on almost every front 
there is this kind of confrontation it is not the first time this is im 
basically a class struggle that goes far back in history 
many other constellations he has just one special 
threatening character adopted because of the problems we faced 
are enormous are what cannot be overestimated it is literal 
the case that the current generation must determine whether 
organized human society will continue to exist 
it's about nothing less than that 
will we be able to stop this 
back to my prediction as a ten year old for me be it for that 
unstoppable at the time, of course I didn't know then but the us 
government had more or less the same impression 
we didn't know then we know today that the foreign ministry and 
the council on foreign relations that is a non-state predominantly 
cooperative association that deals with foreign policy issues that 
these two had founded a working group in 1939 called the wall and 
peace studies group to prepare for the post-war period 
There are very detailed studies on this available today. In 1939 they assumed this 
that the usa would emerge from the war very powerful and victorious that 
was out of the question 
But it was also assumed that another great power would be the Germans 
that would be the world of a us-led region and a german one 
even as a small child with very limited 
Knowing had roughly the same assumption then there was the us 
Zone of influence as they called the basic imperative, of course, the whole 
the american continent would belong to it like that of the usa 
taking over former british empires including the middle east and then 
nor asia the germans would rule the rest of the eurasian region 
assessment remained in place until 1943 until stalingrad and the giant 
Tank battle of course which made it quite clear that the Russians were the 
Germans would defeat the Americans and the British rather than each other 
would keep aside the way it came to be 
At that time they changed to a new assessment about it would still be 
two worlds are now but with another enemy they actually thought 
british churchill in particular is already thinking about how we wage war 
Organize against Russia Churchill had an incredible plan 
which came from the british military start and provided for an attempt by the wehrmacht and 
to set aside german industry for an immediate war against russia 
when the war was over, this plan was likely abandoned by 
roosevelt, however, that's how people thought at the time and then came the post-war period 
plans of the in peace studies group were later drawn up in the planning office of 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and for many years also largely 
implemented that leads us directly into the post-war world and that's how it went 
next [music] 
When the Soviet Union collapsed there was the illusion that we were now in a time of 
would enjoy peace with peace dividend shortening the pentagon 
etats and so on who would have bothered the public documents 
I would not have believed for a minute as soon as the Soviet Union had seen this 
collapsed, the Bush Administration released the first bus 
first a new defense budget and a new one 
security plan 
they are extremely interesting but no one lets them public 
Accessible Your core message was that we do 
The military budget has to be maintained roughly as before, even without the Russians 
and the reason for that is i don't feel that 
technological sophistication of the third world powers that is why we need it 
huge machine that can blow up the whole world in five minutes 
someone laughed nobody even looked 
then it said that we would wage wars but now against much weaker ones 
enemies we must quickly and decisively 
otherwise it will harm us 
they re-examine the middle east as the main focus of the us reaction forces 
the hangover doctrine or even before and it was said that we were on the 
Middle East-facing reaction forces would have to maintain 
Then came this interesting turn where threats in our interests are not 
can be attributed to the kremlin in other words sorry people we have 
lied to you for 50 years, it wasn't the russians who threatened us 
they call radical nationalism independent nationalism of themselves 
does not adapt to our goals for that we need those reaction forces 
that was of course always the real reason, but for the whole 60 years 
before that, reference was always made to the russian threat 
okay, we made a mistake there you can't take responsibility 
to write in the kremlin if there is no longer a kremlin we still have to 
Carry on as before and it went almost exactly the same 
a few weeks after the fall of the berlin wall, the usa invaded panama 
it was about kidnapping a guy who was actually a criminal 
but one that the usa had brought to power noriega they have 
he also supported him through fake elections 
but he made a mistake he started to refuse to take orders 
we don't go after all we are the mafia if that 
ignoring orders makes him a head shorter 
so they sent troops to panama kidnapped them presented to them 
American courts and so on settle un decisions with veto 
away you bothered 
a few months later on august 2, 1990, saddam hussein fell kuwait 
he actually had reason to 
Allegation that Kuwait had stolen Iraqi oil that Iraq had 
Arab world in a long battle against Iran now defended robbed 
They admitted Iraqi oil to no justification for an invasion though 
a much more serious argument than in the panama case during the invasion 
According to human rights watch, around 800 people were killed, significantly fewer than in 
panama the usa is an opportunity 
now we can really demonstrate our power 
just a few weeks after the invasion, there was a lot of delusion 
about an impending invasion of saudi arabia and the takeover of oil 
fairy tales but within weeks after the attack it was clear that saddam 
had understood that he had made a mistake he offered under certain 
to negotiate terms of withdrawal 
all of this was known reported leaked from the foreign ministry 
the press wanted nothing to do with it 
i will tell you a personal story 
at the time i was pretty close to the editors at the austen club 
at that time it was the most liberal newspaper in the country 
since then she has almost disappeared i asked her if i could write an article about it 
rumors from the foreign ministry are allowed to publish it 
indicated that there might be a negotiated solution 
we were friends at the time, they said yes, but that won't work until after the attack 
the usa in fact published mine 
Article right after the January 1990 invasion 
that is right after the fall of the soviet union nothing has changed 
actually it has become even more extreme 
in el salvador there was an elite battalion everyday atl that of the usa 
trained and equipped had already committed many atrocities a few days 
after the fall of the berlin wall it had just returned from the usa 
where it had received additional training from us special forces 
The battalion on November 16, 1989 in the Jesuit university murdered six 
leading Latin American intellectual Jesuit priests as well 
also their housekeeper and daughter to make sure there are no witnesses 
it turned out to be this on 
Under the orders of the Salvadoran government, a government was passed 
and with whom the us embassy can be in close contact 
does anyone remember the names of the victims 
if that had happened in eastern europe there would have been massive protests 
but that we have six leading Latin American intellectuals 
jesuit priests murdered who knows 
that was a few days after the fall of the berlin wall 
nothing happened and this is not an isolated incident 
this crime ended the decade of the 1980's that had begun 
with the murder of an archbishop when he was celebrating a mass archbishop 
romero on march 4th 1980 the same murderers all with the support of the usa 
it is known that there were considerably smaller incidents in eastern europe 
huge headlines made when enemies did something 
pale when we do it there could be many cases of this kind 
enumerating let us consider dream recent betrayal 
the kurds in syria betrayal of the kurds is practically an official qualification in 
the usa each president one after the other 
ronald reagan, for example, was president as his friend saddam hussein of the die 
usa supported poison gas attacks against iraqi kurds in halabja and others 
major atrocities carried out how has the government reacted now to the congress 
tried to protest and rain vetoed 
rain and his government tried to attack iran over saddam hussein 
to protect later when they wanted to invade Iraq, they called it 
as a reason for the invasion, look at this terrible villain 
and so it goes on and on it is almost automatic 1939 you can 
I can still understand it, but since then it has continued the same way 
sometimes, for example, when the Soviet Union collapsed, there were slight ones 
strategy changes but nothing fundamentally new 
That's one side, on the other, you had powerful protest movements 
Movements against the war in China took many years to develop 
to develop and waited far too long a friend but in the end she became 
big enough to limit nixon's escalation efforts and 
likely to end 
now the time that remains for us is very limited as we said earlier 
we have little time left and we almost run out of time 
the destruction of indochina was bad enough but now it's about survival 
humanity 
that is now in our hands and that is a major scandal 
Leadership in this teenage fight falls to where the rest of us is greta 
thunberg okay a wonderful person but why a 16 year old child and 
do you know when she comes out in front of the un not everyone says with their head and knocks her 
done very nicely on the shoulder and then it goes 
Just as before, the question of how optimistic you are 
you that humanity can actually overcome these problems or 
will overcome 
Do you know that is really not the right question 
you have two options you can decide that everything is hopeless 
give up and thereby ensure that the worst will or can come 
try to take advantage of existing opportunities and there are such opportunities and dedicate themselves to them 
maybe it will create a better world that has always been 
alternative no matter what happens it's all pointless 
well then we come to the next question with everything that has been in the last 50 years 
Progressive politics have learned which council would they be next 
generation how can they be more successful than 
Your own generation should strive for a focused hearing 
showing the major political evils in a certain plausible order 
fights if so what is the main problem on the progressive 
political energies should be concentrated now 
I think there are dangers, there is always the tendency to do adventure that one 
the consequences of his actions do not think through but act because one 
thinks the problems are so dire that you just have to act 
Take, for example, the waterman towards the end of the vietnam war, nice young people 
people i knew many of them they were shocked by the war 
found it so terrible that they deemed it necessary on them 
main streets to march throw windows to attack banks and such 
further the vietnamese were shocked i remember meeting with 
vietnamese where they asked me to talk them out of what vietnamese wanted 
wild protests so mild that the peace movement laughed at them 
the vietnamese don't care what the americans felt 
They wanted to live and they understood that acting in the style of the 
Waterman would only step up support for the war 
maybe you feel better but we don't get killed 
this happens all the time and especially with young people it is natural to rain 
up and want to do something wild you have to use the tactics you want 
apply carefully think through the consequences 
the decision for a tactic is not trivial 
human followers depend on the tactics you know and you can do today 
There are many cases where this is not thought out carefully and appropriately 
The second thing to watch out for is infiltration 
We learned that very quickly in the anti-war movement of the 1960s 
Every group of government agents infiltrated it was not difficult 
to identify if someone is following hollywood version of a hippie 
was dressed and said let's get the people ready 
then you could be pretty sure that he would soon be in a lawsuit 
would show up and testify for the government 
however, we had to be careful when we did something tricky with 
human life was at stake such as the satire from the country 
smugglers did as always in groups of people 
who knew each other well because you never deal with government agents 
I was able to identify security such are always there, and I'm there today 
sure when protests become violent 
I immediately suspicious that was always a in the past 
Attempted official actors to increase the level of violence popular movements too 
discredit and build counter-movements 
they steer debates and discussions in the direction of violence where the powerful 
win you have to pay attention to these things 
a special thing is the so-called identity politics that is complete 
understandable these are important problems but they have to be coordinated with others 
people who have dedicated themselves to a certain topic will be 
Police brutality against black teenagers must be with others 
can work together to pursue other concerns 
this is sometimes called internationality you have to have shared purposes 
pursue and where necessary your own interests in favor of others 
can put back these are all pitfalls with every kind of 
activism occur one can cope with it 
more traps the government and establishment always ask us 
in the temptation to reduce political activism to all four 
years to vote and then back home 
check out the liberal media coverage of bernie sanders 
It is very clear that the hate the new york times published for example 
a few days ago an article about the establishment of the democratic party 
about the fact that they are not sure whether their candidates are really them 
correct ones are possibly hillary clinton 
or bring someone in and then you want to be the leading candidates of the 
democratic party by joe biden elizabeth warren the lot 
not one is missing 
that is hated and not because of his program but because he is a 
he violated an important taboo he organized a popular movement 
popular movement that focuses not only on elections but permanently 
is active such as those who have penetrated the congress and the 
have put the green new deal on the agenda 
the people should keep their hands off that sort of thing 
history of the formulation of the british civil war constitution 
to the british glorious revolution in the seventeenth century the mob like 
he is called has his place that is how spectators are not participants 
say the liberal democracy theory walter lippmann the founders of the 
modern political science etc. you know your role you are not to 
govern there that is our job 
it is very important to break this division of roles when 
if popular movements are to be effective, they must work continuously 
Of course you can take part in elections, but that's only a small one 
part of your job other activities are more important that is another 
Pitfall that you have to beware of otherwise meinrad is obvious 
there are existential problems that must be in the foreground 
as long as those are not resolved, everything else is insignificant if we are the danger 
do not ban or mitigate a nuclear war and also the danger of a 
environmental disaster then what else is unimportant 
happens because in a few decades it will all be over anyway 
so these problems must come first and then everything 
other [music] 
like the people who set the doomsday clock emphasized that too 
the decline of democratic structures and the collapse of the information systems 
a big problem this created a powerful one 
totalitarian instrument effective action to solve major problems 
blocks that is part of it 
the problem of massive inequality in europe where it is really extreme where the 
population political decisions were almost completely taken away 
everything is decided by an unelected bureaucracy in brussels 
today that is part of the structure of the european union 
no wonder that people are angry and upset 
if they are withdrawn, then there are the highly destructive ones 
austerity measures for which there is no serious economic justification 
societies broken still rich societies mind you through 
traditional social benefits provide some protection through them 
austerity measures are damaged in the usa because the worse 
social institutions are much weaker, we have to tackle all of these 
problems along with others like sexism misogyny hysterical migrants 
hate kids in concentration camps on the border not far from here tucson 
All of these things have to be tackled but they are all interrelated 
together influence each other where you get involved depends on the 
personal interests and concerns depending on what one 
addresses what one considers oneself suitable 
With such a commitment one must have the authorization parallel concerns in mind 
with whom you can hopefully work together 
no easy task and it's another scandal that they are teenagers 
the effect is obviously an important goal of consulting 
where can I do the most, but there are also other desiderato purposes 
does not always justify the means, one could say 
They also spent a lot of time on some kind of historical witness 
be by gathering information and evidence about it 
have what really happened to correct the official story 
even if that is no longer of any use to the victims in the case in question 
how could you weight these different desiderato at which 
you have set your political standards 
[Music] 
there are some almost trivial standards such as the large existential ones 
problems always have to be in the foreground 
but what you do as an individual depends on your personal characteristics 
what problems do you think you can achieve something 
maybe you can improve something in your neighborhood then do it 
that there is no general principle it can 
don't give my question concerns you personally how 
have you solved that is difficult to say why I have for example 
East Timor selected you know why because I hardly knew anything about it 
nothing was reported about it there were, as is so often the case, two or three young people 
PhD students in an east asia program the best at cornell university 
students of george pell a great southeast asia expert 
they learned of the situation in east timor and were appalled 
arno hahn was the main protagonist of the ten nobel prizes if she had 
something meant he was starting support for east timor too 
organize he contacted me and spoke about the topic at some meetings 
pursued it he is almost unknown but it is mainly his 
personal merit that it is finally over 
he purposely stayed in the background when I got involved when you were with 
even a little bit involved in such a thing you catch fire no matter what 
it's so dramatic they are 
you visit a poor village in southern colombia for hours, as I did 
away from the pan american i reach the village via a dirt road 
which leads past a small cemetery with wooden crosses where villagers 
US-backed paramilitary forces had been massacred 
I come to the village and talk to the people who try the mountain 
near your village prior to acquisition by canadian mining companies 
protect your agriculture would destroy your water supply etc. 
spend a few hours like this and the problem will no longer be 
let go 
The same goes for almost all such problems go downtown and 
spend time with homeless people wherever you look there are problems 
are so gripping and dramatic that you just have to get involved somehow 
if you decide you can't do everything so you try it 
to find out what is somehow important to you you already mentioned that 
inexorable rise in inequality in wealth they also said that such 
inequality democracy and any kind of political equality undermines how 
can we turn it back how can we come to a world it 
there are many possibilities that are not so mysterious, for example one 
property tax 
not like the ones in europe that didn't work there was too much avoidance 
but it works without aldi avoidance options that europe had built in 
that would be really feasible think i drew one and be it over we already 
languages   have very detailed plans for this 
that would make a difference if you could politically enforce it 
bring through the congress that depends on the strength of the 
People's movement from everything can be enforced if you have enough support 
from the population you have to win the congressmen for it no matter 
how much money is added ultimately you need votes 
So you can get through it but it won't be easy one 
financial transaction tax would make a lot of sense it would bring in a lot of money 
They would reduce activities in the financial sector which are destructive and 
It is predatory, for example, whether a trade is made a microsecond before the 
guy across the street can do 
All of the many things that have to do with taxes have been public opinion since 
years very pronounced for about 40 years there have been surveys in the usa 
Taxes essentially two questions were asked 
Do you think your taxes are too high? Everyone says yes 
Do you think the taxes for the rich are too low? Everyone says yes 
take a look at there are a few articles on this in politics 
scientific literature the media only report the first 
the taxes are considered excessive that is a very interesting result 
a measure of whether a democracy works in a functioning one 
democracy, people would celebrate the day they pay their taxes 
great this is the day we make decisions about what is in 
our society has to do and how much everyone should contribute to it 
these decisions are now being implemented 
we should celebrate the more taxes are rejected and feared 
the worse a democracy works 
they say there is no escape from death and taxes 
this shows that we do not live in a democracy 
that is a very simple criterion that people pay their taxes for 
hold inflated you can see that we have no trust in what with ours 
Tax money is made by the guys up there making decisions with them 
we have nothing to do they steal from us don't they 
we have to move towards a society in which we are happy about ours 
joint decisions about how our society should run effectively 
i want my schools to run well i want a park i want to go to the park 
Roads can drive great, we are very far from them 
Removing globalization naturally exacerbates that inequality problem 
Furthermore, different countries play their money off against each other 
move abroad and take on another citizenship 
that was the problem with the european wealth tax 
it was set up so that someone in france could pretend in luxembourg 
to live but it doesn't have to be, you can 
Restrict, for example, in the US system, theoretically, enforcement does 
it is not a US citizen regardless of 
Residence is taxed someone can still retain their citizenship 
give up but few are willing to do so just to save some money 
tax havens are set up by politics that is not a natural law 
they suck up trillions of dollars, by some estimates, around 20 trillion 
dollar apple computer is the largest company 
while their corporate headquarters are in ireland where they likely have an office in 
the size of mine and a typist doesn't have to be 
All of that could be changed, but there are certainly obstacles like that 
that we already talked about 
the exorbitant protectionist rules of the world trade organization 
radical anti free trade intellectual property rights strong 
stricter patent rights 
while such rules were part of the international system 200 years ago 
the usa would not be able to develop fish and fur exports 
there should be no such rules 
Supporters of both parties here in the usa protest against china because it fell 
intellectual property rights disregard the population should be happy whoever 
benefits from the fact that there are exorbitant patents on medicinal products, not that 
people who suffer from it the pharmaceutical companies are still generating 
excessive profits than would be the case under a reasonable system 
you have the thing under control you understand that it really is 
attack on china extremely interesting the central watchword is that china 
our jobs steals think a second about it keeps the 
Chinese government put a pistol on Apple's head, forcing it to 
investments or boeing or ibm no the people who take our jobs away 
are the bankers and investment managers in new york and chicago 
those who run these companies should we not criticize china many of these 
things are easy as soon as you make it clear everyone understands it 
one only has to remove this thin layer of misleading propaganda 
If the flowers have a clear view of the world then they can very well 
understand that you have many options for action 
well i think we have to come to a conclusion slowly 
I would like to thank you very much for giving us your time and answering 
With a little luck we can answer these questions on the day of the 
we will discuss the event further 
unfortunately I have to go to the next appointment, it's okay, thank you very much
