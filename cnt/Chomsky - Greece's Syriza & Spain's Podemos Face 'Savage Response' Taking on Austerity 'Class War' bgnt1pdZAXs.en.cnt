I wanted to ask you about syriza in
Greece a movement that started as a
grassroots movement now they have taken
power Prime Minister Alexis tsipras and
then you have Spain right now we
recently spoke to Pablo Iglesias the
secretary-general of the group called
podemos that was founded what an
anti-austerity party that has rapidly
gained popularity a month after
establishing itself last year they won
five seats in the European Parliament in
some polls show they could take the next
election which would mean that Pablo
Iglesias the 36 year old political
science professor and longtime activists
could possibly become the prime minister
of Europe's fifth largest economy he
came here to New York for just about 72
hours and I asked him to talk about what
austerity measures have met in Spain
austerity means that people is he says
bullshit of the homes austerity means
that the the social services don't work
anymore
austerity means that public schools have
not the elements the means to develop
the activity austerity means that the
countries have not sovereigns in anymore
and we became a colony of the financial
powers and economy of Germany austerity
probably means the ends of democracy I
think if we don't have democratic
control of economy we don't have
democracies impossible to separate
economy and democracy in my opinion that
was Pablo Iglesias the head of this new
anti-austerity group in Spain called
Polhemus which means in English we can
the significance of these movements is
very significant but notice the
reactions
the reaction to sir Issa was extremely
savage they made a little bit of
progress in their negotiations but not
much the Germans came down very hard on
them dealing with them and sort of
forced them to back off from almost all
their proposals what's going on with the
austerity is really class war as an
economic program austerity under
recession makes no sense it just makes
the situation worse so the Greek debt
relative to GDP has actually gone up
during the period of which is the
policies that are supposed to overcome
the debt in the case of Spain that was
not the public debt it was private that
it was the actions of the banks and that
means also the German banks remember
when a bank makes a dangerous risky
borrowing somebody's making a risky
lending and the policies that are
designed by the troika you know are
basically paying off the banks the
perpetrators much like you're the
population is suffering but one of the
things that's happening is that the you
know the Social Democratic policies
so-called welfare state is being eroded
that's class war it's not an economic
policy that makes any sense as to end a
serious recession and there is a
reaction to it Greece Spain and some in
Ireland that growing elsewhere France
but it's a very dangerous situation
could lead to a right-wing response very
very late time the alternative to Syria
might be gold dawn neo-nazi party
