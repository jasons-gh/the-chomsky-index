you're a caustic a critic of secrecy and
conspiratorial attitudes on the part of
governments but can you take us beyond
this negative appraisal and offer some
practical principles for reform in other
words is there a form of government at
which you believe is deserving of our
trust
i I think that's several different first
of all I don't accuse anybody of
conspiratorial behavior conspiracy is a
funny word you know it's used we don't
talk about it as conspiracy when we say
that the political men and decided to do
something that's not a conspiracy theory
that's just rational analysis the term
conspiracy is used to try to undercut
rational analysis of our own planning
system so there's nothing conspiratorial
about the fact that US planners decided
to do something that's their job you
know it's not conspiratorial they have a
commitment to keep the public from
knowing and that's understandable to in
fact to a substantial extent the media
have the same commitment I've documented
it quite substantially and it's fear of
democracy primarily it's what lies
behind it but why they're so but then
turn your point I mean are there
practical proposals is there a form of
government we can trust there are plenty
of practical proposals in fact I've been
talking about practical proposals in one
case and we can go case-by-case and find
lots of cases of practical proposals the
main they all ultimately rely on the
same thing people human beings you know
can figure out what their values are and
they're usually pretty much the same and
then they can ask how they can pressure
the various systems of authority in
which they live to act in accordance
with those principles now we're pretty
lucky you know these are free and
democratic societies so you can pressure
systems of authority without ending up
in a ditch cut to pieces and you know
after hideous torture so we're lucky you
know we have all sorts of ways of doing
uh
other people aren't so lucky to have
harder ways of doing it and they try and
you know it's astonishing that they do
more than we do under air
easy circumstances so let's say Georgia
- John Drew has a much harder time than
we do but he's outspoken you know the
when you talk when you ask is there a
form of government we can trust no by
definition there is no form of authority
that ever ordered oppressor
you don't cook and that ought to be
second nature
I mean you don't trust Authority what
you do is challenge authority you ask
authority to justify itself well maybe
sometimes they can justify itself if so
okay if it can't dismantling but
certainly don't trust it you know you
don't trust anybody but yourself
