I think with all the fancy talk and
international relations theory there's
only one principle that I know of it
seems to me to have any merit and that's
the Mafia principle International
Relations is very much like the Mafia
The Godfather does not accept
disobedience and for you know like if a
small stork it doesn't matter if it's an
important country or not so it suppose
some small storekeeper that doesn't pay
his protection money
well the Godfather doesn't just send out
his goons to pick up the money
sends out the goons to beat him to a
pulp so that others will understand this
obedience is not acceptable and we have
a rich documentary record I mentioned a
little of it but there's plenty more to
show that that's been a guiding
principle of great power politics
anywhere you look and it's an
understandable principle of course this
task of intellectuals and that's to
write editorials like the one I quoted
in The Boston Globe which is Universal I
don't want to dump on them
our noble efforts aren't working so
let's try something else but if you look
at the record that's the massive
principle
