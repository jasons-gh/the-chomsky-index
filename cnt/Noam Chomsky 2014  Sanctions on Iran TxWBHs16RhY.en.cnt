sanctions may be quickly sanctions well
I think we as in many of these cases we
should try to look at it from another
point of view imagine that Iran or Cuba
had the power to impose sanctions on the
United States should they do it they
certainly have plenty of justification
for it and I've mentioned a couple of
cases should they do it you know I
wouldn't I don't think that's the way
they should deal with these problems I
don't think it's the way we should and
we are much more culpable I mean we're
the ones who are carrying out attacks on
them I'm it takes a Iran the United
States in 1953 the United States
overthrew the parliamentary regime in
Iran imposed the harsh dictatorship from
that day until today there has literally
not been a day in which the US has not
been punishing Iran supported the Shah
harsh dictatorship up till 79
immediately turned to supporting Iraq's
attack on Iran which was murderous and
brutal u.s. supported all the way
through with such enthusiasm that it
denied the attacks on the Kurds
pretended that Iran had done them soon
as the war was over the u.s. is the Bush
administration invited Iraqi nuclear
engineers to the United States for
advanced training in nuclear weapons
production another threat against Iran
immediately sanctions were imposed on
Iran and then we come up to the prison
goes on literally not a day in which
Iran has not been subjected to pretty
harsh punishment by the United States
should they impose sanctions on us
I mean that it is conceivable well you
decide and I think that gives the answer
to that question
