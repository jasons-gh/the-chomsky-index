what sorts of things would drive you you
both are working so hard you're
activists you never stop reading and
writing you're passionately engaged in
the world and I wonder what's driving
you both what's what's motivating you
what's important to you connect you is
important looking in the mirror feeling
that in your life you've done all you
can do in trying to help you with the
problems of suffering people in our
society makes empathy short supply I'm
more shocked than other people in every
society the inability to picture what it
is like to be somebody else my
profession as a novelist I have to do
that I become other people but I always
have that tendency and I'm always
startled when I start to talk to people
start going on about how much they hate
the blacks or the Jew
gay people and you certainly see there
is no ability to identify with anyone
else except themselves and I suppose if
I had a motivating a thing I probably
would come out of an overwrought empathy
and irritability had its absence and
others
now in conversation gore Vidal and noam
chomsky I give you a little picture I
like to do little picture two years ago
what's the man in Paris 200th
anniversary and I'm there to talk about
it on television and all the Chiefs of
state from all the world are there and
the whole center of Paris is cordoned
off day after I'm trying to get out of
the hotel suddenly down the energy
streets to get out of it to see the
usual his son was possibly allegedly
going to prison for his S&L efforts the
cost of building out the S&L was
according to that radical paper in the
Wall Street Journal it will be slightly
more than the entire cost of world war
two to the United States in today's
dollars so there's a lot to divert
attention from that to me it was the
point to the war there obviously subtext
but that's the central one in my mind I
agree with you on that diversion there
are many audiences that had to be
addressed by this operation and one of
them is the American population who have
to be diverted not just from the SNL's
but from the whole growing social and
economic catastrophe around them which
has been very much accelerated in the
Reagan Bush years and in fact after all
this is not the first time they've been
periodic episodes of exactly this sort
right through the 1980s there's been
repeated huge propaganda effort
establishing some awesome chimera about
the destroy us and then we're
miraculously rescued at the last minute
international terrorists bomb Libya and
were saved narco traffickers and you
smash up Panama Mercedes and Grenada you
know hundred thousand people was set up
as a major threat to our existence with
an airfield you know I'm going to
interdict the sea traffic and the
Caribbean and so on and then we're saved
and so on and that's that standard I
mean you have to the way you want to
make sure that the population doesn't
think about what's around them and maybe
do something about it obviously that's
one audience but significant that's to
be taught a lesson
oh they have to be taught a lesson that
if you step on our toes you don't just
get beaten you get pulverized and in
fact the administration was kind enough
to give us that story in their own words
they leaked just as the ground and
so-called ground war where the growing
operation was beginning they leaked the
section of a national security review
policies very review from security
policy review from the early days of the
Bush administration so long before this
and it was a section on third-world
threats and what it said was something
like this it's that in the case of a
much weaker enemy it is not enough to
defeat them you have to defeat them
decisively and rapidly because anything
else would be too embarrassing and might
undercut political support so the trick
is you find a much weaker enemy build
enough to be a major monstrous force
menacing force that that was anything
some heat them or you know Noriega we've
done just year ago with Noriega defeat
them decisively in rapidly and that's
the only way to keep political support
and that's a lesson to the third world
but it's also a lesson to the world as a
whole I mean the United States no longer
is the the overwhelmingly dominant
economic force
world as it was for many years it's now
just one of three but in military force
it ranks supreme and it has every reason
to want confrontations in the world
shift it to the military arena because
the domain of force is where the United
States is dominant and you play your
strong card in any confrontation u.s.
card happens to be force furthermore
it's it's more intricate because the
u.s. no longer has the economic base to
carry out the traditional role of third
world intervention it therefore has to
become as the business Brett's has been
very frank and pointing out has to
become a mercenary State others are
gonna have to pay for these adventures
and one source of payment is petrol
dollars one of the major sources of
capital in the world is the profits from
energy production and the United States
wants to make sure as it has long wanted
to make sure that those profits are fed
primarily to support the US economy and
of course the economy of its weak tenant
in these operations namely written that
Saddam Hussein really is a bad guy but
he did do a terrible thing and invading
his neighboring country Kuwait but he
did subject the Kuwaiti people to
terrible tortures and that probably and
they also was probably building up a
nuclear arsenal but these were also in
many ways there was a justification for
this war but all those things are true
and they were all true on August 1st
all right on August 1st when the night
when it was true in 1980 in 1980 Saddam
Hussein was basically a Russian client
Reagan and Bush and Thatcher recognised
him as our kind of guy you know and they
worked very hard for several years to
switch him over to the US side on the in
1982 he was taken off the list of
terrorist state so that he could then
get huge US credits to buy US exports
became on a leading trade trigger the
u.s. became one of his leading trading
partners by 1987 Iraq was
Western depending on the West also for
the buildup of its extensive weapons of
mass destruction and so on when he did
things like they're gassing the Kurds in
1988 the Reagan administration intervene
to prevent Congress from condemning it
in any serious way belong to stop
sanctions this went right on to 1990 I
mean in July 1990 Bush intervened again
to try to prevent the House Foreign
Affairs Committee from condemning Saddam
Hussein or if they imposed some
sanctions that winter fear with American
business August 1st no while they were
getting warnings but direct statements
from the CIA saying the invasion was
coming new high technology shipments to
Iraq in the preceding two weeks up to
August 1st they authorized according to
let's make them make public so far and
there's the real story but what's been
made public so far they authorized
almost 5 million dollars worth of
high-technology aid Iraq it went not
just to Iraq it went to the Ministry of
military industry it went to the nuclear
research plant that was later bombed on
the grounds that it was producing
military bombs and to a chemical and to
another plant that was bombed on the
grounds that it was producing chemical
and biological weapons that was two
weeks before and it's true that the
invasion of Kuwait was a crime but you
know his record was so sordid that what
it was very slight and this makes no
sense
what's the turning point widening point
is a step on our toes I mean by the
standards of the United States Britain
you can guess your population you can
torture you can murder you can set up
one of the most brutal tyrannies in the
world that's all fine as long as you're
added but he did something on the second
which is impermissible
he was told we don't care very much if
you rectified border problems but he
took over quite and that's not allowed
we run the oil business and when anybody
steps on earth
especially if they're much weaker then
they get not only defeated but
pulverized that's the lesson that has to
be learned you speak of the lesson to
the second of third world countries even
more important apropos of my vision of a
nameless president drifting lost in
Paris ignored by other leaders this was
a message a lesson to the first world
not only over the Soviet Union off the
world stage as an empire what we are
doing we are we have no national at all
reason in the Middle East we have no
national interest we get 15% of our oil
comes from there and we could just as
easily get it from somewhere else but of
course Western Europe and Japan get most
of their oil from there I think I don't
believe that American administrations
are very good at planning or indeed
thinking and they don't generally rather
ignorant but I suspect that this is not
only a message to Western Europe that to
Japan that we are going to be a
permanent military presence in the
Middle East and that's where the oil
supply is and I can see it further down
the road we would absolutely collapse
economically if every quarter
the Japanese didn't come in buy American
Treasury bonds I could just see the Bank
of Japan dragging its feet or the
Buddhist Bank and the United States
clearing its threads and starting to
talk about oil prices and suddenly they
will start buying our Treasury bonds
I mean it's blackmail
they will start buying our Treasury box
I mean it's blackmail well I think
that's I'd like I don't entirely agree
with that I think there's another
faculty it's true that we don't use oil
very little oil from the Middle East and
as you say we could get by with none on
the other hand are the profits for
Middle East oil are a major not just the
oil is the profits made by the client
States they create a mint of the way
when Britain in the United States set up
the Imperial settlement for the region
the oil is the idea is goes back to Lord
Curzon that you set up with what Lord
Curzon called an Arab Asad and that then
Britain but later the United States
would rule would disguise absorption
behind the veil of Khan solution all
fictions like buffer state and so on
they have this ab facade which is
basically family dictatorships they
manage the oil system for us but they
but we make sure that we do have a lever
some of the some leverage over pricing
in production we want that to be in our
hands for exactly the reasons you
mentioned we also want to make sure that
the flow of investments of capital of
profits is largely back to the British
and American economies actually we have
documentary evidence than this the
documentary records been cleared
partially at least through through about
1960 and it's very interesting to look
at the Declassified British and American
records after the Iraqi Revolution in
1958 that was the first break in the
anglo-american condominium wasn't
naturally they were hysterical about it
and is all and Lloyd flew over
Washington and talk to Dulles and so on
so forth
and they decided at that time to regret
some kind of nominal independence to
wait to try to adapt in the threat of
another nationalist revolution there and
though they reserve the right
when Lori put it ruthlessly to intervene
if anything goes wrong with this
settlement and the reasoning was that at
that time particularly Britain they're
very concerned about that crazy
investments had to work late oil and
play the investments had to prop up this
topper in British economy and in fact
crop up still and go together
no by the 1970s the u.s. is in the same
position and it's not just the Japanese
who buy Treasury bonds the Saudi
Arabians buttons you realize what the
average American listener to this
program will think hearing people talk
about the burning the Gulf you're
essentially saying that this the the net
was seen on television was a mirage but
essentially the main arguments for the
gulf war were were fate really what
we're looking at our underlying economic
profit oriented reasons for pursuing
this war in the Gulf profit and power
profit and power and I would stress
again what Gore said diversion of the
American public but this isn't the
picture that most Americans have
intellectual we're doing their job which
is to prevent people from understanding
what's happening I mean I've just been
speaking at Harvard a pleasant and
gentle place but it however it exists as
does CBS ABC
New York Times to give the viewpoint the
establishment that owned and runs the
country and they have a worldview which
is not coincide at any point with the
new reality that anybody mildly curious
can discover I would say that probably
what the people think on almost any
subject is has been doctored for
sanctions were working against Saddam
the problem was that ninety percent of
the people who when asked to they think
sanctions were working didn't know what
the word meant a few remand Catholics
thought that the sanction was a step
towards st. but somewhere having to be
before Reston had no I did all what
about the debate in the US Senate about
should we authorize the war or not once
our real medley of voices points of view
there didn't go what do you say you saw
a lot of some quite good speech writers
have been involved there and I must
eloquence many people who could not
parse a sentence we're giving her other
nice speeches now what you saw was the
was the total collapse of our
constitutional system of government in
which only Congress may declare war Bush
it went once said what I've been saying
for years why said we've we've done
armed intervention 220 times and five
times we ever declared war
why should have been saying this as
they've been denying it now I should was
praising George Bush now because he
actually decided to follow a legal route
to pursuing this warrant and he also
brought into the coalition some of the
other nations he didn't act unilaterally
needs neither of those statements it was
one of the coalition was the United
States in England in fact up until
January about France up until January
15th
it was a u.s. British command and the
Gulf after it became clear that war was
going to go on France Italy in a couple
of other countries decided they'd like
to get their fingers in the post war
settlements in the u.s. British war very
isolated in the world through the things
28 countries that were in the coalition
most of them were there to enforce the
sanctions in fact and as far as the
legalities are concerned the u.s. just
once again did would have been doing for
many years namely undermine the United
Nations the United Nations has
procedures and they were blocked but
didn't we get a UN resolution well we
notice what the resolution said we got a
resolution which the UN said in effect
we wash our hands of the matter the is
that why would so many countries just
fall back and take a back seat there's a
very frightening please you don't fool
around with it
this is what's been happening the UN for
years let's take the period during which
George Bush has been in national
prominence he was appointed UN
Ambassador in February 71 he says they
take that period during that time the
United States has veto about two-thirds
of the Security Council resolutions that
have been beat go to the veto by the
United States about half of the rest of
the veto by England the United Kingdom
that's between between them that's about
80% way down in third places France and
fourth is a Soviet Union General
Assembly I mean you get votes from the
General Assembly like you know hundred
fifty to one hundred places outside the
law you know we made it very clear over
Nicaragua when we were called before the
International Court at The Hague which
we'd help set up to the beginning of the
century over mining the Nicaraguan
harbors and we said that we don't
recognize the country that's rejecting
reparations I mean when I'm calling on
Iraq to pay reparations but in this
current case if you look closely at what
happened at the UN yeah I think it was
another case in which the United States
and its English lieutenant succeeded in
subverting the United Nations I mean the
UN response was pursued sanctions and
diplomacy as usual effort after any act
of aggression it usually is blocked
right away by the United States we can
because that our undermines that but
look what happened the United States
intervened directly to block diplomacy
I think thank you very probably or a had
worked I mean there were we didn't have
to go through in the past the American
presence wouldn't have gone for you and
supported it in case yeah but look this
was a turning point for the American
Empire no it's a big operation I mean
this is not like invading we know ask
anybody what they think we just invade
Panama this is half a million troops in
the most sensitive area of the world
which everybody is concerned about you
have to get at least the pretense of the
cover of support and in fact after a lot
I'm twisting and pressures and threats
they succeeded in getting the Security
Council to abdicate that's in effect
what happened to this frog in the pan
saying if you put a frog in a hand with
water cold water and sit there you can
heat it up until it becomes boiling and
the fog will feeling nothing was
happening so gradually the farm adapts
to be interchangeable ever the end of it
is a dead frog but he has not had any
anxiety about it well so I said I think
our people of the Frog and pan that
things are going very badly for the
economy for the average person and no
one's doing anything about it and we
have the politics of diversion which are
foreign adventures and we have a
irresponsible to put it mildly press
that the Empire really run out of gas I
mean are we at the end of empire now or
are we just in the middle phase do we
have another 50 years of diversionary
tactics abroad oh the Empire ended in
1950 when we were defeated in Korea that
was really the end and the Russians got
the tap atomic weapons there was then
parity once there's parity you're not
the world empire you may be a world
empire
