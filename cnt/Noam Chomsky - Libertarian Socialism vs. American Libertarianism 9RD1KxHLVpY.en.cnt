you refer to yourself as a libertarian
socialist how does that differ from the
libertarianism best identified in Ron
Paul the Cato Institute with the
National libertarian party well the term
libertarian in the United States has
meaning quite different from what it's
meant traditionally in the long European
tradition their libertarian is the anti
state wing of the Socialist Movement so
the critics of the Bolsheviks from the
left left-wing critics of the Bolsheviks
who regarded Bolshevism as kind of a
right wing deviation they were
libertarian socialists they opposed the
power of the tyrannical state the term
libertarian and in fact they opposed any
form libertarian socialists proposed any
form of legitimate Authority in
domination American libertarians are
quite different they favor tyranny but
the tyranny of private power they don't
want the state to be in a position to
restrict and limit the power of private
capital concentrations corporations
that's if that's advocacy of a form of
tyranny a form of unaccountable private
tyranny and that's quite different from
the libertarian tradition which was
opposed to tyranny of any kind you know
we are we are more libertarian in the in
the strain of Ron Paul and and the Cato
Institute but you know our view is that
there should be no force no coercion and
if individuals are acting in harmony
with each other then I you know I don't
I don't see how that's tyranny
necessarily if there's no no no rules
you can call coercion if you like like
driving on the right instead of driving
anywhere you like if there are no rules
then what will happen will is very
evident we see it before us is plenty of
historical evidence concentrations of
capital will accumulate
but grow larger and larger they'll be
uncontrolled and unconstrained they'll
be predatory and destructive and the
free choices that you'll have will be
either to submit to them with whatever
constraints they impose or starve
