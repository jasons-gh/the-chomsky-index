you ulcerating the book Obama's global
drone assassination program is a
remarkable innovation in global
terrorism let's just imagine that see
Iran had a program where they were
assassinating people around the world
who they suspected of intending to harm
you read plenty of choices to do is read
the New York Times in the Washington
Post they read the op-ed it's saying we
have to bomb Iran right now they can
read official pronouncements and say all
options are open meaning we can attack
them with nuclear weapons if we like
they can look at the actual facts that
are not only conceded but presented with
praise namely that the u.s. carried out
significant cyber war attacks against
Iran u.s. government regards cyber war
attacks as acts of war which legitimate
the military response the NATO agrees
the NATO has accepted that if any NATO
country is attacked by cyber war that
brings into operation the mutual defense
condition of the NATO treaty nearly any
country can respond with military force
nuclear scientists in Iran are getting
assassinated so they have plenty of
targets suppose they started just
assassinated and then going on to
assassinate other people who were just
suspected of having similar intentions
and meanwhile killing anybody else who
happened to be around and in fact
imposing a reign of terror where if you
live in one of the areas say in the
Yemen that they said maybe Washington DC
where they want to assassinate lots of
people as you walk around the streets
you have to think that maybe in two
seconds that guy across the street
anybody neurons blown away that's what
you live with unprecedented innovation
in that's the most elementary principles
of our own system of justice and law
kind of ironic that this is happening on
the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta
which was limited it established for the
first time in a significant way of
innocent persons innocent unless proven
guilty in a fair trial by jury peers
that's the foundation of anglo-american
law expanded over the years anyways
what's is there is there a due process
in this case kind of interestingly that
question was raised by journalists to
the Obama administration and their
answer was interesting from the Justice
Department yes there is due process
because in the executive branch we
consider the background of the people
before we kill them and then they added
they can of course be judged to be
innocent later through evidence
King John I'm with magna carta it would
have cheer just throws out totally the
entire basis of law justice as well as
being a remarkable assassination Kenneth
BAE of course that's not at all the kind
of thing that Jeremy Scahill others have
exposed about Special Forces operations
is simply another form of global terror
and it has the expected effect it
increases what we call terrorism if you
attack it
Yemenite village murder some guy and
everyone is standing around their
cousins uncles and children prevent not
only because they live in tribal
cultures which is the way to be
interpreted we would react the same way
and it does expand the what we call the
terrorist system you can see it by the
expansion of it from a small area of
tribal location in Afghanistan to the
entire world
