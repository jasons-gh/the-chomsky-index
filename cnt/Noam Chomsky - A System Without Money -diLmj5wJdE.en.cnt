while the sea tell me is this a too high
level of abstraction you mentioned this
everything you're discussing here is
based on a system of money
can one conceive of a system operating
without money
are we on yeah yeah I think that we're
we're talking about very concrete
questions can we think about a different
social order yeah I think we can think
about a very different social order
getting rid of money is one part of it
which I don't think is the crucial part
the crucial part is getting rid of
tyranny we happen to be living in a
system which would have driven the
founding fathers up the wall on which
any enlightenment figure like Adam Smith
or someone would have found her rendus
it's a it's a tyrannical system and
which power is more and more going into
the hands of totalitarian structures
which are unaccountable namely private
corporations the as has long been
understood these are tyrannical
structures they are like totalitarian
states they combine in the command
center judicial legislative and
executive powers they're pretty much
unaccountable to anyone they're huge in
scale by now
they they involved they were created for
distorting markets and they carry out
extreme market distortion like in they
internalize risk they don't they free
participants from market discipline and
I have a million other ways of
undermining markets whether one thinks
markets are good or bad in any event
these are tyrannical systems which have
the right to exist any more than other
tyrannical systems and they have an
extraordinary effect over life I mean
they are the media when we talk about
the media reflecting their interests
that's you know like saying I reflect my
interest yes of course they do the it's
not just the media it's the
entertainment industry and you know
advertising and so on this is all a
reflection of network of private
tyrannies they have an overwhelming
effect on government they don't like
government because government has a
defect
it's harshali influenceable by the
public
whereas GE is not influenceable at all
so the ID so they've been trying to
create for 50 years they've been trying
to create a mood of ante politics you
know hate the government true we have
the government pretty much by the throat
but it's not totally those guys out
there can still influence it so let's
get them to hate the government in
particular to hate the federal
government state governments aren't so
bad they're small enough so we can
really run them totally federal
government is fairly large and you know
you can't come around to much that's the
point behind the devolution getting
things down to the state level under
some circumstances it might be
democratic under these circumstances
anti-democratic you move things down to
the state level and even middle sized
businesses can tell them what to do so
the government national level well okay
maybe you know Microsoft and GE but not
small guys so let's get power down
decision when you when you when you take
say FTC any kind of so-called welfare
system you put it down to the state
level you're guaranteeing there's not
going to go to poor people because at
that level even middle sized businesses
can insist upon the regressive fiscal
measures and shift in the tax code and
this that and the other thing which will
mean that the money goes to the rich at
the federal level it's harder you're
pushing around the bigger things so the
ideas get reduced the federal government
except for the parts that work for us
like and those increase like the
Pentagon say so increase that one
because that works for us but cut down
the parts that work for anyone else go
down to the state level reduce them even
further put even more precision making
into the hands of private unaccountable
power that's the core of the system and
that's what's got to be dismantled
totally has no legitimacy comes out of
the same intellectual roots as fascism
and Bolshevism in ought to be dismantled
the same way where you go from there
well you know there one could discuss
now there are lots of ways in which you
could have a democratically run in
society it's worth discussing and
thinking about but the existence of
money it seems to me is a side part of
it may be money should be part of
these in society maybe it should I
suspect it probably should some form of
means of exchange but it's kind of like
a technical question on the side the
real question is tyranny
