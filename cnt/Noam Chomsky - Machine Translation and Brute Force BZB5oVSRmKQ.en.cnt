there's been a lot of response that I've
read to your criticism of natural
language processing and statistical
machine learning I'm wondering if you
could maybe give your most updated
argument against or you know your
opinion of natural language processing
and statistical machine learning and
kind of how do you think those fields
are what their deficits are with respect
to you well I actually took a position
on that in 1955 I had just gotten out of
college finished my PhD I didn't have
any opportunity to have a job
anywhere cuz my field didn't exist but I
was offered I was offered a position at
MIT
it says science-based University they
don't really care much whether you have
credentials fortunately for me but the
job was offered to me was at the
research level a lab of electronics in
machine translation natural language
processing and they were trying then to
develop a linguistics section which they
thought would yield insight and
understanding at the language which
would make it possible to do effective
machine translation and I told the
director of the lab Jerry Wiesner later
became candidate science advisor MIT
president I told them you know I'm
perfectly happy to have the job but I'm
not going to work on machine translation
and he asked why and I said the reason
is we are so far from having a
principled understanding that could
contribute to solving this problem that
it's just the wrong way to proceed I
think it should be done by brute force
and about 30 years later IBM came around
to the great discovery that they should
do it by brute force and that's the way
it's done so I think that's okay I mean
I use the Google
translator it's kind of useful there's
absolutely no intellectual interest it
is literally brute force
it's about as interesting as a big
bulldozer which is fine I have no
objection to bulldozers either so all of
this is fine you know if you don't
understand a problem and that is most
problems you do the best you can with
the technology that you have available
and in fact if you think of the history
of engineering it really wasn't until
about the 1950s that the sciences
fundamental sciences had very much to
contribute to engineering so when I got
to MIT in the 50s there were there were
very good physics and math departments
but they were service departments they
were teaching the engineers tricks so
they could solve some of their problems
a little better when they were designing
bridges or making circuits and so on
there was a big change right at that
period the part mainly because a huge
amount of Pentagon money that went into
basic science and technology Anna
changed the place ten years later MIT
was not an engineering school by the
1960s when some of you guys came it was
a science University there was
engineering but it was basically a kind
of Applied an application of the basic
sciences so by now students take pretty
much the same courses whatever
engineering discipline they're in they
take basic math basic physics basic
chemistry biology and there's some
application to their particular field
that's a huge change that's physics you
know we're here talking about cognitive
science studying human intelligence
nobody knows anything about that it's
very hard topic so the chances of
getting a principled explanation one
with theoretical interest I think
it's important to work on my math is
extremely important topic we'd like to
understand about ourselves but the idea
that they're going to be direct
applications i think is pretty utopian
so you do it by brute force so I have no
objection to it thank you
