no reaction that's power in the
aftermath of conflicts to what extent or
truth and reconciliation commissions a
viable form of achieving justice and
accountability I think they make sense
in many situations so for example Allah
takes a South Africa they were horrible
crimes committed under apartheid but to
try to punish people for those crimes
would have torn the society to shreds
undermine any hope of progress and
development so a decision was made by
the entity which i think is
understandable to avoid direct
punishment and to settle for a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission to expose the
nature of what happens to at least it's
kind of understood sins done and Central
America same in Brazil same in East
Timor take East Timor which was if the
term genocide has any meaning
Indonesia did in East Timor with the
backing of the United States Britain
whether Western countries England Sweden
that's close to Genesis teamwork funded
amazingly when it's independent now
should they care deaths should they try
to carry out war crimes trials against
Indonesia Australia United States others
or should they try to mend the fences
with Indonesia and maybe settle for a
Truth and Reconciliation Commission I
think the latter which is in fact what
they're doing they have to live in the
world right let's take where we have to
be sitting right now the native
population suffered than the migrant
crisis of a incredible kind not the kind
that we talked about the migrant crisis
where the immigrants come in with the
intention of exterminating and expelling
the population that it's not what we
call a crisis but that's what happened
here there are remnants of the people
who used to live here never a
reservation and gave God
should they is to war crimes trials
against the people who live in their
homes would make a lot of sense it would
make a lot of sense to bring out
understanding of what happened to call
for reparations and so on but not work
for our struggles just means nothing
visit genocide in the population of this
territory of the United States time the
colonists arrived was nobody knows for
sure maybe ten minutes something like
that but in 1900 it was when there was a
census it was about this the Western
Hemisphere that maybe eighty million
people
Columbus arrived pretty soon about 90%
of them
