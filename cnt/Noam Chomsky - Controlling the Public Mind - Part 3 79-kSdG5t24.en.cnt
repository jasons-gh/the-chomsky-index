there is a very powerful you know
extraordinarily powerful part of the
entire foot of capitalist ideology is
making you worry only about yourself
lose any connection to other people
destroy solidarity just leave solidarity
in the hands of the investing class the
rest of you just worry about yourself
this goes way back you read the
working-class press and 1850 in round
the places like where I live you know
which was in round New England which was
the center of the early Industrial
Revolution it was very lively
working-class press run by mechanics and
what they call factory girls the young
women off the farms and so on a very
interesting reading but one of the
things that they were denouncing was
exactly this tendency the what they call
the new spirit of the age gain wealth
for getting all but self you know which
they regarded as degrading and demeaning
and destroying you know their human
values and so on correctly in fact the
labor movement throughout his whole
history's been fighting against this
work together you know because we're all
in it together we want to help each
other that's a very different ethic as
it's a traditional ethic it took modern
capitalism to even question it but and I
think that what questions is very adding
human well that shows up in connection
with schools it comes down to the
question do I care whether the kids down
the street get an education well I think
we should you know I think we should
care the
but notice that means that means public
education in fact I think that's the
major motive for public education like
public health you know it's like a
public health system do we do I care
that the kids down the street have
sewage okay well same question you know
why not just me I should have sewage and
that they should have a like you know
hold on about in the backyard well you
know that's a question of what kind of a
world you want to live in if you want to
live in a world where people care for
each other care about each other yeah I
think we've tightened at least I think
we ought to live for that kind of a
world but then that some form of
community education whatever you call it
is part of it it means that children
ought to have the best opportunities
they can have and the best chance for
developing their own powers that they
can get it whether they're my kids or
somebody else's kids and the whole move
towards vouchers and privatization and
so on is in Africa as far as I can see
like trying to privatize health care
which is well who cares if they're
healthy down there as long as I'm rich
enough to buy health care for myself and
it's a very dangerous tendency to rise
of work
it's me isn't it socialize but it's the
same as with many carrots like you're
giving their choice like you have to
like go to school well that's Tibbett
see the best look how many could
entertain but Medicare how many it like
what kind of Israel each end of it yeah
sure so a a community system or a public
system set of Plenty choices and it's
the same for the same way health care I
can get health care coverage if I go to
a medical doctor but if I could what
natural athlete doctor visit Gates Qatar
but mine so there is there anything
shows like okay well we have this
socialize education in social what we
want but that's what a democratic a
democratic society and a free society of
cooperating people or to allow options
if if you're only given the choice of
everybody's kids go to a factory call
the school or else I make choices for
them well that's not very good set of
choices but I think we ought to be
working for a public education system
that you know that they're really does
provide the opportunities and options
and freedom and so on up to some limit I
mean you know he can't hug the limit has
to be determined by a community exactly
one of my kids I ended up sending
through a private school to though none
favourite discuss
yeah one of my daughters actually ended
up with your friends school which is
about as close to that as you get in the
Boston area but that was for you know I
wasn't happy about it but for various
reasons given the options within the
public school system we just fell didn't
do it so I'm not saying that these are
easy personal choices given bad options
they're not and the same strip health
you know like I mean I know that like if
you might one of my kids let's say
really needed expensive health care and
you couldn't get it through the public
system I'd find a way to pay for it
myself though I don't think there ought
to beat that ought to happen well it's
because we're given a set of bad choices
so within the set of bad choices I think
things is try to make them better not
eliminate the good things because some
aspects usually not working I mean in a
way it's like you know anything you
point to is going to be like that every
institution that exists is distorted by
concentration of power and many other
things fine so you try to overcome those
distorting effects but you don't throw
away whatever is useful about
institution you say something about the
labor movement on the labor movement I
think it's been over Oh over the years
has been a major force and
democratization and improving people's
lives and so on and so forth on the
other hand is crooked as hell you know
all involved with gangsters and so on
and so forth well ok you know see
instead of saying okay let's throw out
the labor movement what you say is let's
get rid of that aspect of it make it
more responsive to workers there's been
a lot of yeah okay let's let's yeah and
I waited madness but I think you know
yeah I think it's better to keep to the
mic story I didn't mean to cut off the
previous speaker i have a question
there's been a lot of discussion lately
about the fact that corporate profits
have been rising while at the same time
layoffs of employees have been going off
as well
and recently the Secretary of Labor in
the US and the Minister of Industry in
Canada have both made well fairly
tapping tepid comments about the the
conduct of corporations laying off
workers when their profits are
skyrocketing and I just want to hear
your comments on that well first of all
a officers at least of it I mean for
about 20 years now nah wages wages step
in the ice pick and I only know the
detail figures for the United States and
Europe I don't know them for Canada but
in the United States at least let me
talk about that I don't think it's much
different here around the early
seventies wages started to stag real
real income started to stagnate and by
around nineteen eighty it started
decline so if you take the median wage
you know half below half but it's been
declining fairly steadily since around
nineteen eighty that continued right
through the Clinton recovery the Clinton
years the recovery was in fact the
growth was faster than during the Reagan
years but it was unprecedented and that
wages kept going down so I think
something like a fair number 95 /
Snyder's though of the family some very
high number a lost family income from 89
1989 when recession so it through 1993
which is after the recovery and it's the
last year for which we have figures and
it's probably still going down for what
they call unskilled workers which means
like 70 to 75 percent of the workforce
but they've lost about twenty percent or
so of income since about nineteen eighty
that's the core of this you know angry
voicemail phenomenon and so on what
Buchanans appealing to for college
graduates wages started going down
around nineteen eighty-seven after the
full effect of the Reaganite social
changes hit and they're still going down
so there's so laughs is one aspect of it
that the other aspect is just a general
collapse a general attack on working
people across a very broad spectrum at
the same time corporate profits are just
onion you know breaking all records if
you read fortune and Business Week and
so on they can't even find the
adjectives anymore to describe how
stupendous and dazzling and so on it is
last year if your fortune has every
fortune magazine of the big business
magazine ever even what may has an issue
devoted to the fortune 500 the top 500
corporations and last the one last May
was really pretty pretty impressive I
mean they couldn't get over how
fantastic was fourth straight year of
double-digit profit growth you know
fifty four percent profit growth last
year they expected to continue after
four years of it so the country is just
flooded with capital you know it's not
lean and mean or anything like that
absolutely flooded with capital more and
more narrowly concentrated well for most
of the populations either stagnation or
decline well layoffs is one aspect of
that that happens to be hitting the
newspapers now but it's pretty small
aspect of the whole picture well that's
you know these are the results of very
definite social policy back starting in
the early 70s pretty powerful new
weapons were placed into the hands of
private Erinyes what we call private
business which is just big totalitarian
institutions basically unaccountable
ones and they got a lot of new weapons
to be people over the head with and by
want the main one being the huge
explosion of financial markets which was
just been extraordinary in scale and
that's had an enormous the thing I mean
give you some of the numbers if you like
they're really mind-boggling the effects
were already understood by the late
seventies pretty well understood that
this was going to drive down growth
rates concentrate wealth lead to a kind
of low-wage low growth high profit
equilibrium but that's the only part of
it
the another aspect of it is that there
is now tremendous pressure from invest
from financial markets you know big
money managers which have to have huge
amounts of capital in their hands and
can move it around very fast one effect
of contemporary poet communications is
you can take say the whole new york
banking system and put it in tokyo every
search every every day you know so you
can use the financial markets over there
and make a little more money and then
you some over here and make a little
more money i mean that's why you have it
takes a MIT you know science engineering
school their corporate recruiters to
come around that reading no mage in to
try to pick up the smart guys in the
science and engineering the PhD last
year twenty five percent of them are
from Wall Street corporate recruiters
they were going after math and physics
phd's these guys don't know anything
about Wall Street but they're smart guys
who know how to work out complicated
scams that will enable you to get a tiny
bit more profit by you know some
intricate device in speculative markets
that's having a huge effect on the
international economy and the domestic
economy for example it's forcing it's
forcing corporations to move toward to
say a manager a guy who's doing the
actual you know the guys in a management
position in a corporation to say the CEO
or is it guys on the board of directors
it's forcing them to look for a very
short-term profit because if they don't
go for a very short-term profit there's
going to be a rapid exit of capital to
somewhere else which is getting
short-term profit and that's having it
probably has worked it out yet but
there's a general assessment that this
is having a very harmful effect on the
economy altogether just as the rapid
transfer of that's the
enormous growth of capital that's used
for speculation against currencies is
also having a tremendous effect it moves
towards it attacks any any any country
even a big country like the United
States that tried to introduce
stimulative measures capital would flow
out of it really fast because this
capital does not want growth what they
want to stable currencies and growth can
threaten stable currencies do they want
low growth stable currencies you know no
inflation tremendous profits and wages
going down and at home you're getting
pressures against the immuno private
enterprise never does much long-term
planning but whatever there is there's
pressure against it because you want to
make sure that you have high profits the
next quarter or else you want to lose
the capital that can move around very
fast now so these things are having big
effects and they started around the
early seventies and have been expanding
ever since and there are others you know
what they call globalization you know
the huge there's been a considerable
escalation of trans Nationals and so on
and so forth and in different ways than
in the past they're doing different
things than they used to do they always
been around but all of these are putting
very powerful weapons into the hands of
private power and they're using it to
try to unravel the social contract that
has been established after lots of
struggle big attack on labor
incidentally is part of it so in the
United States as you know unionization
has gone way down but it isn't a large
part of that is I don't like the term
conspiracy inning don't use it much but
this is real conspiracy there was a
state corporate conspiracy in the 80s
very blatant state corporate conspiracy
to destroy unions now corporations have
always wanted to destroy unions but they
were but state power in the 80s
essentially authorized it and pretty
openly the only place where I've seen
really good review
this is in the business press which are
very frank about it businessweek for
example a very good stories about how
the government basically pulled the
private sector from the early 80s
they're simply not going to enforce the
laws so do what you like you know and in
fact the number of illegal firings of
organizers shot up I went up by like a
factor six or something the number of
the corporations were told that OSHA the
safety and health Thornton office of
safety and health something or other you
know the government office that looks
after safety and health standards would
simply not enforce standards and in fact
the number of days of the number of
working days lost to injury went up by
about fifty percent very quickly and
that's across the board illegal firings
the use of it has been technically legal
in the United States since the late 30s
to use permanent replacement workers
United States may be one of the few
industrial countries where this is even
on the books but it's after the Wagner
Act was packed in a past 29 35 which
sort of which for the first time gave
workers the right to organize the fat in
just about every other industrial
country Supreme Court very quickly
undercut it within a few years and
technically allowed the right to hire
permanent replacement workers which is
much worse than scabs notice but but the
balance of forces was such that the
major corporations could never do it
never thought of doing it well by the
late 80s they started thinking of doing
it and the first big manufacturing
corporation big manufacturing
corporation to do it was caterpillar I
was part of a major union busting
strategy and right at the center of the
heartland of working-class America
Decatur Illinois big working-class town
three major unions you know biggest
unions and there was a big corporate
attack on them three transnationals to
one British one Japanese and one
caterpillar US base
and they just want to destroy the unions
very openly they use the huge profits
they use their excess capacity overseas
like caterpillar explained its business
strategy at least in the business press
they said that they're going to force
they're going to force workers to
capitulate because they've used their
enormous profits to build excess
capacity overseas like in Brazil and so
on which allows them to fill their
international markets even if they don't
produce you Plus permanent replacement
workers here and you know lot it's huge
growth and temporary workers you know
you know no benefits all I kind of stuff
well these weapon this got I mean
actually the United States was actually
censured by the International Labor
Organization which is extremely rare
they never tap the risk of their rich
funders but it got to the point that the
u.s. was actually censured by the ILO
for using permanent replacement workers
which violin the caterpillar case which
violates all International Labor
Standards and in fact the US was urged
to sort of accept international labor
standards which it doesn't all right
this was outright conspiracy I mean the
state federal government simply
authorized the use of illegal methods
some of them flatly illegal methods to
attack and destroy and undermine unions
well they couldn't gotten away with that
earlier incidentally here's another case
where the left simply abandoned the
terrain to cater workers were going
around the pic of course they weren't
covered in the press not you know
obviously you don't expect the corporate
media to cover this stuff but the cater
workers were really fight they all lost
instantly they got smashed and they all
it was a total disaster all through port
and a big part of the reason for that
was that the pot people who ought to be
the left just didn't give a damn like in
Boston when staley workers came to try
to organize some support we had a
meeting for them which auto have been
this many people it's in the room where
this
people show up for anything there were
75 people it's the first time I've
talked at it I talk a lot at those
meetings on every imaginable topic is
the first time in about 20 years I've
seen the place almost feel why well it
is bunch of you know white male who
cares about them and working people from
Decatur Illinois who are trying to
preserve and restore and ultimately
rebuild the American labor movement okay
those are the kind of guys are going to
be out in the malicious pretty soon or
listening to Pat Buchanan and I think we
can partly blame ourselves for that not
in significantly but the point is there
were powerful weapons and they're being
used all over the world I'm the United
States and Britain their first they were
used to destroy the weaker working
classes like in Latin America Latin
American on Latin America pre organized
and powerful working classes but they're
much weaker societies so there is
smashed by structural adjustment and so
on there by now really devastated
throughout the continent in the
industrial world it's a tougher nut to
crack and it started with the United
States and England the United States
anyone our worst in this respect but the
Thatcher Reagan period it's a big attack
on working people also on families on
children you know across the board and
Europe and Japan or not are still kind
of holding on Canada start in between I
mean it's somewhere between the United
States and eggs and the anglo-american
model in the European Japanese model but
in a more integrated global economy it's
going to be awful hard for anybody to
hold out unless there is substantial
popular resistance because most of it
what's actually happening is most of the
world is being turned into a kind of
third world you can see there's pretty
dramatic and places like the United
States and England less so and
continental Europe but unless there's
substantial resistance to this that's
pretty much what's going to happen so
layoffs is a piece of it but it's a much
bigger picture and I don't think that
the kind of book that's coming out of
Washington even relates to this issue I
mean asking corporations to be nicer
you know that's like a joke you know in
fact there there was back around like in
the Kennedy years around that period
there was a lot of talk about how
corporations had changed I remember one
colleague of mine was in fact the head
of these two for advanced studies and
then was in the Kennedy administration
and it might be there's an economist
wrote a paper called the soulful
corporation that is the corporations
that becomes soulful you know they used
to be kind of money-grubbing and so on
but now they're and that is just
ridiculous I mean if any corporation
here Milton Friedman and those guys are
absolutely right if a corporation tried
to be anything but you know really
monsters they would it would be
basically illegal they would not be
fulfilling their responsibilities to
their shareholders and furthermore they
would be eliminated they'd be cut out of
the market because somebody else
wouldn't be soulful and would be making
more money this is institutional you
know has nothing do with anybody being
nice these are institutional faction as
long as I mean it's like trying to ask
you know the thumb totalitarian state to
be more nice to its people well you know
it doesn't make sense what you do with
the totalitarian state is eliminated you
don't ask it to be nicer to people and
these are totalitarian systems these a
corporation is a totalitarian system and
by now they're very big ones you know
they're huge command economy which are
internally modeled I mean they're just
the you know the heathers pretty much
the structure with the tellurian state
they unify the judicial legislative and
executive functions and a top
unaccountable control system the only
accountability is to investors which
means other
banks and you know big investment firms
and so on I and public accountability is
limited to the regulatory system which
of course they're trying to destroy so
it's essentially a takeover of power by
Big totalitarian institutions which
incidentally their rates come their
roots are not very to about the same as
the other contemporary forms of
totalitarianism Bolshevism and that ism
they all come out of late 19th century
you know vaguely hug alien ideas about
organic entities having rights above
individuals and so on and so forth
there's actually pretty good scholarly
work on on this on the origin of 20th
century with corporations got their
current power mostly in the early part
of the century you know they're not like
sort of graven in stone the rights of
immortal persons with things like free
speech and you know all that kind of
stuff that's early 20th century and it
was not granted by legislation either it
was done mostly by courts and lawyers
and so on and it's a form of
totalitarianism and you don't ask it to
be more soulful anymore now just on to
be more soulful it's these are
institutional structures they behave the
way they do yet the Eliminator and so
these were truisms in the working-class
movement not very long ago by now they
sound really weird but that's the sign
of the of the victory of powerful
propaganda systems corporate propaganda
system isn't Lee driven out of people's
heads what used to be everybody's
understanding in fact you go back to the
early century ago in the AFL you know
which is not particularly radical these
are the things people are talking about
the national meetings you know let's get
rid of all these things and working
people working people ought to own the
mills and the and run them there they
build them they work in them the other
runner that was one of the big issues in
homestead
it's right back in eighteen ninety to
know well you know if it's been beaten
out of people's heads that's our our
problem we ought to get it back in
people said it's not very strange sort
of natural and automatic just like
opposition any other form of
totalitarianism and playing games about
them they should be nicer to people that
doesn't mean anything yeah sure if you
can sort of impose by force if you can
use federal say OSHA if you can impose
health and safety standards on them fine
that's better than not having those
standards but there should be no
illusions that's like forcing its
totality reinstate because of some
countervailing force to act nicer okay
maybe you can do it but that's not the
answer um okay yeah um I consider myself
to be a Machiavellian excuse me your use
of the word totalitarian is a poo term
and I'm not afraid it is one of that far
to catch them in a descriptive term our
kitchen who wrote a book and fascism
calls in abu term who martin kitchen up
at sfu he wrote a book on fascism
totalitarianism is a boo term what you
got to do is unpack them usage of the
word totalitarianism Machiavelli if you
look at Machiavellianism as
Machiavellianism from above and from
below Bakunin has been called a
Machiavellianism from below I think
we're we need more envious workers we
don't need sentimentality from Noam
Chomsky this is not too sentimental
about the workers all the portal
bleeding workers we need envy from below
and greed from above we're not going to
get anything but greed from above you
would admitted that but you want
sentimentality from below I don't want
rid of mentality i want struggle freedom
justice what's wrong
and when I incidentally when but when I
used the word took a latarian I met it I
Troy didn't say much about it but when I
was talking about centralizing the
legislative executive and judicial
functions in a top center i was actually
quoting I didn't say so because it
wasn't time but I was quoting from a
pretty mainstream political annoyed
political economist back when i was at
around nine to the early 1940s robert
Grady who wrote a book on businesses
system of power in which he described
quite well the way in which totalitarian
institutions like corporations were
developing in the industrial world with
many counterparts to the fascist systems
there's more recent work when I
mentioned scholarship I had something in
mind too there's a legal historian at
Harvard very good when Martin Horowitz
who has two big fat books on the
transformation of American law and if
you look at the second volume he goes
which is the more you know goes through
say 1862 19 20 or so he talks about the
origin of modern corporate corporations
in corporate law and exactly these terms
this is these are descriptive terms they
are not boo terms ok why can't we have
something like Max learners alliance of
ego is from below well you can have it
if you want but that's not the world are
you want sentimentality an organism of
the horn week well with an organic what
you call honey dizzam Protonotary nism
of the left wing I think we've exhausted
ace topic you want sentimentalism of the
left wing Organa scizzum of the left
wing excuse me that's what it sounds
like to you he
thank you um yeah this left bit what is
going on 12 so thank you I'm not long
ago in this province us and if some
changes were made in the legislature to
legislation to make stir the penalties
for things like distribution of hate
literature in response to an increased
perception of groups like the Aria
nation and that and the Heritage front
and well it's it's definitely important
to preserve free speech freedom of
speech it is also clear that the
increased activity of such groups also
needs to be dressed as well and I'm
wondering what thoughts you might have
about what means could be done so apart
from trying to make stricter penalties
for distribution of hate literature well
I'm against it I don't think the state
should have the power to decide what
people think and say I don't want the
state at that power and I think it's bad
to have people running around with hate
literature but the way to do it is not
to give power to some more dangerous
entity like the state the what you have
to do is meet them on you know get to
the people that they're reaching right
they are reaching people who are
susceptible to this literature why well
for reasons the kind i mentioned let's
take the people who have been subjected
to the social policies that we all know
in which we just alluded to yeah they're
going to be frightened angry they're
going to search for somebody to blame it
on they're going to be easy targets for
hate literature just as they were under
the Nazis well the way to deal with that
was not to outlaw mine comp that would
not change the thing it was to deal with
the sources in the society for what
Hitler was appealing to and the same is
true here incidentally if you're worried
about talk that harms people picking out
hate literature is a very odd choice yes
that harms people but the free market
ideology harms them way more
if you take if you want no people who
are really sucking you know let's I
really suffering from the kind of IMF
fundamentalism which is mostly phoning
but it's true that it's a dominant
ideology at least among eglee's well you
know go to you know Africa or Latin
America course lumps in the United
States and you'll find people suffering
mostly women incidentally and suffering
misery like mortality rates for women
and infants have gone way up ok hate
literature hasn't done that if you're
worried about harming people there are
much more obvious candidates and the
answer to this is not to have the state
powerful enough to stop people from
talking about this stuff that's not the
answer
I don't think i can say thank you any
better than all of you have to know
thanks very much on behalf of the pc
Federation of Labor and the Vancouver
and district Labor Council and my thanks
to all of you for being so patient
