like every just about every word that's
used for in social and political
discourse has two meanings it has its
literal meaning and a meaning that's
used for political warfare which is
often quite different that's true of
everything sometimes it's quite
interesting so pick save the notion
person fundamental notion is very
interesting to see the way that's
evolved in American law up to the
present and used in a way which in which
is highly significant right now so you
go back to the Magna Carta it says all
free men have certain rights you know
jury trial duper what we call due
process and so on a couple centuries
later that was expanded to free people
when it crosses the Atlantic and enters
the constitutional system it was
modified again it's it's free white men
okay so blacks are out and of course the
indigenous population are out they have
no rights exterminated and women were up
so as I mentioned it was until 1975 but
even I guarantee to be on Jorah couldn't
vote till the nineteen twenties and so
on so it was a person me the Fifth
Amendment says no person shall be
deprived of right you know without due
process but didn't mean the indigenous
population didn't mean blacks it didn't
mean native-americans it didn't even
mean it's mean women and it didn't even
mean poor man because you had to you
know hit poll taxes and various kinds of
restrictions but when you get to the
Fourteenth Amendment the word has
changed its expanded its again the same
phrase you know no person shall be
deprived of right it technically
included freed slaves that was only
technical but within a couple of years
back in slavery after reconstruction but
at least technically it did it
informally get rights for another
century 1960s still excluded women but
it was expanded as you all know over the
next century to include corporations so
without going through the history when
you get up to the present you look at
the recent Supreme Court cases they both
expand and restrict the notion person
it's expanded to include corporations of
Rights way beyond human you know people
flesh and blood it's also restricted
it's restricted to explicitly to exclude
undocumented aliens they cannot they
don't fall in the category of persons
Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled on
this over the years and the latest is
versal the Rumsfeld very reason they're
not persons they don't have the right of
free speech they'll have any of the
rights in the Bill of Rights because
they're not persons there what George
Orwell called unpeopled meaning kind of
look like people but it superficially
not people
