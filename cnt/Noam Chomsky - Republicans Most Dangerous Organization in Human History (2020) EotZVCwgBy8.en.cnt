it's been a particularly eerie beginning
to the new neck new decade not just this
business with Iran but also the fires in
Australia which is probably a good segue
to climate change I know you've said
recently and I should add the
qualification that you give as well when
you make this statement that you believe
the Republican Party is the most
dangerous organisation in human history
and you add that you know that's an
outrageous statement but could you could
you elaborate on that what why do you
say that let's go back to the first
power of negotiations the goal of the of
the Paris negotiations was to reach a
treaty in which countries would commit
themselves to specific reductions in
emissions that it would be the
verifiable census international treaty
that couldn't be done for one reason the
Republican Party would not agree to
allow that so what happened instead was
is it a just a set of promises without
any not carrying any force which is much
less less significant of course
subsequent with international meetings
tried to enforce these regulations they
were constantly blocked by the United
States under the pressure of the
Republican Party the latest ones in
Madrid
of the u.s. at a presence that the sole
role of the US presence listed to try to
prevent anything from happening whether
it's eight other countries fixed
commitments to the missions whatever it
might be which were in addition to the
head to being the only country the only
major country in the world that
refusing to take any steps to deal with
this urgent crisis and the Republican
Party is dedicated openly and publicly
to try to maximize the threat to use the
maximum to have the maximum possible use
of fossil fuels but to cut back on even
domestic regulations that would just for
the benefit of the population of the
United States so just a couple of days
ago President Donald Trump they issued
an executive order probably illegal as
the courts will determine that he issued
an executive order to send early
dismantle the major environmental
protection legislation with respect
fifty years to Richard Nixon to monitor
and control the poisonous substances
that going into the water supply many
other such conditions
the idea is to maximize the coming
destruction and to harm the population
of the United States as much as possible
sounds strong just take a look at this
at the legislation and it's very
interesting to see the thinking behind
so the National Transportation Authority
got a year ago published what in my mind
is one of the astonish most astonishing
documents in human history literally
it's an environmental assessment careful
environmental assessment couple hundred
pages concludes that by the end of the
century temperatures will had risen four
degrees that agree but anyone who
follows this knows that the scientific
community the World Bank describes such
a temperature
we industrial levels as Cataclysm is
basically the end over twice as high as
the maximum level they think is possible
for organizing human life and after
having drawn this conclusion conclusion
this is said that made this assessment
they draw a conclusion inclusion is we
should put no further restrictions on
emissions or a motive emissions they
don't give the reasoning but I guess you
can imagine me that we're going off the
cliff
anyway I so might not have a good time I
can't think of another interpretation
except maybe Jenny will some computers
if you can find a document like that in
history I'd be interested in seeing I
mean what comes to mind maybe is the
bonzi the Declaration of Nazi Germany
1942 deciding to the murder all the Jews
killed 30 minutes long
pretty awful but not saying let's
destroy it all organized human life on
earth which is what this I think you
have to remember that he's pretty close
to it the level of global warming of
about 125,000 years ago when sea levels
were about six to nine meters higher
than they are today try to imagine a
world in which that's the case let alone
the acceleration of the mass
acceleration is that what's going on in
Australia extraordinary with the drought
huge droughts they're causing enormous
problems all over the world India with
temperatures reaching the 50 degree
centigrade last summer
Rajasthan engines I think what this
means for much of the world I mean it's
it's just no words to capture so it's
the most dangerous organization in human
history it's a pretty credible state
