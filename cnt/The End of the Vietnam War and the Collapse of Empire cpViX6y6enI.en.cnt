come to John J and to all of our
students and there's so many of you here
this is a very exciting evening
tonight's event is one in a series being
held at the college this semester on the
topic of conflicting concepts of justice
in the 1970s three years ago we
sponsored a series on the 1950s and
guess what last year the 1960s these
semester long considerations of
important decades in American history
were the brainchild of visiting
professor Michael Meeropol and we're so
thrilled that he's on our faculty and
have been organized in collaboration
with the interdisciplinary studies
program or I should say department as is
appropriate for a college that educates
for justice the decades have been
examined through the twin lenses of
justice and injustice that has been
their focus this evening I want to thank
Sarah Tornai of the Jewish Association
for services for the aged for the
association's co-sponsorship of
tonight's lecture and I also want to
thank professor Michael Meeropol
professor Jerry Markowitz the
interdisciplinary studies chairperson
Amy green is here somewhere and deputy
chair Richard haw for their support of
tonight's event and all three years of
remarkable programs that have featured
some exciting and distinguished guests
among them Tony Kushner and peter Yarrow
of Peter Paul and Mary Fame those of you
too young to remember Peter Paul and
Mary okay I do so our guest lecturer
this evening is similarly illustrious
professor Noam Chomsky professor Chomsky
spoke yes go ahead you can applaud him
again why not
professor Chomsky spoke during our 1950s
series and it's my great pleasure and
honor to welcome him back to John Jay
this evening you're a part of the family
now one more visit and we're gonna
literally adopt you well I don't have to
tell this crowd that Noam Chomsky is the
foremost linguist in the world a
philosopher a cognitive scientist a
logician an historian a political critic
and an activist he is an intellectual
rockstar and that's why you all wanted
your pictures taken with him right it's
really quite a thrill he's also a
professor at an institute professor and
professor emeritus in the Department of
linguistics and philosophy at MIT a
scientist through and through professor
Chomsky scientific approach first
revealed itself in his path-breaking
work as a linguist beginning with
syntactic structures in 1957 and
continuing with current issues in the
linguistic theory semantics in
generative grammar and knowledge of
language in the early 1960s he
determined to apply his scientific
principles and his keen moral sense to
the political struggles around the u.s.
war against the people of Indochina
beginning with the publication of an
article in The New York Review of Books
the responsibilities of intellectuals of
call to action if ever there was one
published in 1967 he has remained
steadfast in his judgment that when
political and intellectual leaders in
the United States criticize other
governments the same logic has to apply
to our own government we have to live by
the same standards we impose on other
countries it would take too long to list
all his books I'm told there are over
100 of them this is a busy man but I
want to mention a few peace in the
Middle East 1960
for and of course we're still struggling
sorry 1974 okay that was your typo
Michael I believe anyway probably mine
American power and the new mandarins
1969 profit over people 1998 rogue
states 2009 11 and 2002 his productivity
both as a scholar and as a public
intellectual sets a high standard indeed
for the rest of us he is internationally
recognized as one of the most critically
engaged public intellectuals alive today
his writings have literally influenced
millions at age that's a good area in
which to make a numerical error he still
travels the world speaking truth to
power and he is here tonight to do that
I hope after close to 60 years of
intellectual work and 50 years of
political activism he continues to be an
unapologetic critic of both American
foreign policy and its ambitions for
geopolitical hegemony and of the
neoliberal turn of global capitalism
which he identifies in terms of class
warfare waged from above against the
needs and interests of the great
majority Chomsky is also an incisive
critic of the ideological role of the
mainstream corporate mass media which he
maintains manufacturers consent toward
the desirability of the American system
of political economy and the political
powers supportive of it tonight
professor Chomsky will speak about the
conflict that began his involvement in
politics the US war against the people
of Indochina in particular Vietnam the
title of his talk is in the form of a
question the end of the Vietnam War and
the collapse of Empire please join me in
welcoming professor Noam Chomsky
well the question mark at the end of the
title is significant the Vietnam War
technically ended in 1975 so right in
the middle of the decade you're
concerned with and it's commonly assumed
that the were ended then and that that
the u.s. defeat and Vietnam was
initiated the decline or maybe collapse
of the American Empire there are a
couple of things wrong with those
assumptions but one is that the war of
course didn't end it ended for us but
take a walk through the Saigon hospital
today and you'll see that the war didn't
end oh I have to do is look at the rows
of deformed hideously deformed fetuses
that are still appearing as a result of
the ten years of chemical warfare that
John F Kennedy started in 1961 agent
using one of the most carcinogenic
elements known died axon and the effects
are now several generations down because
it has genetic effects that's only one
thing you can walk through regions which
were turned into moonscapes there's many
other effects so for the victims the
wars don't end they may end for the vic
for the the outside aggressor but not
for the victims
the other thing is the second reason for
the question is i think it's it's very
it's it's interesting that it's called
an american defeat what i think actually
happened is and i'll talk about it is
that the United States did not achieve
its maximal aims so it didn't turn
Vietnam into a paradise like Haiti but
so that's but identity that's
major Ames and I'll talk about this and
we know a lot about the major Ames one
good thing about this country is that we
it's very free and open country by
comparative standards we have a huge
record of internal documents fortunately
nobody looks at them so it's only there
if you want to know what's going on but
you're not gonna read about it
the newspapers are even most scholarship
and I so I think it's it's a it's a
partial victory substantial victory as
far as the collapse of American Empire
is concerned I think there's some
questions about that too that is a major
topic of the contemporary discussion and
political and international affairs
circles it's usually there's a more
polite term for it than American Empire
it's called American decline empires
word we use for others not for ourselves
the so it really is a major topic so for
example if you take the major the main
establishment Journal foreign affairs
Journal of the Council on Foreign
Relations the end at the year-end issue
2011 December 2011 take a look at the
front cover it says is America over are
we done for and the lead article there
says well we've got to retrench we've
spent so much money in there an effort
in our humanitarian efforts all over the
world that it's just beyond what we can
manage so we better pulled back you go
back the following year 2012 December
2012 there's the opposite end of the
spectrum an article responding to it
which suggests that we can't really
retrench the world needs us too much
we'd better continue with our benevolent
to do good everywhere that's the range
of discussion and then there's a debate
about what kind of other side stories
about whether China's gonna be the next
I don't either
for what but whatever one thinks about
it the whatever happened in Vietnam did
not initiate the decline which is real
I mean powers getting more diversified
in the world so unfortunately so
relatively speaking American power is
less than it was but but that's been
going on since 1945 the u.s. power
peaked in 1945 the not really in the
history of the United States in the
history of the world there's never been
a power in the history of the world that
was as powerful as the u.s. was in 1945
it had literally half the world's wealth
the Second World War was very beneficial
to the American economy industrial
production practically quadrupled the
country itself of course wasn't hit
competitors were seriously weakened or
completely destroyed and the u.s.
literally had half the world's wealth
the position of overwhelming security
control the whole hemisphere both oceans
oceans and planners during the Second
World War knew it very well
Roosevelt's planners and they laid out
plans for how to run the post-war world
and the plans were pretty much
implemented in the following years they
were not unrealistic the basic plans
were that the US should dominate global
system which would include automatically
the Western Hemisphere that's our back
pocket so yes we of course control the
Western Hemisphere was called our little
region over here which has never
bothered anyone that's Secretary of War
Henry
some part of the posts at World War two
settlement was there wouldn't be any
regional systems but he said well
there's got to be one our little system
over here the Western Hemisphere so that
of course we take we're gonna replace
the British Empire the British Empire
had been the dominant power for
centuries so we'll take over the British
Empire and in fact they'll now be our
client the British were aware of it they
didn't like it if you read the Foreign
Office reports they're pretty upset
about it but there's nothing they could
do so the US was gonna take over the
British Empire or which of course in
particular meant the Middle East energy
supplies that was a crucial part of it
the US would take over the entire Far
East other countries were excluded from
the peace settlement over the East was
of course a peace treaty San Francisco
peace treaty in 1951 a peace treaty with
Japan but the war was defined the
Pacific War was defined as beginning
from 1941 that's rather crucial because
it actually began ten years earlier it's
just that for the preceding 10 years it
was Asians who got massacred so
therefore that didn't count so the war
began with Pearl Harbor and Japanese
crimes were limited to anything that
happened after that other Asian
countries were infuriated by this and
most of them just the ones who had any
degree of Independence just refused to
attend the peace conference the only
ones were attended we're basically
colonies the major countries just
wouldn't come and so nobody was gonna
have a share and running in Japan or the
Far East so we take over the Western
Hemisphere the Far East
former British Empire which of course
was huge and and as much of Eurasia as
was possible personally the commercial
and industrial center of Eurasia Western
Europe and as much more as possible
that was the post-war planning and as I
said was wasn't unrealistic detailed
plans were laid as to how to carry it
out largely implemented but it started
declining right away the first major
decline was in 1949 just four years
later when China had declared
independence though that event has a
very interesting description and us
discourse it's called the loss of China
and a big issue in the United States is
who was responsible for the loss of
China a lot of recriminations
McCarthyism comes out of that and so on
and the phrase itself is never
challenged which is kind of interesting
so for example I can't lose your
computer right I can lose my computer I
can't lose your computer the tacit
assumption is well of course we own
China like we own everything and
therefore if China becomes independent
its the loss of China and that's a huge
issue since from 1949 until today in
fact well the that was concerned right
at the top up by the late 40s it was
pretty clear that it was gonna be pretty
hard to hold on our to our possession
China there was concern that it might be
followed by the loss of Indochina that's
serious the US were supporting France
and its effort to reconquer its former
colony not out of any illusions the US
intelligence State Department understood
very well that Ho Chi Minh leader of the
Vietnamese nationalist movement was the
only person of any
influence the popular support in
Indonesia
Indochina and that was a kind of a
problem because they recognized that any
solution but doesn't include him and yet
men the resistance forces against the
Japanese is not gonna work very well but
nevertheless we had to prevent the loss
of Indochina there were good reasons for
that they were described the planning
was quite sophisticated it's worth
reading the documents the policy
planning staff of the State Department
was the main planning agency that was
headed by George Kennan who's and there
with regard to they assign every region
of the world a function that they were
supposed to carry out there was one
region that the u.s. wasn't much
interested in Africa later decision was
to hand Africa over to the Europeans to
exploit that's his word so that Europe
could exploit Africa for its
reconstruction you can imagine a
different relation between Europe and
Africa considering a couple hundred
years of history but that never crossed
in anyone's mind and if you look at the
scholarship on the topic so that's
Africa Southeast Asia was read was to
fulfill its major function as a source
of raw materials for Japan and Western
Europe that's Southeast Asia and then
comes planning about Indochina which is
mostly quoting if Indochina it's lost
they said Southeast Asia will topple
like a row of dominoes the domino theory
is actually much earlier but it was
resuscitated in this context I should
say that the domino theory is often
ridiculed when the dominoes don't fall
but the reason they don't fall is
overlooked
they don't fall because the us propped
them up with violence so therefore they
didn't fall but the domino theory is all
that was ridiculed it's never questioned
it's over and over right through the
internal record up till the present deep
concern about the domino theory and the
reason is it just makes sense it's a
very rational theory what's gonna make
the dominoes fall well it was understood
that it wouldn't be conquest like it was
resuscitated by Henry Kissinger for a
and this Chile
he described another familiar term was
used the virus that might spread
infection and in fact in general the
it's never military conquest that's
considered what's the mechanism for the
dominoes to a fall as the demonstration
effect what's sometimes called the
threat of a good example so if some poor
country which is suffered miserably say
under colonialism finds a way towards
successful independent development it's
going to appeal to others though they
might try to do the same thing and the
dominoes will start falling the virus
will spread infection and pretty soon
the whole system starts to erode very
rational Theory never questioned in
Southeast Asia one Domino of
considerable importance was Indonesia
Vietnam Indochina they didn't care much
about there was a lot of talk by
Eisenhower and others about its
resources but that was just an effort to
build up some popular support for the
war
it has some resources but not that much
Indonesia is different as very rich
resources and Kenan top planner was
aware of it here's his formulation in
1948 the problem of Indonesia is the
most crucial issue of the moment and our
struggle with the Kremlin but that's the
mantra whatever we're doing 1989 it's to
defend ourselves from Russian aggression
so Indonesia in 1948 was the most
crucial crucial moment in our struggle
with the Kremlin and the reason is that
Indonesia is the anchor in a chain of
islands stretching for Kaido to Sumatra
which we should develop as a
politico-economic counter force to
communism and a base area for possible
military action beyond communist
Indonesia which would be indigenous of
course would be an infection that would
sweep Western westward through all of
South Asia reaching the Middle East
threatening Europe so if Indonesia is
affected by the disease coming from
Vietnam successful development we might
lose everything all the way to Europe
the the tone in the documents is very
much like the business literature
completely paranoid it's remarkably
paranoid if you lose anything you've
lost everything it's like a
three-year-old that's what it's like to
be super powerful you see it in the
business all the time it runs right
through the planning record so if the
virus from Indochina spreads Indonesia
prison will lose Europe that's
as I said Kissinger uses it later for a
yen day and it's common cubit was the
same in the case of Cuba as soon as it
got independence and 1959 immediately
talk starts about the virus it was
explained quite straightforwardly so
arthur schlesinger historian who was
kennedy's advisor and latin american
specialist before kennedy came into
office kennedy had a task force to look
at latin america kissinger ran it and he
recorded back that the problem with
Castro with problem with Cuba is what he
called the Castro idea of taking matters
into your own hands
which will appeal to other countries in
the region that are subject to the same
oppression and colonial repression and
atrocities and maybe they'll try to take
matters into their own hands and that
we're in trouble because the system
starts to collapse right in our backyard
recently after that of course it was all
blamed on the Russians the not always a
couple years later the State Department
pointed out that the problem with Cuba
is what it called its successful
defiance of US policies going back to
the Monroe Doctrine 1823 no Russians
just we're supposed to run the
hemisphere and they're defying us and
they're getting away with it that's
intolerable Michael before the
International for the best way of
thinking about international affairs is
like the Mafia it's very much like the
Mafia I mean if the Godfather doesn't
get paid by say protection money by some
small storekeeper maybe you wouldn't
even notice the money it's pennies but
you can't get a let him get away with it
and you don't just send the goons in to
get the money you sent them in to beat
him to a pulp or kill him so others get
the idea that there's no successful
defiance are allowed in this system
it's quite important and that's how
International Affairs work it's probably
the main one of the very few principles
of international relations theory that
works of course because works to will
but that's approximately well so how
does the virus affect others is a model
that's actually one of the major themes
of post-war history right through all
the way well the concern about Indochina
by the late forties it really reached
colossal worship so there was concern
about the Kremlin inspired memorandum 48
in 1949 it is now clear that Southeast
Asia is the target of a coordinated
offensive directed by the Kremlin and
unless we stop it the effects will be
felt from Australia to the Middle East
the loss of Indochina would undoubtedly
lead to the loss of Southeast Asia and
hence most of the world by the
mechanisms I've just described another
phrase that's commonly used is that the
rot will spread the rot will spread to
Thailand Philippines Indonesia and
finally Japan Japan was sometimes called
the super domino that's the one that
really matters the industrial
technological independent Asian system
and moved to become its industrial
technological center because it's much
more advanced
and that would mean in effect that Japan
would reconstruct what it was trying to
create during the Second World War
let's call the co-prosperity sphere with
Japan at the center everything else part
of the system and that would mean that
the United States have lost the second
world war in the Pacific and in 1949
they were not willing to lose the Second
World War and that was the primary
concern six describe Vietnam as the
cornerstone of the free world in
Southeast Asia the key stone in the arch
the finger in the dike in the
Philippines are threatened if the red
tide of communism overflowed into
Vietnam it's an interesting image -
where's it overflowing from well of
course the Kremlin but reality's a
little different so if it overflows and
moreover the independence of free
Vietnam is crucial to the free world and
fields other than military its political
Liberty is an inspiration to those
seeking to obtain or maintain their
Liberty in all parts of Asia indeed the
world what is this paragon of political
Liberty that he's talking about that
kind of a neo fascist state installed by
the United States very much like Latin
American dictatorships so brutal it was
installed in violation of the Geneva
Accords which we were supposed to settle
the problem with the US wasn't having
that
so they installed a client state which
was so vicious and brutal that by within
the next five or six years had probably
killed 70 or 80 thousand people and that
the brutality inspired resistance
elicited resistance
grew beyond what the client state could
handle so in 1961 Kennedy had to invade
directly that's when it's not called
that of course we'd call it that if
anyone else did it but what happened was
that the resistance had gotten out of
control at the time putting aside the
question whether North Vietnamese have a
right to be in Vietnam let's say they
didn't but because we own it after but
the South Vietnamese resistance was much
too strong government couldn't control
it
Kennedy 1961 authorized the US Air Force
to start bombing South Vietnam as napalm
authorized chemical warfare to destroy
crops incidentally what we call
strategic Hamlet's which are
concentration camps where they're
surrounded by barbed wire to protect
them from the guerrillas at which the US
government knew perfectly well they were
people they were supporting so we drive
him away we kill the crops everywhere
else
I mean well to this day killing there's
a lot of illusions about any kind of
Camelot illusions he's depicted on the
left to as some kind of you know which
may be misled by his advisers or
something it kind of reminds me of
Truman's attitude toward Stalin a Truman
really admired Stalin as late as 1948 a
Truman was saying that Stalin's really a
good guy old Joe as he called him he's
misled by the political but old Joe is
quite different from Mao Zedong Mao
Zedong total monster but old Joe is a
nice guy and the attitude of the left
towards Kennedy is a little bit like
that misled by his advisors our particle
of evidence for it it was at the hawkish
end of his administration right until
the assassination so after the after the
Pigs invasion that failed there was also
history in Washington the Kennedy
launched a major terrorist war one of
the main terrorist wars maybe the main
one of the modern period to to bring the
terrors of the earth to Cuba Arthur
Schlesinger is phrase it was under was
run by his brother Robert Kennedy and it
was his top priority was to bring the
terrors of the earth to Cuba there was
no joke very serious terrorist war that
the first book reviewing the effect on
Cubans oral history just appeared by a
Canadian researcher United States but
that's the first one major war kennedy
had to call it off when the missile
crisis came that practically blew up the
world since the missile crisis was over
he reintroduced it and the terror
continued in fact it was continuing
there was a terrorist act planned right
on the day of his assassination so these
are all total illusions
I mean if Kennedy had wanted to get out
of Vietnam
nothing easier a couple of months before
his assassination US intelligence
discovered that the u.s. client and his
brother we're making a deal we're
negotiating with the north to try to end
the conflict by some sort of negotiated
settlement so if you want to get out
that's perfect they were gonna make a
negotiated settlement ask the u.s.
believe tone extended to China - they're
very interesting there's a bottom line
China's the world the premises that lead
to it keep changing so in the early
years it's the worst thing in the world
because it's a Soviet puppet couple
years later was practically war with the
Russians so it's the worst place in the
world because it's independent of the
Russian and it's carrying out a Wars of
national liberation in opposition to the
moderate Russians and so on so the
arguments are interesting same
conclusion always assumptions keep
changing but the conclusion is what you
need like cannons
20 25 years of intelligence documents
are in their unusual collection of
documents you get sometimes from a
country when you conquer it and capture
its archives
these are usually not things that are
released and there's some interesting
things there one of the most interesting
things in the Pentagon Papers is that in
this entire 25 years there is one staff
paper never even submitted which raises
the question whether Hanoi and China are
following their own national objectives
or whether they're just clients which is
paid sort of to get the facts straight
not just to produce propaganda you
couldn't ask the question the religion
is so profound so deeply rooted that the
question can't even be asked it's a
pretty remarkable fact of an American
culture which is up here incidentally
it's I don't think there's ever
discussed in the intelligence did try
from the late 40s to try to find some
evidence that Hanoi was being controlled
by you couldn't even ask about the
National Liberation Front they were not
supposed to exist
you could ask whether Hanoi was being
directed by China or Russia had to be
one of the other or maybe the sign of
Soviet conspiracy there were three
possibilities it had to be one of the
other an intelligence really worked hard
to try to find some evidence for it they
once they thought they had found
that North Vietnam is the only place in
Southeast Asia where there's no
connection to the Russians or the
Chinese and then they threw the obvious
conclusion they both know that ho chi
minh is such a loyal subject that they
don't even have to give him directions
so this proves the thesis that he's a
total slave took care of that by the mid
sixties the war was escalated the most
respected historian Robert McNamara's
memoir Secretary of Defense in 1967 fall
wrote Vietnam as a cultural and historic
entity is threatened with extinction
while in the South the countryside
literally dies under the blows of the
largest military machine ever unleashed
on an area of this size which he feared
might prevail that's very interesting to
read McNamara's reaction to that he
quotes it and he says well fall was
becoming optimistic he was becoming
optimistic that the United States would
win before that he wasn't sure but now
he's becoming optimistic because we've
destroyed the country so totally it's
going to disappear so that was very kind
of a share of his cheerful news in
Washington McNamara's regards and of
incidentally this book is well how do
you deal with the virus and spreading
infection straightforward you kill the
virus
you inoculate the potential victims
so you destroy the virus and you install
vicious military dictatorships all
around so they don't get infected
and that's the way it's done
consistently so in the case of Vietnam
Vietnam was pretty much destroyed
couldn't totally wipe it out but it's
never gonna be a model for anyone the
idea that will be a successful model
that will spread the virus of
Independence that was finished by the
early sixties in fact all the
surrounding countries the u.s. imposed
the same was done in the case of Cuba
remember Cuba what's going on at the
same time the United States a global
power it's usually doing the same thing
in different parts of the world this is
ignored in commentary and scholarship by
specialization so there's some people
who study Vietnam and there's some other
people who study Cuba there's some other
people who study the Middle East but
nobody studies the United States we
don't make that mistake when we're
studying Russian domination but here
this is crucial because the United
States is a benign confused actor
doesn't quite know what it's doing makes
mistakes and so on but all the same
things are happening all over the world
mr. supposed to be it's not even noticed
but so take Cuba Cuba was about the same
time as South Vietnam
50 years of harsh sanctions strongly
opposed by the whole world including all
of Latin America with the making
difference but the point is to keep it
from succeeding and and the surrounding
region was surrounded by dictatorships
first this is under Kennedy beginning
with Kennedy the first one was Brazil
the most important country military
dictatorship was installed right after
these Kennedy's assassination it was
actually planned during his
administration kind of a neo-nazi
national security state torture killing
murder and so on and then it just spread
Chile was one case the dominoes fell by
the 1980s reached Central America under
Reagan sadistic atrocities hundreds of
thousands of people killed no hope of
any virus or spreading from there
immediately there's time I go into it
but the point is it's consistent it's
perfect than the same was going on in
the Middle East it's in any way the
virus was destroyed the surrounding
countries do something about Japan
because we were taking away its
co-prosperity sphere the answer was as
Kenan put it to give Japan what he
called a co-prosperity sphere that is to
give Japan exactly what it was asked
co-prosperity sphere an empire toward
the south as canon called it but under
our control so then it's okay you know
we as long as we're in control of the
whole thing really doesn't matter so
that was done and by now the rest of
Asia is being lost same in Latin America
worked for a long time horrible
repression atrocities crimes last ten
years Latin America has totally broken
from us control significance that's very
dramatic one example just showed up a
couple days ago you may have seen the
open society forum I just published a
report interesting report on rendition
rendition is if you have a suspect you
don't want to be caught torturing them
yourself you send them to some state
like Syria or some Libya under Qaddafi
and make sure they'll get tortured there
other countries have to participate so
the study was which countries
participated in the u.s. rendition
program global torture program well it
turns out there's a map every area of
the world Latin America was the backyard
they did what we said furthermore Latin
America was the torture center of the
world and the from Kennedy up through up
to this millennium as the u.s. installed
these torture states but they're missing
the last 10 years they're free of it
many other
more evidence well let's go back to the
post-war period under hawks say it was a
noble cause we tried harder we could
have won
we were stabbed in the back the Dove say
it was a noble cause but we just it was
just too costly for us so for example
Anthony Lewis way at the extreme left of
critical commentary in the media the
u.s. effort began under benign efforts
it was too costly for us we couldn't
bring democracy and freedom to Vietnam
at a cost acceptable to ourselves so it
was a real mistake that's that's the
spectrum you get to see it with the
president
so 1975 the war technically ended the
Carter came into office human rights
president he was asked right away 1977
whether he thought we owe something to
the Vietnamese after what happened and
Carter answered we Oviatt Nam no bit
because the destruction was mutual
okay it was walk through that's the
extreme the next President Carter it was
just a noble cause you got the George
Bush the first at the reasonable bush
you know the one we're supposed to
admire
he was willing to so we'll forgive you
against us if you devote all your
resources to the spectrum but it's
critical of it so it's called it's
critical because the Pentagon refused to
recognize that it was futile it wasn't
it was creating enemies faster than it
was killing people it's kind of like the
drone attacks so it's futile
therefore it was wrong
kind of like what Nazi generals that
would have said after Stalingrad second
front was just stupid
you know shoulda knocked off England
first then it would have been great
well that's the dovish extreme and
scholarship what about the Empire
one way to understand what US planning
has been about since the Second World
War is to take a look at what happened
when the the great enemy disappeared
1989 okay no more Russians so what
happens well what happens is kind of
interesting this was the bush number one
administration they immediately produced
national security strategy basically
it's everything exactly like as before
but with new pretext so we have to
maintain a huge military system you're
not supposed to laugh because of the
technological sophistication of third
world powers literally if you're
well-educated intellectual you don't
laugh and nobody live so we have to
maintain what he called what they called
the defense industrial base that's a
euphemism for high-tech industry the
public has to pay the costs of advanced
industry Steve Jobs Bill Gates can make
the profits but first it has to be in
the state system for decades where they
creative hard work is done so we have to
keep the defense industrial base
particularly interesting was what they
said about the Middle East us
massive intervention forces aimed at the
Middle East and said we have to maintain
these intervention forces aimed at the
Middle East was an interesting phrase
where the serious problems we faced
could not have been laid at the
Kremlin's door so in other words excuse
us we've been lying to you for 60 years
nationalism of course it always was it's
declining it's been declining since 1945
of the world's getting more diverse deep
concern about the Arab Spring
particularly about the possible threat
of democracy was it the Middle East
might be lost
but that's been stemmed for the time
being so maybe that won't be but it is
diversifying no question about it so I
have sort of an economic question you
hear all kinds of stuff about jobs these
days I've listened to a couple here
talks on CD where you talk about a
couple things
one where you talk about the mill hands
and Lowell and how they complained
bitterly as they are forced into
factories off the farms and the values
that they fought for in the
Revolutionary War were taken away and
they felt like they're just turned into
wage slaves and in another talk you talk
about trade and world trade and how like
99 percent of it is just speculation it
may be only 1% is tangible goods so
given that would you
sitted jobs are the solution or part of
the problem did you get that did you say
their jobs were the solution or part of
the problem tiny corporate naturally
don't really care about what they care
about is the threat
there's one way to create the man and
that's for the government to create it
and that means increasing the deficit
increasing the deficit will improve the
economy by creating demand and then even
better than that as stimulus spending so
that's a way to deal with the
joblessness program and in fact
particularly exotic suggestion so the
business press suggested for example
I'm from Halifax Nova Scotia Canada and
I'm bringing gratitude from thousands of
acted activists across our country thank
you so much for your important work and
I'm very sorry about our conservative
Harper government my question is I'm
wondering if you can share your thoughts
about this new asia-pacific pivot and
the planned naval base between South
Korea and the United States
to counter the threat its described in
the humiliation century
I'm sorry but so yes there's that
conflict with Japanese islands and this
content and if you look at the Southeast
Asian countries they're not happy about
China's power for very good reasons it's
quite interesting that US planners knew
this in the 1960s while they were raving
about the China
you know expanding over the world they
considered the what would happen one of
the options that was considered was to
leave Vietnam alone that let it be
unified and then they said it will
resume its traditional hostility to
China okay
but that wasn't considered an option I
mean they understood this old hostility
going back thousand years and could tell
you more about it I don't go on too long
but but yes so there's a pivot to Asia
which could be serious you know however
they're the interactions between China
and the United States are so dense by
now it's it's not means clear it'll lead
to a military confrontation I I want to
ask you about this new bipartisan policy
that both parties in the United States
has in regards to the drone attacks and
entering the airspace of other countries
illegally to do this drone attacks and
killed on citizens especially if there
are American citizens sort of like the
license to kill and and if you think
that there's any possibility said there
be able to overturn this either you know
through the Supreme Court or through
public outrage because currently there's
you know both parties I've taken it for
granted that this is something that
they're allowed to do this is the
question of comment on the bipartisan
agreement in support of the drone
attacks which are killing innocent
civilians all over the world including
American citizens and do you think that
there's any possibility either through
public outrage or the supreme court or
some other mechanism that we within the
United States can stop this from
happening about a fair reproduction of
the question yeah well the drone attacks
are simply a global assassination
campaign there used to be something in
anglo-american law which goes back to
the 13th century Magna Carta which is
called presumption of innocence means a
person is innocent until proven guilty
under due process by a jury of his peers
that's thirteenth century it's in the
American Constitution fifth and sixth
amendments that's been almost totally
abandoned that's the foundation of
anglo-american law it's completely
forgotten you take a look at the
planning for the drone attacks it's been
public about it when the what happens is
Obama and his national security adviser
Brennan they get together in the morning
Brennan is a former priest so they read
some passages from st. Augustine about
and then after that they decide who
they're gonna kill today criteria they
make it clear the criteria are pretty
loose I mean if a group of men are seen
or found together somewhere you know
loading a truck you can kill them
because they might be terrorists and
Holder was asked for what about due
process they said well with there is due
process we talked about it and the
executive branch I mean the kings of
aland England in the 13th century would
have been delighted yeah this notion of
due process and it's all over so you're
not going to get anything in the Supreme
Court especially they very reactionary
Supreme Court there is bipartisan
agreement the reason is it's pretty
cheap doesn't you know doesn't there is
some problem about harm to Americans
there's now concerned that the people
who you may have read this that the
people who sit at the computers and
control the drones they're having some
psychological problems when a jet
fighter that goes over some village and
drops bombs it goes away right so they
don't see what they're doing but these
guys the drought is circling around you
know it bombs someplace they see pieces
of bodies flying all over the place
children killed and so on it's hard for
them so they're having psychological
problems and there are now programs
being initiated to deal with the hard
psychological problems facing but the
guys and the computers and you know Las
Vegas or wherever they are so there's
some cost to the United States but
they're not really serious ones it's a
cheap way of killing a lot of people is
it like the chemical warfare a futile
maybe it seems to be probably creating
potential terrorists faster than it's
killing somebody we don't like but you
know a protection against terrorists and
never been a high priority for the US or
other governments it's easy to show so
there's bipartisan agreement that's true
and it'll probably continue as I'm sure
you all know especially those arguing
criminal justice it's expanding
domestically to domestic surveillance to
going after people you don't like here
probably on the same conditions
especially under Obama
increase in domestic surveillance
tearing the shreds
American Civil Liberties but there's
bipartisan agreement it's only harming
the mass of the population like the
focus on the deficit but that's minor
significance so yes it can be stopped
but it's gonna have to be massive
popular action like finally what finally
happened to the Vietnam War actually one
of the most interesting parts of the
Pentagon Papers which is never commented
on again too interesting is their very
last part very end it ends the Pentagon
Papers ends in mid-1968 in January 1968
there was an incredible uprising in
South Vietnam it's called the Tet
Offensive wasn't an offensive it was
just a massive uprising all over the
country
it was pretty astonishing because the
whole country was penetrated with spies
soldiers everything and nobody knew
anything about it it was kept secret and
suddenly burst out and the US could
barely control it it's never described
that way of course but that's what it
was that was of great concern here
because it showed that it's not gonna be
easy to gain a military victory we've
got an opposition in the country which
is so deeply rooted it's gonna be hard
Johnson was then president and he wanted
to send a couple hundred thousand more
troops to Vietnam but the Joint Chiefs
were opposed to it because they said
that the troops are gonna be needed for
civil disorder control in the United
States if we send them there's going to
be an uprising in the United States
among young people women others and
we're just gonna need troops to control
them so they didn't want to send the
troops and that's a good indication of
the impact that the anti-war movement
was having didn't end the war but it
constrained it you know meant they there
were things they could have done that
they didn't do so I can't have effect
and drones also if there's a big popular
how's it going professor for all the
folks in the in the audience who are who
are trying to get their hands on some
more truth what would you give them
advice wise in regards to continuous
pressures from the government with
censorship that come along with you know
the Stop Online Piracy Act as well as
other legislative proposals always the
same advice there's no secret there's
been a lot of progress over the last
couple centuries even the last
generation always works the same way it
comes from the pressure of organized
popular movements if they reach enough
scale so-called leaders emerge and
sometimes it reaches legislation and
some changes are introduced and if you
keep it up you can keep going everything
just take the last generation there have
been improvements I mean the women's
movement the environmental movement the
anti-war movement something about civil
and minority rights not enough but some
everything you look at it's the same
that's the way it worked and if there's
another way it's never been discovered
somebody who listened to that advice I
think the most important thing is never
give up because there are losses and
there are backslidings but you do see
that there have been times in history
where progress has been made and so the
point is not to give up no matter how
hard it looks one word that another
thing we're not allowed to say this if
you don't mind they'll say is that
that's one lesson that the old Communist
Party no you take a look over many years
the Communist Party was almost always in
the forefront of human rights activities
civil rights activities opposition to
war and so on and part of the reason was
just what Michael said they knew that
it's gonna be a long struggle we can't
just quit after one try and in fact
there always was somebody around who
remembered how to turn the mimeograph
machines and how to organize a
demonstration and so on in our society
the way it's a very kind of instrument
gratification society if you don't get
what you want quickly you stop and the
next time you start all the lessons have
to be learned over again from scratch
that is not effective it's made some
achievements but you really have to have
staying power Michael I had one question
under the theme of the decline of Empire
sorry one question under the theme of
decline of Empire which is what
prospects do you see now for integration
of states among the global South from
Latin America to Africa and Southeast
Asia and how hopeful are you of States
or politicians that are showing some
signs of rejection towards us hegemony
could you hear yeah that's taking place
and it's quite interesting so there's a
there are groupings forming of the
global self the best-known one is what's
called the BRICS Brazil Russia India
China and South Africa which have been
working together they come out with
policy proposals
sometimes they achieve something the
West doesn't like them of course so for
example in the bombing of Libya take the
bombing of Libya an interesting case
what's claimed is the international
community supported the bombing of Libya
okay who's the international community
well turns out to be the United States
anyone who happens to agree with it at
that
and not the world if you look at the
bombing of Libya
it was the three traditional imperial
powers France Britain in the United
States almost nobody else
Libya's in the BRICS countries happened
to be meeting at that time in China
somewhere and they came out with a
strong statement calling for negotiation
ago she ations attempt at a political
settlement which would head off the
likely humanitarian crisis which in fact
took place they weren't alone the
African Union took exactly the same
positions in African country the
non-aligned movement which is most of
the world but that position
Germany wouldn't go along even in NATO a
turkey at the beginning joined the rest
of the world they finally shifted over
to the Imperial camp when they saw was
happening anyway but the BRICS had a
position that it's true in other cases
too and they can do some things you know
it's a growing force and that's not the
only one
as I said Latin America is Latin America
is moving towards integration for the
first time there was very striking
development and about a year ago there
was a hemispheric conference in Colombia
Cartagena Colombia conference the whole
hemisphere and there were two issues
that came up they could never come out
with a statement because there was no
consensus on the two issues one issue
was allowing Cuba in the other issue was
moving towards decriminalizing drugs and
there were two holdouts on both issues
Canada and the United States they're
almost out of the hemisphere by now if
there's another meeting I suspect
they'll be excluded in fact there
already is the inform of an organization
tzedakah it's cold which was formed the
venezuela which includes every country
of the hemisphere except the united
states and canada and if that becomes
more than a form could be meaningful
within South America itself there's a
couple of integrated systems that have
developed one is unas or the Union of
South American republics I guess which
has already taken some positions so like
they supported Bolivia when it was under
attack by US backed right-wing elites
remember Latin America the traditional
set up in Latin America is a lot of
resources a lot of potential wealth but
horrible misery they're mostly run by
small elite Europeanized often white
they kind of run the place and their
orientation is towards the west they
don't care about their countries and
that's what happened in Bolivia the old
white elite tried to overthrow the
government the US was backing it of
course una so removed in right away
supported the president Morales and that
say you know those are things that are
beginning to happen I think you're gonna
see more and more I think we are going
to have one more question over here I do
apologize but professor Chomsky got on a
plane in Boston this morning at 2:30
just to come to John Jay and he's got a
plane to catch to get back to Boston
tonight so one more question go for it a
lot of pressure
I'll try and ask one that spans the 5060
years that you've been talking about
when you were talking in the 50s when
you're talking in the 60s you made the
linkage on the the concept of the domino
theory and tied it to state models
viruses and such when I was growing up
during that period much more of the
comment about the domino theory was
meddling you know the Communists are
gonna meddle they're gonna put their
people in place in the various countries
but there was Laos Cambodia and such
just wondered whether that was in fact
going on
i meanwhat at the same point where we
were trying the US trying was trying to
put our puppets in variety of places
weather was South America or Southeast
Asia I was wondering whether whether
Russia and/or Communist China we're
trying to do the same at the time and
bring it forward sort of full tilt where
do you see or do you see those three
regimes actually doing the old-fashioned
covert meddling to sort of put their
their people in power now so maybe you
can sort of cover that broadly the idea
was that is it possible that as people
were talking about the domino theory
that maybe there was some meddling you
know mev DL ing by China and the Soviet
Union in certain countries to try to
make them friends and is it possible
that the new Russia the new China as
well as the United States might be doing
some meddling with other countries today
well China was has not been an imperial
power really maybe and maybe that will
happen in the future you know but if you
look at all of Chinese history it's
never really happened thousands of years
they had tributaries so you know a lot
of the region was a domme dominated by
China I mentioned Okinawa but a lot of
countries paid tribute to China the
center of the world
you know the barbarians paid tribute but
it hasn't really been an imperial power
and the European sense and it isn't now
either of course it's meddling all over
the place but in its own way like in
like take Libya again which I mentioned
China had a lot of investments in Libya
they had tens of thousands of Chinese
technicians there trying to develop
Libyan oil supplies they had to flee
when the bombing started and I suspect
that one of the reasons for the bombing
was to get the Chinese out and they're
not nice guys like when they move into
Africa they're just as exploitative and
harsh as anyone else but it's not
military
rusha let's go back to Russia that's
more interesting case because at the end
of the Second World War there was there
was a settlement Russia was took over
Eastern Europe right up to East Germany
and the u.s. essentially took over the
rest if you look at the actual events of
the Cold War not the you know not the
rhetoric the cold it pretty well capture
the events of the Cold War by observing
that it was a kind of a tacit compact
between the two superpowers not to
attack each other that was too dangerous
happened once the Missile Crisis but
basically leave each other alone and
each one will be free to intervene in
its own domains for Russia Eastern
Europe for the United States most of the
rest of the world those are the events
of the Cold War and that's what it's
about
there's an asymmetry of course and the
asymmetry had to do with the relative
power of Russia in the United States
Russia is much weaker there's another
asymmetry for eastern this is not to
rush it was pretty harsh and Eastern
Europe you know the Hungarian Revolution
was brutally suppressed the Czech
independence and so on on the other hand
Russia had a real concern this is the
invasion route through which Russia had
almost been destroyed three times in the
century right the United States has
never been invaded through Central
America so for it was quite a
symmetrical another asymmetry is that in
order to keep Eastern Europe under
control the Russia basically subsidized
it it was actually been pointed out that
Russia is a unique Empire in history and
that its colonies were richer than it
was so the Eastern European countries
were actually better off than Russia
not because there are nice guys but they
wanted to make sure that this region it
was under control it's a very sensitive
region for them so yes they meddled
there they you could say they meddled
elsewhere so for example when the US was
bombing North Vietnam Russia gave
defensive weapons to the Russians to
Hanoi which did shoot down American
bombers bombing North Vietnam that's the
moral problem that George Bush was
talking about in the case of Cuba after
the u.s. invade you know Pigs terror and
so on the Russians provided substantial
work to Cuba up until the collapse of
the Soviet Union and essentially the way
the US reacted after that collapse the
u.s. reacted by immediately making the
escalating the attack on Cuba no more
Russians right they're pulling out so
what do we do we have harsher sanctions
they were introduced by the Democrats
incidentally George Bush the president
was gonna veto them but he was
outflanked from the right by Bill
Clinton torch name torch Shelley I think
the New Jersey senator Democrat they
wanted harsher sanctions because now we
got him by the throat let's strangle
them but they somehow survived and other
things like then and you know you could
say the u.s. meddled in Eastern Europe
much like didn't sponsor revolutions but
it spread propaganda you know tried to
support uprisings and things you know so
there's something like that but the real
meddling and it's an understatement is
within their own domains and that was a
real horror story actually was worse
than us domains than in Eastern Europe
at least after Stalin's death
