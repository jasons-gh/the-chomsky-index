what's interesting about how businesses
use use their propaganda for I would see
now more so these propaganda more so
sorry um for union busting well now
union but I mean for a while after the
Second World War when the was strong
support for labor and there was rather
radical society in many ways this was
done subtly but since Reagan it's just
done openly I'm in Reagan but you know I
don't know if you had an idea in his
head but what we call Reagan namely his
administration bitterly hated unions and
one of them destroyed began with the you
know the air-controllers strike and went
on from there so during the Reagan years
the administration has told the business
world taco enforce the labor was and the
number of illegal firings tripled during
the Reagan years you read that in
Business Week which was pretty happy
about it and you know it's at that time
that you start getting these companies
that are specialized that specialize in
how to destroy unions and they're quite
public they don't make it secret and
they have all sorts techniques for
management to destroy unions well when
Clinton came along it sort of moderated
a little bit but Clinton had a different
device for breaking unions called a
NAFTA because the government was
entirely lawless employers could exploit
after to threaten union organizers with
transfer it's illegal but when you've
got a lawless government doesn't matter
if it's illegal and I think the number
of Union drives blocked increased by
about fifty percent just using NAFTA's
and illegal tactic destroy unions
actually the study of this
then under NAFTA auspices part of the
NAFTA legislation required studies of
labor practices and quite a good study
that came out but its labor historian at
Cornell his name escapes me at the
moment on labor pregnant on the use of
NAFTA to undermine and destroy unions
well that was going on in the Clinton
years and of course bush I need to talk
about but starting with Reagan it became
quite open you know the attack on unions
I mean it wasn't Pinkertons anymore but
it was just not applying the lows either
seeing that very much in the house of UW
a session with starbucks and prisoners
and stay where starbucks will without
all kinds of Anton propaganda both
internally within the company and
externally a lot of it is is town
workers they don't need a union better
off without it that's the whole foods
mine stability and if a lot of it is I
was actually very effective to touch me
now and so one of my burning questions
for you was um how could we as a small
independent labor
you work to fight against that kind of
propaganda just gotta get people
organized and tell them the truth there
aren't any magic tricks to it but
sometimes it's pretty amazing actually i
mentioned i think in that same article
you mentioned i imagine one pretty
striking case that was the caterpillar
case a caterpillar was quite important
because that was the first manufacturing
industry that used Reaganite to strike
baking techniques called in scabs which
happened to be illegal the matter in
lawless state called in scabs to break a
major strike I was in my early 90s I
think but and there was there were
reports of it a mission it was reported
pretty well in Chicago Tribune very
often the business press has much better
labor reporting than anything else and
the Chicago trib had good stories about
it i quoted some of them and they
pointed out something very interesting
they said that the workers gotta live a
very little support and I think it was
Peoria when scabs illegally broke the
strike and I was particularly striking
because that whole community been built
up by the union was a union based
community which they had that created
the community it was the workforce they
won many rights but when it came to the
crunch the community itself didn't
support them that's kind of it's kind of
interesting about obama because obama
was a community organizer supposedly in
chicago at that time I'm sure he read
the Chicago Tribune so he knew about it
but when he went to show his solidarity
with the workforce first place I went
was quatre bill thanks I don't think
he's forgotten and the labor movement
didn't react even radical labor
historians didn't remember
remember talking to a couple of them
pointing it out because it's been wiped
out of consciousness it's only 15 years
after its a real triumph of propaganda
to in many ways and yeah it's a lot of
work to reconstruct it's happened before
I'm in the 1920s the labor movement was
almost completely destroyed you know a
foreign visitors I'm even the right-wing
British press was writing articles I
can't believe that workers are treated
in the United States and it looked as if
but it is a book by david montgomery a
very good labor historian it's called
the rise and fall of labor or something
and the fall of labor that he's talking
about is the 1920s well you know the
1930s it really revived and became
pretty radical ok things can happen but
not by themselves I mean then you had
the Communist Party on whatever you
think about the Communist Party
nevertheless they were the right at the
heart of a civil rights activism labour
activism and so on and without that it's
something else has to provide it and you
don't want to have their Russia worship
but domestically they have pretty good
record can remember it pretty well from
childhood my family wasn't they were
mostly Union you know Union people
your father was your thought he was only
iww bish you wanna know the truth you
went of the truth he came over as an
immigrant didn't know any English got
wit the work and switch up in Baltimore
and he told me they told me later he
didn't really know English but this guy
was coming around he seemed to be for
the workers so he signed up was an IWW
organizer he didn't regret it he just
really didn't know warden don't even
know if I ever knew victims I'm switch
over I do with my other relatives some
of the women were garment workers union
men were shopping for that with a base
in New England
well this was New York me I hadn't been
fooled of it but the family was new year
and you can see I could see what the
union was doing for them I'm it really
saved their lives i had to aunt Spence
Spencer Spencer aunts who were in the
seamstresses and of course unemployed
and theories that the Union gave him a
life I mean they had a couple of weeks
in the country in a union installation
they had educational programs all sorts
of things it was there was a life you
know a real community and that you know
they were members the Communist Party
but they didn't care one way or another
about Russia's care about the United
States
