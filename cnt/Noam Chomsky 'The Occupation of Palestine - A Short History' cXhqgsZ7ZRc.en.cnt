I've been asked to say a few words and
I'll try to keep it to a few words on on
the the occupation just meaning the
occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip but I'll keep that omit the Golan
Heights separate but important issue
just to let you know where I stand on
the matter
so no confusion of the I think there is
a possibility now of a diplomatic
settlement pretty much in accord with
what has been a very long-standing and
extremely broad international consensus
since the mid-1970s namely to state
settlement on they recognized
international border with minor
modifications that has not been possible
for one reason because the United States
has been blocking it since the mid-1970s
and continues to block it but that much
is in our hands
so that could change about two-thirds of
the population has supports it but has
no effect on policy the one formulation
of that there are various formulations
of this proposal one of them the most
reasonable one on the table I think is
the so-called Geneva Accords being
discussed in Geneva right now most of
the relevant countries have lent support
to it the u.s. is notable by its absence
as usual and the in my view this is I'm
not suggesting it's a wonderful
agreement I don't think it is I think
it's the least unpleasant of the
realistic alternative at least for the
short term maybe can lead to something
better later on but that's just so you
know where I stand and you can
triangulate as you like the I will
review briefly that's all
do in fact some of the steps leading up
to this for many of you this should be
familiar in fact for everyone it should
be something you learn about in
elementary school so I apologize for
saying things that should be at least
well known and wouldn't be if we value
their freedom but unfortunately are not
well known in fact barely known so let
me quickly review as I said by occupied
territories I will refer to take as a
starting point the Internet the
effective international border as it was
settled in 1949 that border it's called
the Green Line divides the Palestinian
state that was recommended and at the UN
resolution in two years earlier it
divides it roughly into almost exactly
into a half of it was taken over by
Israel that part is called Israel and
it's not under contention the other half
was taken over by Jordan that's what's
called the West Bank and that's the part
that's under contention so that
partition is essentially finished as far
as the international community's
concerned and it's not debated the the
border stayed that way until 1908 in
1956 but was compelled by the u.s. to
withdraw in 1967 Israel again invaded
this time with us support and conquered
the Sinai the West Bank
and the Golan Heights that's the
situation as it is now what I'm
referring to now as the occupied
territories again are the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip the next in November 1967
the Security Council
accepted a us initiated resolution UN
242 which called for a settlement on the
international border on the green line
with in the US official version with
minor and mutual adjustments but
essentially on the Green Line
so maybe straighten out a curve board or
something like that that was the u.s.
position it was adopted by essentially
the world notice that that resolution
was completely rejectionist
it said nothing about Palestinian rights
there I mentioned the only reference to
Palestinian is of a Palestinians is a
vague illusion to unspecified rights of
refugees that remain at that time in
1967 the resolution was it called
essentially for peace for peace treaty
in return for a full withdrawal minor
modifications and mutual ones Israel
rejected that withdrawal the major Arab
states rejected peace things were to
stand still until 1971 when Egypt broke
the ice by offering Israel at a full
peace treaty complete peace treaty in
terms of official US policy in return
not for withdrawal but for partial
withdrawal that is withdrawal from
Egyptian territory the Egyptian offer
says nothing about the West Bank about
the Palestinians at the Golan Heights it
said in return for withdrawal from
Egyptian territory Egypt would accept
the full peace treaty Israel Egypt is
the major military force in the Arab
world with Egypt out of the conflict
conflict the military aspect of the
conflict would have essentially been
over Israel understood that we have the
lot of Israeli internal documents from
the period as some of them secret than
some public and they're consistent they
understood that there could be
peace at this point and integration into
the region but Israel decided to reject
the offer on because they preferred
expansion expansion at that time meant
into the Sinai that was the crucial area
Israel was a missive Labour government
called the mayor Labour government was
expanding into the northeast Sinai from
which thousands of farmers had been
expelled driven into the desert behind
barbed wire their towns mosques and so
on leveled in preparation for the
building of an altruist city called yum
eat which was a major project at the
time the crucial question was how the
United States would react as always the
United States is one astute Israeli
commentator one of their major political
commentators really just recently
described this the boss man called the
partner which is essentially accurate so
the question is how the boss man called
partner would react the boss man had an
internal debate it was won by Henry
Kissinger and the US government decided
to abandon its former position and
accept Israel's position and to follow
what Kissinger called a policy of
stalemate a stalemate means no
negotiations just force that ended the
Egyptian initiative actually Egypt
continued to put it forward in every way
it could the president President Sadat
of Egypt who initiated it warned
repeatedly that if Israel continued
expanding into the Sinai with us backing
he would go to war and his phrase yummy
means war nobody took him very seriously
it was a period of enormous triumphalism
both Israel in the United States Egypt
was assumed to be a basket case and it
was just disregarded in 1973 to
everyone's astonishment Egypt that
didn't go to war and everyone was
greater astonishment turned out to be
militarily highly successful it was a
very close thing for Israel in fact for
the world the United States declared a
nuclear alert and it was pretty tense
for put a minute superpower conflict
meaning the end at that point
Kissinger recognized that Egypt can't
simply be dismissed and he initiated
what was called his shuttle diplomacy
moving back and trying to arrange some
sort of ceasefire without going through
the details that led finally to the Camp
David agreements of 1978 in which the
United States and Israel accepted
so that's 1971 offer the at that point
the author was much less acceptable to
the US and Israel than it would have
been in 1971 because by then the
Palestinian issue was on the table so
the Lucid offer in 1978 was that Israel
Egypt would make peace with Israel if
Israel withdrew from the from Egyptian
territory Sinai and also a recognized
Palestinian rights that was new 1971 the
way this is described in the United
States it's called and in fact in the
West thanks to the power of u.s.
propaganda it's described as a
diplomatic triumph of the United States
in fact Carter President Carter just got
a Nobel Peace Prize for it recently
actually was a diplomatic TAS trophy for
the United States it was an acceptance
of a harsher version from their point of
view of an offer that was on the table
in 1971 which Washington had rejected
leading to
major war almost destruction years of
tragedy and torture and finally the u.s.
came around and accepted it but history
is written by the by the victors and the
powerful doesn't necessarily have much
relationship to what happened you can
check and see if you agree that that's
what happened and there's not really any
controversy the documentary record is
very straightforward the by 1978 as I
mentioned by then by 1978 the
Palestinian issue was on the table that
reached the international agenda on in
1976 January 1976 when the Security
Council debated a resolution calling for
a political settlement on the
international border with but now
different from UN 242 because it called
for a Palestinian state in the
territories that Israel would evacuate
the West Bank and the there was a very
broad very broad international support
for that supported by all the Arab
states major Arab states by the PLO in
fact pretty much by the whole world the
u.s. vetoed a u.s. veto typically is a
double veto it doesn't happen and it's
vetoed from history so to find out about
it that was the first overt u.s. step to
block the international consensus which
still persists same international
consensus same blocking by and nineteen
I won't run through the rest of the
record but from that point until the
present the United States has continued
to intervene and laterally vetoing
Security Council resolutions voting
against similar General Assembly
resolution
usually alone alone means with Israel
sometimes with you know the Marshall
Islands or someone else's picked up but
essentially unilaterally and has also
blocked all other initiatives they've
been a whole series of diplomatic
initiatives all blocked by Washington
that continues to the president in 1991
just to move to the next step in the
diplomacy after the first Gulf War the
u.s. felt that it was in a position to
it had made it clear in the first world
Gulf War that the US was going to
dominate that region by force everybody
else understood everybody backed off the
US was in a position to ram through its
own unilateral agreement so it assumed
the Madrid conference right after the
Gulf War was called to institute the
u.s. position there was however a snag
there was a Palestinian there was an
authentic Palestinian delegation headed
by the most respected figure in the
occupied territories Hyder Abdul Raffi a
conservative nationalist honest renowned
for his integrity and highly respected
and he simply refused to go along he
headed the Palestinian negotiation team
and they simply refused to accept the
us-israeli demand that a settlement a
political settlement permit continued
Israeli us-backed Israeli moves to to
settle and integrate as much of the
occupied territories as they wanted
that's that was the weight on which the
negotiations blocked they got around
that thanks to the Palestinian
leadership outside Palestine it's called
the Tunis leadership the PLO and yes
there are who decided to undercut the
Palestinian negotiating
team and agree to a political
arrangement which would permit continued
Israeli settlement that means us funded
and Bank Israeli settlements in the
occupied territories and further
integration of building infrastructure
and so on that was called the Oslo
agreement highly praised here grant
meeting on the White House lawn the day
of if you read the terms of the Oslo
agreement the Declaration of Principles
it was completely obvious what was
happening the terms did refer to UN 242
but they left out all other UN
resolutions which called for Palestinian
national rights
remember UN 242 is completely
rejectionist
nothing about the Palestinians so the
Declaration of Principles described the
permanent settlement the long-term
settlement that they were going to reach
as based solely on UN 242 and suffering
nothing to the Palestinians and there
was nothing in it about any bar to
continued us back integration programs
and the occupied territories the the
Palestinians did have a role the
Palestinian Authority was set up its
role as Prime Minister Robyn pointed out
with great pleasure was to its role
would be to control the Palestinian
population and by force and violence and
terror could be as brutal as it wanted
corrupt as it wanted didn't matter as
long as it kept Palestinians under
control as Rabine put it in this usual
gentle way they would be able to control
the Palestinians without concern for
human rights organizations the Israeli
High Court
mothers and fathers don't like what's
happening what their children are doing
and so on and so forth a standard
colonial procedure is very familiar in
the history of colonialism the imperial
colonies are almost always run by
collaborators not by the imperial
country collaborators run the political
system from security forces one of the
shocking things about these American
occupation of Iraq is that it hasn't
been able to duplicate amazingly what
almost every military occupation does
quite easily surprising anybody that was
the role of the Palestinian Authority so
things continued through the 1990s with
continued steady Israeli US backed
Israeli settlement and development
programs the year 2000 the last Clinton
Barack year actually had the highest
level of settlement since before the
Oslo agreements was continuing steadily
and in fact increasing and that's the
core has been the core of the
territorial problem there are other
problems but the keeping just of the
occupation it's a territorial issue and
that's the core of Camp David in there
was another Camp David meeting in the
summer of 2000 where proposals were made
they were very highly praised in the
United States as extremely magnanimous
and generous and marvelous offer which
the Palestinians turned down because
they want to kill all the Jews or
something like this there's a very easy
way to test that thesis which was
essentially unanimous and us journalism
and commentary the easy way to test the
thesis is to look at a map seems obvious
if it's a magnanimous generous offer
than the math bow to show it well that's
not so easy it turns out because no one
has been able to find a single map in
the entire US media it's not that they
were hard to find
I mean they're available in the standard
scholarly sources which the press and
commentators use when they want to they
were they are in the Israeli press they
were they are in critical literature
came the talks of mine and others we
described the maps so they were there
they just weren't presented the reason
why they weren't presented is that it's
pretty clear when you look at them the
generous offer broke the West Bank into
essentially three separated Canton's and
northern central and southern one
divided from one another by Israeli
settlement and huge infrastructure
properties projects all three of them
pretty much separated home virtually
separated from a small part of Jerusalem
the fourth West Bank Canton that's
traditionally the center of Palestinian
commercial cultural life health services
and so on so for West Bank enclaves
separated from Gaza future which was
unclear so that's what most many
mainstream Israeli commentators rightly
called a kind of a ban to stand
settlement referring to the South
African model which was in fact
conscious model I should say the well
you know magnanimous from some points of
view not from others in wrecking just to
be fair to Clinton and Barack one should
say that it was a considerable
improvement over the existing situation
the existing situation was that the Gaza
was split into three separate regions
three separate Palestinian Canton's and
the West Bank was separated into 227
Canton's little areas some a few square
kilometers basically closed off and this
was going to improve it to four Canton's
and
West Bank and presumably one and Gaza so
it wasn't improvement it's worth
remembering that two hundred and twenty
seven and three because the current
roadmap you know the of the quartet it's
usually called the US roadmap calls for
and out in the distance sometime a
return to the status quo as of 2000 so
therefore it's interesting to remember
what the status quo was in two thousand
two hundred and twenty seven Palestinian
Canton's in the West Bank and three in
Gaza the that obviously wasn't going to
go anywhere
however negotiations did continue after
the Intifada broke out shortly after
negotiations continued in Taba in
Egyptian city in Taba in nineteen and
2001 in January there were informal but
high-level negotiations between
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators and
they reached a tentative agreement which
is available if you're interested in the
Israeli press and the European press I
don't think there's any never seen any
discussion of it in the United States
except again around the periphery
dissident literature there's a detailed
description of it by the European Union
observer which is accurate it was
accepted by both sides published in the
mainstream Israeli press and it's a
clear improvement over the impossible
Geneva Accords there were still points
of disagreement territorial points about
you know Israeli salience breaking up
the West Bank and so on but it was a
step towards a more equitable resolution
of the territorial problem
well that was terminated those
negotiations were terminated by Israeli
prime minister
who Barak right before the Israeli
elections it was thought that that ended
it we've recently learned that the
negotiations continued and they lead up
to the Geneva Court if you take a look
at the Geneva Accords again here you
can't agen aliy find something looking
like a map their considerable
improvement over the Taba proposals
which were themselves a very substantial
improvement over Camp David good look at
the details that's essentially what's on
the table now it could be I think to go
back to where I started the basis for a
serious political settlement that it
would least end the cycle of violence
and maybe lay the basis for something
better in the future
is it just no it's not just for one
reason
Israel incidentally abandons nothing in
the top in the Geneva Accords zero to be
precise it abandons a little strip of
territory along the Gaza Strip which is
not very important and in retirement
takes over a piece of the West Bank but
it abandons nothing in the you know
that's which it's legally entitled at
least the Palestinians do abandon quite
a bit they abandon a stretch of the West
Bank and crucially a large section of
the Palestinians are not represented at
all namely the refugees they're not part
of these negotiations and their rights
are essentially dismissed several
million people the so you know terms of
justice probably make all kind of
criticisms of it I should say many long
old friends of mine and longtime
associates have signed protests against
it which I don't agree with because I
think
you again and I'll stop with this that
of the realistic possibility is
realistic it's about the only one that
has any chance of being implemented in
some other universe one could think of
other things but people who are
suffering and miserable and tortured
can't live with promises of some other
universe now they have to have solutions
in this universe which in my view anyhow
that's where things stand now and how
they got there as I understand it so let
me stop you
Thank You professor Chomsky I would like
now I would like to now present
professor Chomsky with the traditional
jordanian headscarf as a token of our
appreciation recently people have been
associating these head scars with
terrorists and terrorism this is
unfortunate and we would hope to fight
the stereotype and reassociate these
head scarves with their true cultural
significance I would not I would like to
open the floor for questions
you know it's a long story I've written
a lot about it so let me just refer you
to what I've written but then then I'll
just briefly summarized so I've been
writing about it for four years as
internal documents have been coming out
and we get a clearer picture of it
there's a summary in at least the way I
understand it and a book of mine that
just came out a couple of weeks ago
called hegemony or survival one of the
chapters is about this and it reviews
what I think the record shows in brief
it seems to me it's roughly like this in
1948 the Joint Chiefs of Staff the US
military was very impressed with
Israel's military prowess and described
them as Israel as the most powerful
military force in the Middle East
second only to Turkey turkey was really
the base of us power and remains so the
main military force and they mentioned
they said well sooner or later you know
we might want to think about Israel as a
base for us part of the u.s. system of
control what the u.s. is concerned about
in the Middle East is no secret it has
the world's major energy resources
period if it wasn't for that could go
down the tube and when it's the oil is
finished it will go down the tube unless
something is done these are internal
serious internal problems for the Arab
world I should say but as far as the
United States is concerned what's
important is to control the oil the u.s.
at that time in the mid-forties State
Department described the Persian Gulf
Resources is what they called a
stupendous source of strategic power and
one of the greatest material prizes in
world history the most important area in
the world for foreign investment not a
small thing you know kind of important
even more so today and the method of
control of the oil resources was
essentially taken over from the British
British had been the primary imperial
power u.s. was a secondary player up
until the Second World War the British
and secondarily
mostly controlled that region the
British technique was to establish what
they called an Arab facade that meant
weak pliable government which would
control their own populations with and
behind the scenes behind with the
British called various constitutional
fictions like democracy and freedom and
Parliament and so on behind those
constitutional fictions the British
would effectively rule but the Arab
facade would run it again the standard
Imperial pattern the it pretty much what
the US is trying to institute in Iraq
right now it's almost copying the
British model the France was a secondary
power in the region after the Second
World War the u.s. simply kicked France
out on the legalistic grounds in France
was an enemy country because it had been
conquered by the Germans and therefore
its concessions were removed you can do
that if you're powerful so France was
kicked out Britain was slowly reduced to
the level of junior partner and the u.s.
took it over
but essentially with the British
framework Arab facades the United States
however introduced another level of
control what were called peripheral
States not non Arab States which would
be with the Nixon administration later
called local cops on the beat they were
police headquarters would be in
Washington of course and kind of a
branch office in London but the local
cops on the beat would be the military
powers around the Gulf region and one of
them was Turkey that was the main ones
still the main one another was ran after
the succeeded in overthrowing the
parliamentary regime in Iran in 1953 and
reinstituting the dictatorship Iran was
the second major cop on the beat and the
question was
Pakistan played a role and the question
was would Israel be one of them that's
been the issue well in 1958 that it was
a long step towards that that it was a
very long but I won't go into it in
detail but it was a very important year
in the Middle East in effect in the
world 1958 the Iraq broke out of the
anglo-american condominium there was a
military coup in Iraq and it took over
tannoy resources it was deep concern in
London and Washington the British
British military base was Jordan looked
as it was under threat the US sent to
military forces to Lebanon apparently
equipped with nuclear weapons the
concern was that Nasser Nasser of Egypt
it was the nationalist symbol was
influencing independent nationalism in
the region the only country in the
region that offered any support to the
US and Britain at the time was Israel
did all turkey of course but that's
taken for granted Turkey and Iran are
taken for granted but right in the
region Israel did offer some support the
President Eisenhower and the National
Security Council in 1958 internally
concluded that as they put it a logical
corollary of opposition to Arab
nationalism his support for Israel as
the only reliable base internal to the
region
part of the periphery system in 1967
that was just solidified I mean when
Israel conquered essentially destroyed
Nasser who was the main concern of the
US and that was considered a great a
great gift to us power and to the facade
that was a defense of the oil monarchies
against nationalism and from then on
it's just continued Israel has been
regarded as what's called a strategic
asset in the early 70s
US intelligence regarded
director of the region of us power in
the region is based on a local
tripartite alliance between Israel Saudi
Arabia and Iran with turkey right in the
background leading US political figures
who were concerned with the region like
Senator Jackson expressed the same views
in 1959 the Shah was overthrown Iran
went off you know became an enemy and
that just meant the role of Israel was
more important
in fact the Israeli Turkish alliance is
extremely close it was founded in 1958 a
military alliance that faithful a year
and it's now Israel's strongest alliance
after the United States part of the
framework of control by now Israel's
become virtually a US military base it's
it's got the most it's a little country
small country but it has extremely
powerful military forces it has hundreds
of nuclear weapons other weapons of mass
destruction it's according to its own
military sources the its air and armored
forces are larger and technologically
more advanced than any NATO power
outside the US so it's no small thing
it's tightly linked to the United States
in terms of its economy kind of a
high-tech military based economy really
closely interlinked with the u.s. it's
coming to mimic the United States and
other respects it was at one point a
relatively egalitarian more or less
social democratic society Scandinavian
type social democracy that's all
completely gone it's now like the United
States has the highest inequality in the
industrial world after the United States
social systems collapsing like in the
United States and in other respects it's
becoming similar to the boss man called
partner not surprisingly but I think
that's the core of the issue I mean
there are other things you know there
other factors but my view at least
in the core okay so his very reasonable
question is that I said before that I
think the current Geneva Accords as
they're called the ones under discussion
in Geneva are the least bad or they were
the best can the best plan that can be
implemented why did I have the opposite
view about the Oslo agreements Camp
David and Tabitha
that's the question well the reason is
that these are the first agreements the
first proposals that do not institute
effectively bantu stands in the occupied
territories on the Oslo agreements in
1993 essentially offered the
Palestinians nothing and as I mentioned
they didn't mention Palestinian rights
the over the Oslo years if you look at
the success of agreements again I've
written a lot about it others have to
they simply institutionalized Israeli
control over the occupied territories
when I say Israeli I mean US backed
Israeli Israel can't do anything without
us backing the Camp David Accords as I
mentioned I think we're a disaster table
agreements were somewhat better but they
still had those that they never resolved
the issue if you look at the type of
agreements they never resolved the issue
of the Israeli salience the settlements
aliens that effectively broke the West
Bank into three parts
it was left unresolved at the end of the
table agreements these proposals
actually do offer a resolution you can
debate whether you like the resolution
but at least you know it's something
that it would lead to a territorial
division that allows for a degree of
independence subsidiary independence no
doubt all of these proposals establish
what a hoot Barack's chief negotiator
aslam have been on me in israeli
academic described as the goal of the
Oslo Accords and namely a permanent
neo-colonial dependency for the
Palestinians in one form or another they
all have that character that's part of
the injustice but on four you know my
view that's at the moment that's a fact
of life until the United States and
other international forces modify their
position on this I don't think anything
more just can be obtained this is pretty
much in our hands incidentally as I
mentioned the u.s. population just to
give you an indication of US public
opinion which is rarely reported in the
United States because it's too opposed
to US government policy but the US
public is about two-thirds in favor of
what's called the Saudi plan which means
total Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied territories no no this
shenanigans around the border in turn
for peace the by a very substantial
majority also about two to one the
public thinks that the United States
ought to terminate aid to either of the
two parties either Israel or the
Palestinians which is not negotiating in
good faith to achieve a political
settlement and if both parties are
negotiating the u.s. Oh to equalize aid
to them well you know if any of you are
familiar with the actual aid flow I mean
this is a radical revision of US policy
I mean just a total revision of the in
fact US public opinion is so extreme on
this matter that these facts can't even
be reported and they aren't so even
though they come from the major academic
based polling agency in the United
States program on international policy
attitudes University of Maryland very
detailed in-depth studies which are
quoted when they give tolerable results
but not here and in fact that means that
people who have these attitudes probably
think they're isolated you know they
probably think I'm the only person in
the country who believes this because
you don't know that other people do well
all of that is important because it
means there is a basis a popular basis
for developing political pressures that
could lead to a political settlement
could shift us unilateral rejection of
even the Geneva Accords but it has to be
done it's not going to happen by itself
well actually I haven't read the book
and to tell you the honest truth I
haven't read anything of his and since
for the last 30 years ever since he was
publicly exposed very publicly in the
Boston Globe as a liar and a fraud and a
fanatic opponent of civil rights it's
all in print I can give it to if you
like but since then I frankly haven't
bothered the question was have I read
Alan Dershowitz his book and what do I
think about what he said about me all
right that's it's astonishing
you can look at it if you like the book
itself I've seen parts of because people
sent me pieces and it's just I don't
like to give general comments without
details in front of me but if you can
think of anything that ought to be
commented on well actually he's
referring to it's interesting what he
does there at least what was sent to me
I assume what was sent to me by several
people including his associates was
accurate so all the same he quotes
something from a talk that I gave at
Harvard about a year ago he doesn't
quote from the talk which is about a
totally different first of all quoting
from a talk is already childish and
ridiculous
nobody does it especially when a ton of
materials in print but he didn't quote
from the talk he quoted from the Q&A
which is even more ridiculous he quoted
a comment that I made about Benny Morris
in the Q&A which is of course from
memory you know wasn't part of the talk
turns out the quote was almost a
word-for-word paraphrase of what Morris
actually said ok so what he quoted was a
comment of mine in informal Q&A
referring to Benny Morris and in fact
precise almost precise oh you know it's
so close to accurate he could have been
in a scholarly article and no one would
have noticed it it wasn't a quote of
course it was a paraphrase but it
happened to be almost verbatim and
that's what he says he can refute citing
anymore and I'll give you the wording if
you like but that's the way it continues
it's a joke well now the question had to
do with the Russian policy throughout
this whole period and whether than the
you turn in in recent years it has been
though you turn Russian policy
throughout this period was right in the
heart of the international consensus I
mean there's all kind of issues you
could talk about but of the issues that
I've been discussing the diplomacy
Russia was no different from Western
Europe as far as the diplomacy was
concerned they supported the
international consensus since the mid
1970s they continued to support it
Brezhnev put forth his own plan which is
approximately identical and they backed
all the UN resolutions they were right
in the core of the international
consensus and they still are I mean
there is a change in policy but
lots of ways but not on the diplomacy of
the Middle East I mean because there
really hasn't been any change in the
International position you know a slight
modifications but the international
position which has just been an
overwhelming consensus is has been
pretty stable
it's been blocked by the United States
but no one else doesn't exert much
pressure I mean it did support the Arab
state
so as support of the Arab states
militarily it gave some tepid support to
the Palestinians not amounting to much
but you know that's yeah that's part of
the Cold War if the United States
militarily sports one side the Russians
support the other so on but it had
almost nothing to do with the diplomacy
Israeli military power was backed by the
US and Turkey and so on was just
overwhelming as I mentioned by now the
Israel was more powerful than any NATO
power it's not Russia that you know
England France
well I mean that there are unpleasant
things going on in the United States and
internal to Israel but by comparative
standards by world standards the United
States and Israel for Jews is a very
heart both very free societies so we're
not under you know you don't have to be
afraid of the police when you walk
outside yeah sure for marginalized
communities true but that's always been
true in fact it's been much worse in the
past I look it's not good now a lot of
terrible things are happening now so
what's happening say under the Patriot
Act it should not be tolerated in a
democratic society on the other hand we
should also be realistic by comparative
standards either to the rest of the
world or even the recent US history it's
not all it's not out of sight I'm in the
programs of internal repression that ran
through the Kennedy to Nixon
administration's were much more serious
than what's happening now they're also
not purported much because wrong story
but COINTELPRO the counterintelligence
program which was run by the national
political police the FBI from Kennedy
actually started under Eisenhower mainly
Kennedy Johnson and Nixon until it was
finally stuck by the courts was
theoretically at least was far more
severe repression than anything that
exists now I mean it went all the way to
political assassination it was really no
joke and even that didn't begin to
compare with Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare
comparably worse than either of them so
it's there has been us general
improvement I mean Ashcroft with deadly
that was like to drive it back but and
there's plenty of things that should be
should not be tolerated
but the repression is restricted in the
United States to highly vulnerable
people of course that's not a compliment
you know but independent shouldn't be
tolerated but it's realistic and by
comparison with other part
of the world you know it's hardly
repression and for Jews in Israel it's
the same for Palestinians of course it's
vicious and harsh military occupation as
it's been for 35 years I mean it's
different than it was in earlier years
you know so gonna be more black faces
and Harvard and mighty than there were
30 years ago on the other hand if you
take a look at the prison population I
mean it's just outrageous a huge part of
the black and Latino population are
simply thrown into jail that's mainly
what the drug wars are about it's a
device for getting rid of superfluous
people by tossing him in jail and that
certainly should not be tolerated but
again you know go back say - 30 years 35
years COINTELPRO reached the point of
literally assassinating black organizers
assassinating him no Fred Hampton was
murdered in his bed in a Chicago police
raid set up by the FBI probably drugged
murdered another guy - and nobody cared
no fact I went to his funeral in Chicago
I think it was one of about ten white
faces and a huge black audience and
nobody cared in fact probably very few
of even know about it because that was
just what you do to people you know the
yeah and that's not the only case
happens to be the worst case but that's
not happening now
bad things are but not that this had to
do with the assassination and you know
the use of force and by US forces in
Iraq and borrowings from Israel that's
been reported in the press in the last
couple of days the u.s. press and the
British press that there I'm in US
government denies it but reports are
that they're getting Israeli
intelligence to help them out with
control of the population frankly I tend
to
think that the US government denials are
probably accurate the reason is that
these kinds of vicious tactics are just
second nature to military forces anyway
they don't have to get advice from
anyone but and they're it's not that
there are some you know sophisticated
techniques that we couldn't think of in
ten minutes there was a limited number
of ways of controlling people by
violence
so maybe the denials are accurate but
it's probable that they're interacting
the and if you want to know what it is I
mean there's they're telling you
straight out so there's nothing for me
to say there was a front-page story the
lead story in the New York Times
three or four days ago couple of days
ago was by Dexter Filkins and well you
read it yourself but to me it came
straight out it seemed canvas coming
straight out of the Nazi archives I mean
it quoted
US military officers as saying the Arab
mind understands only a force and you
know honor or something and went on to
say the way you have to control these
people is by users showing them that you
can use force and crush them and then
they'll respect you that's very familiar
I'm in year old Harvard students you've
read history you know exactly what page
of history it comes from putting aside
the Nazi archives it comes straight out
of the British Empire take a look at the
Encyclopedia Britannica I've got the
Edition that was given to me on my bar
mitzvah so it's an old edition that's
1939 but but if you look in the 1939
edition of the encyclopaedia Britannica
and you look at the section on India
it's written by some British military
officer who describes how the Punjabi is
the military you know caste and India
enjoyed being beaten up and when the
British beat the out of them they
really respected the British
for that and after that they kind of you
know followed with the British wanna you
think I'm exaggerating you know look at
it doesn't say beat the out of
approximately says that and that's the
standard view about the natives what you
have to do is smash them in the face
they don't understand anything they're
barbarians they look for it
they love force and they respect for us
and when you do that you gotta control
that's the air of mine you know I mean
if something like that were said about
the Jewish mind on the front page of the
New York Times you know the country
would explode but when you say it about
the Arab mind it's okay in fact you can
find distinguished Harvard professors
who write things not very different from
that and nobody cares but so yes the
tactics are familiar if they're getting
them from Israel I don't know maybe they
are but it's mostly second nature to
conquerors so suppose the United see if
I understood if the United States
secured its own resources what would its
strategy be in the region exactly the
same as it is now because it has nothing
to do with us access to those resources
and if you think about the history
you'll see that I started from 1945 when
the u.s. took over the region because it
was stupendous source of strategic power
and the greatest interior one of the
greatest material prizes in world
history
well that would remain true at that time
the United States was the major or the
North America was the major oil producer
in the world the US wasn't using those
resources in fact the u.s. remained the
North America that includes the Gulf and
so on was the major oil producer until I
think around 1970 but it still had to
maintain control of those resources this
is control not access if you look at us
produce intelligence projections
contemporary US intelligence projections
for the next 15 years or so they're
public and worth looking at they predict
that the Persian Gulf will be even more
important in the future in fact
that'll provide about two-thirds of
world energy resources in the next
roughly 15 years but the u.s. won't rely
on they say the u.s. itself will rely on
more stable West Atlantic Basin
resources like West Africa it's one of
the reasons for the concern and
intervention in West Africa West Africa
and the Western Hemisphere again that's
one of the reasons for the concern about
the turmoil in the Andes which are sort
of getting out of control in a very
likely target of US military
intervention because that's regarded as
one of the potential major energy
resources but even if the US so they
themselves are expecting to rely on
resources that are less hazardous you
know more stable but I still want to
control the most you know stupendous
source of strategic power and one of the
greatest material prizes in world
history in fact if the u.s. went to
renewable energy tomorrow
I don't think policy would change this
is a lever of world control it you
control the Gulf energy resources you
pretty much control the world and and
the material prize means huge profits I
mean again this morning's I think front
page of the New York Times yeah front
page that's a story on how Halliburton
is gouging you and your parents by
charging ludicrous prices to import
quaity oil into Iraq about twice as much
as Iraq and Kuwait pay yeah that's a
great material prize it yields one major
historian of the oil industry called
profits beyond the dream of avarice and
it still does for the future that's even
if we use renewable energy and the
stupendous source of strategic power
remains controlling the world is not an
easy business you know it's a tough job
for those guys in Washington the
International Society is not dominated
by the
it states from an economic point of view
the United States it's just one of a
number of equals Europe's approximately
like the United States Northeast Asia is
written is has a greater gross domestic
product and the u.s. does considerably
greater about 50% greater and holds
about half of us of global foreign
exchange and is the most dynamic region
in the world also has resources I say
yeah Laura Tyson who was chair of the
Council of Economic Advisers under
Clinton just described couple days ago
described the world economy briefly very
succinctly in four words said the world
economy is based on the principle that
America spends Asia lends that's more or
less accurate and that's a very fragile
situation the there's only one dimension
in which the u.s. is overwhelmingly
dominant namely violence that's why the
Bush administration which has a rather
extreme but it's not pretty narrow
spectrum it does want the world to be
organized on the basis of force it makes
very good sense you know you play your
strong card and the strong card for the
United States is force not economy not
culture not other things it's force the
u.s. spends roughly about as much as the
rest of the world combined and military
force and it's technologically far more
advanced right now at the United Nations
if we had something like a free press in
the country what you'd be reading on the
front page is what's going on at the
General Assembly right now right now
every day there's debates on the
disarmament commitment the you you end
disarmament Committee on disarmament and
international security or some such name
is having its meetings right now and as
usual you know your if the year this
goes on underreported the world is
trying to block the military
station of space and the increase of
nuclear weapons and the US is preventing
it that went on there Clinton's going on
now the u.s. is moving on to
militarization of space that which is
extremely hazardous made destroy all of
us that's no joke
right after the u.s. announced the
national security strategy in September
2002 and the invasion of Iraq same time
two months later the Space Command
publicly announced its plans for the
next forget 10 or 15 years and which it
said that the US will move from control
of space to ownership of space well
those of you who've read the national
security strategy know what that means
we don't just control the world we own
it and space we're gonna own which means
no potential know what nobody else gets
near it it's going to be used for
platforms for offensive weapons highly
destructive weapons nuclear non-nuclear
they've adopted a first-strike doctrine
the world is under complete surveillance
you know hypersonic drones tell you if
somebody's crossing the street and you
know Delhi or something like that
in theory what's being worked on our
systems which would enable a command
post in the Colorado mountains to
instantaneously attack and destroy any
target in the world without warning and
they hope with impunity reduces the need
for forward military bases which cause
various problems people don't like them
that's you know sitting right there so
yes
the dimension of force is is the
dominant dimension and the control over
energy resources is a crucial part of
this 50 years ago George Kennan one of
the top planners then pointed out that
control over Middle East oil gives the
United States what he called veto power
over he was thinking of Japan at the
time but in fact everyone a lot of the
maneuvering in the Middle East and
Central Asia if you really look at it
close
is about you know the direction in which
the pipelines will go and who's going to
control production and transit routes
and that has to do with controlling
Europe and Asia Northeast Asia
particularly they who understand it
perfectly well so they've been looking
for their own independent access to
energy resources all along a lot of the
maneuvering is about that again in this
morning's New York Times you can read
Paul Wolfowitz as memo saying that
Germany and France will not be permitted
to take part in the what's called the
reconstruction of Iraq well partly
that's just a reflection of the
unbelievably passionate hatred of
democracy by Wolfowitz and the Bush
administration and others like them I'm
they're furious at France and Germany
because France and Germany the
government's took the same position as
the overwhelming majority of the
population so therefore they have to be
punished the good guys like Italy in
Spain the government overruled an even
larger majority of the population so
they've got to be rewarded it's kind of
intriguing about the US intellectual
community that this can go on alongside
of you know owes to the love of
democracy of Paul Wolfowitz and so on so
part of it is just the normal hatred of
democracy but it's more than that France
and Germany are they heartland of Europe
you know that's the industrial
commercial financial heart of Europe and
if they get access to the Middle East
that's no good because then they won't
be under the thumb of the United States
we need that too the veto power so go
back to your question shift the
renewable energy I don't think anything
would change who would the Palestinian
leaders be with the greatest chance of
negotiation success well maybe that's up
to the Palestinians to decide right the
and the Palestinians have decided I mean
when Bush made his speech about
democracy that we were all supposed to
worship a couple of weeks ago
it was mostly ridiculed in the Middle
East and in fact most of the world
outside of England
for very simple reasons if you look at
what he says just you know he praised
various democracy you know these
countries are advancing toward democracy
these are not so good and so on had
absolutely nothing to do with democracy
anybody knows about the countries knows
no correlation but it had a very good
correlation to willingness to accept US
orders so if you were following us
orders you were progressing toward
democracy just kind of like Italy in
Spain and France in Germany but what's
striking about the Middle East is that
there is one elected leader there's one
genuinely elected leader in the region
the region one I elected by supervised
elections you know probably not perfect
but I thought that they were worse than
the 2000 elections they who did they
elect well Yassir Arafat is the one
elected leader in the region so what is
the Bush administration have to say
about him out you know that's because of
our love of democracy and our grand
vision about democracy I mean I don't
like him personally I wouldn't have
voted for him but it's not up to me you
know that he was elected by the
Palestinians if you want to know which
leaders should negotiate well you know
let the Palestinians pick a leadership
they've already done it don't pick
another one
see if but let them do it not in
Washington not Paul Wolfowitz or other
people whose contempt for democracy is
goes beyond discussion I let them do it
themselves I I think there are better
choices but Who am I to say is there for
them to say and in fact as far as our
effort is concerned whatever you think
about him he has biked by comparison on
these issues by comparison with American
or Israeli leaders he's been you know
far more willing to accept a diplomatic
settlement in fact that's been
considered the problem ever since the
mid 70s he's been pressing for a
political settlement
when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 with
us backing again otherwise they couldn't
have done it and killed about 20,000
people and destroyed most of the South
it had nothing to do with self-defense
they didn't pretended it did it had to
do with getting rid of the PLO which was
becoming Arafat as one of the Israel's
leading scholar on the Palestinians
could it very conservative guy
Yehoshua Arad he said that the Arafat's
insistence on diplomacy and negotiations
are what he called a veritable
catastrophe for Israel so we got to put
an end to it and return them to terror
which we like but not negotiations which
we don't want it was a war for the West
Bank it was called by the highest
political and military echelon
yeah because they were pressing for a
political settlement US and Israel
didn't want so as if you want somebody
to negotiate for a diplomatic settlement
well there's a choice I mean the people
who the Palestinians elected who happens
have been trying to do it for the West
since the mid seventies my choice no but
it's not up to me to decide so they the
comment is that since 9/11
Israel has framed its actions in the
context of the war on terror so anything
it does is part of the u.s. war against
terror right and the question is how
would that framing of the issues you
know how would it affect US government
policy
well actually US government policy is so
like every state is so completely
hypocritical that didn't make any
different but the and the u.s. is not
alone in this respect but the the
framing you're correct about the framing
but remember it's not Israel it's just
about every country in the world
so Russia for example
it was carrying out vicious atrocities
in Chechnya immediately reconstructed
what it was doing as part of the war on
terror figuring they'd get a patent
ahead from Washington which they did so
the u.s. now supports the openly the
Russian monstrous atrocities in Chechnya
and every other government in the world
approximately the same thing
I mean Israel in the West Bank Indonesia
not J you know everywhere other
governments like the United States or
England and in fact most instituted some
kind of repressive legislation to
control their own populations usually
called protection against terrorism acts
or you know Patriot Act there's nothing
like that had almost nothing to do with
terrorism had a lot to do with
population control so yes the natural
response of any power system any state
to September 11th was to increase its
power and repression under the pretext
of defense against terror and is really
the same thing but it's trust the board
you have to look hard to find an
exception is Israel defending itself
against terror well you know take a look
every day there's an article about the
separation wall right this wall that's
snaking through the West Bank the
general Security Council and the General
Assembly have tried to block it US stops
it vetoes up as usual and the
justification I mean it's leaving a
couple hundred thousand Palestinians
essentially in limbo
no they're deprived of the lands don't
have to get it but sooner or later
they'll get out one of the leading
Israeli commentators Amira Hass
describes it as a step towards expulsion
probably is it's described as needed for
protection of Israel for security isn't
I mean think about it for a second think
about for one second
suppose you wanted to build a wall to
protect Israel where would you put it
well you'd put it a couple of miles
inside is
if you put the wool a couple of miles
inside the Greenline you could build it
a hundred feet high if you want you
could have the Israeli army patrolling
on both sides you could mine it with
nuclear weapons you do anything you want
and you wouldn't get one word of
international protest and nobody could
pass it it would be an impenetrable wall
so if security is the issue that's what
you do I mean you don't increase
security by putting a couple hundred
thousand Palestinians inside you know
the wall well you know that is so
obvious that it really takes genius not
to see it now ask yourself if there is a
single comment anywhere pointing out
that this thing can't possibly be for
protection of Israelis it's impossible
that's not where you'd put it so why not
do it that way what does if you do it
that way you don't steal Palestinian
land you inconvenience Israelis who
would have to go through gates instead
of Palestinians who have to go through
gates that are never open and so
therefore it's no good well that tells
you what the wall is about okay
it's nothing to do with security except
for security for the Israeli settlements
which are illegal anyway but so it's
just a way of taking over of advancing
the us-israeli program of gradually
integrating the valuable parts of the
territories inside Israel now under the
pretext of security but the pretext is
so ludicrous in this case you really
have to admire the commentators who
can't see it and as far as I'm aware
that's a hundred percent I've never seen
a word pointing out the obvious which is
obvious on a moment's reflection that if
you want a wall that's going to secure
Israelis from West Bank infiltration you
put it two miles inside Israel pretty
obvious isn't can you think of a fallacy
thank you very much a lot of us sources
which you quoted from recent news
stories are on that website so it's a
good resource this morning it's a very
big deal I mean if you look at the
international financial you know
discussions the euro is sort of creeping
up on the dollar in terms of value I
mean by now it's overvalued but I mean
as a currency that people are willing to
rely on it's creeping up on the dollar
if you look at bonds that are issued it
used to be overwhelmingly dollar now
it's close to 50 $50 Europe and in many
respects the Euro as a more stable
currency safer currency so Europe for
example doesn't have the you huge US
trade deficit it's not the case that
Asia lens and Europe spends to quote
Laura Tyson and that people understand
that sooner or later Asia OPEC and
others are going to start probably using
a basket of currencies not just the
dollar but a mixture and they might
shift over to Europe the effect of that
on the US economy I mean nobody can
really predict but it could be extremely
serious the US economy is a very fragile
system you know it's a it's a very rich
country and enormous advantages but the
way it's being handled economically is
just a disaster you know the and and the
world knows that they're willing to
support it for some time but when that
all break down though what he knows and
the potential that OPEC might switch to
even in part to the Euro as it might do
is serious in fact that's one of the
reasons I think where the US wants to
ensure
Oh Terry control over the region so that
the facade doesn't get any funny ideas
