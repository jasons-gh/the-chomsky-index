people say i love you know american just
have a policy I hate the policy if it's
we're responsible for the policy it's a
free country we can't say you know I
don't have any responsibility for the
policy because we do we may not know
about it but then we should find out
about it and if we decide we don't like
it we should change it in fact take a
look at the question we've just been
discussing to state settlement about
two-thirds of the American population
supports the international consensus on
this and long which is they ought to be
a two-state solution not roughly the 67
borders and it's financially look the
polls I mean polls will you find roughly
two-thirds of the population saying yes
I support that and roughly the same
proportion says the US ought to become
more involved in the diplomacy people
don't know that that's contradiction the
reason that that policy has that program
has not been achieved is because of
consistent US intervention to prevent it
from being achieved and that continues
at this very moment in fact okay it is a
free country we've got a lot of freedom
that means we had people have the
opportunity to discover its work it's
not going to come easily that's where
the internet is helpful to have the
opportunity to discover the relevant
facts and background which should show
them that their position is
contradictory they must come to
understand what the US government role
has been over the years and preventing
the outcome that they want do you
believe do you in the end then if in
fact accept the premise that people get
for the most part in a democracy people
get the government they deserve no no
you don't know you don't and you because
you're all well let me finish because
you believe the political process is
corrupt and it's not it suits what look
see what everybody says look to me I
know that saying if you guys not it's
not that simple right I mean it it's not
there's robbery and stealing of
elections there is a distribution of
power internal to the country enormous
disparity of economic and other power
and that influences everything that
happens in dramatic ways so many issues
simply don't come up intellectual two
halves have more power than they have
nots in their overwhelming you're able
to exercise
you really look closely elections they
restrict themselves to issues on which
the population they eliminate issues
where the mass of the population opposes
a lead opinion systematically and the
population is aware sit again I'm sorry
well let's take a concrete yes okay year
2000 election saying among the issues
that were highest in concern to the
general population are things that
roughly relate to the so-called trade
agreements so deficits overseas
investment that transfer of jobs you
know lots of topics like that did the
right at that time there was a plan for
a an international hemispheric
conference at Quebec hemispheric summit
three months later which was intended to
extend the NAFTA type agreement to the
whole hemisphere now that's it these are
issues of an enormous concerned right
did it come up in the election no and as
a reason why it didn't come up in the
election and it's consistent on those
issues the public tends to oppose
policies on which there is an elite
consensus and therefore it doesn't come
up in elections well that's rather
excited I mean let me just make sure I'm
saying how do you stand yourself on the
map to agreement I agree with the
general population i think ii with your
hobbies news view is critical critical
every cause because it's the wrong
agreement if you go back to nineteen
ninety ten years ago and the NAFTA
agreement was coming along there were
serious critical analyses of it which
were in favor of a North American Free
Trade Agreement but not this one the
analyses came from the labor movement
they came from Congress's Research
Bureau the office of Technology
Assessment pretty much the same analyses
said yeah a North agreement a North
American economic Rin be a good idea but
this one is designed and as effectively
an investor rights agreement it
privileges rights of investors
and lenders and it marginalizes the
rights of people and what are you've
already done there were you worried
about the laws of jobs and those kinds
of issues that became a political
football on unions essentially were
opposed to us that's the story but it's
not true not in other words you're
saying that then they they misled us
when they made that argument know that
Union did not make they never made an
argument that we were opposed because
they obviously mentioned that but the
labor movement had an official position
it was produced by the labor Advisory
Council along detailed analysis and it
was a very sensible position it was
never given it never entered the media
discussion it was never given any
publicity the labor market the labor
movement was accused of crude
nationalism this that the other thing
that was not their position their actual
position never made it to the public
agenda and and the same is true of
Congress's own research bureau which had
a rather similar analysis yes in favor
of NAFTA style agreement but not that
one it's kind of interesting that a few
days ago the Carnegie Endowment released
an analysis of NAFTA say a fairly
critical analysis it was reported in the
press making some proposals to how it
should have been done and those
proposals though they didn't say so
happen to be very similar to those that
were proposed by the labor movement and
Congress has researched we were ten
years ago but didn't enter the political
discussion was not mentioned in the
media for example well this is only one
example of which there are numerous ones
anyway see if I saying that what you
argue is that people are not getting the
information they need to make wise
choices they aren't you nor in fact are
they given the choice they aren't given
the choice it's also a 20-mile run over
the two parties now made in an election
know that they have but the two parties
represent essentially the same
concentration of interests of economic
power the United States is essentially a
one-party state it's has two factions of
the business party in fact one of the
leading one of the leading clerk science
analyses of the nature of the u.s. party
system by a fine political sciences the
University of Massachusetts Tom Ferguson
is what he calls the investment theory
of politics investors get together to
invest the control you let me ask you
this let's take two or three countries
where you and I know okay we have two
parties in the United Kingdom right the
toy part in the Labour Party is would
you say the same thing about them to
essentially it depends when today like
today today it's today it's close to in
fray of their France you have you have a
socialist party and a you know the
chirag Aulus party essentially the same
I mean didn't know not up there not a
whole lot of differences there may 3500
regular super well we can explain in
Spain we have socialist party you know
well I'd see I would suggest we take it
any different in any of those countries
in terms of how much difference is there
are because let me rest our hands up
there let me make this re with you and
just get the essentially in most
countries the battle in politics is for
the center is it not in most places now
that doesn't mean that that's simply not
true and there are countries that have a
much more lively Democratic culture so
let's take a country that has a really
lively democratic culture much more than
we do like Brazil okay Brazil is a rich
potentially rich important country in
Brazil something just happened recently
which should humiliate us think it's a
real lesson in democracy in Brazil
popular movements Matt large-scale
popular movements which has been
developing over 20 years reach the scale
where they were able to elect a populist
president over the opposition of
highly-concentrated capital and media
concentration we can't even dream of
that well that's a functioning
democratic culture let me let me stop
you for a second we just get a couple
questions in number one he asked that
question recently of garry Wills was
here you know why haven't we seen in the
United States more success by a powerful
coalition essentially coming from the
left but but not necessarily defined by
what the conception traditional
Commission was amytal EFT of Labor and
re
we have like in white crimson what was
it the last time number of times we saw
it with certain sixties that's where the
Great Society programs come from we
thought in the 30s that's where the nur
deal comes from and in fact this is a
battle that goes back to the origins of
American history you know the original
constitutional framework the wave matic
author the Great Society programs was
Lyndon Johnson that's right and he
reached the programs are not initiated
by leaders that's a serious
misunderstanding those programs were
initiated primarily about people who
actually many of them who'd served with
FDR see that's a serious
misinterpretation I believe of the way
the political system works leaders may
sign their names and they make push
programs but they do it because a
popular constituency is compelling them
to do it that's the way changes take
place I mean if there's a large-scale
popular movement and their pressure
there will be somebody will say I'm your
leader but you know since you've made
the present in this the programs that
came out of the so-called Great Society
were the result of popular ferment and
activism and changes that were taking
place significant changes that were
taking place in the 1960s which very
much democratize the society and it led
to these programs since then there's
been an enormous counter-attack from
business sectors trying to beat it back
and that's the course of history you
know that it's the same at the civil
rights movement of the same with the
liberal but let me make this point
balance gets a lot of other things and I
want to say that we were 42 minutes in
we're doing an hour with you and I want
to invite you back because inevitably
people are going to say to me you know
you could have gone for two or three
hours in minimal in or they will say you
interrupt you too much or they say a lot
of other things and I do want to hear
from you and I you know many people many
people so Lyndon Johnson you know as a
man who had was to beholden to economic
interest in terms of how cheap his own
wealth and in terms of a whole range of
things whether it was brown root in
Texas or whether his relationship with a
whole lot of institution but you were
saying that he responded the way he did
to Great Society programs having to do
with with medical care having to do with
having to a whole range of issues in
responded and civil rights pressure
because the public pressure was the same
was true of Jonathan I'm willing to
argue with you that Lyndon Johnson
responded in part because that was where
his heart was and his sense of legatee
in terms of wooded enclosed him and and
secondly he'd some of the things that
John Kennedy responded to he saw his
opportunity in history in a sense to
show that he could get these things
enacted because that was his principal
skill so we're not disagreeing writings
that different topics well you're the
topic that you're talking about its
individual personalities so the
individual personality Lyndon Johnson
what was going on in his mind the topic
that I'm talking about is how popular
movements develop create their own
programs press for them finally often
get somebody to initiate them those are
different question and I mean I mean
just any agree with you actually i mean
i look with great interest in what's
happening in Brazil and I know it's
happened here that's that's why why do
we have freedom of speech my freedom of
speech is not in the Constitution it's
not in the Bill of Rights in fact up
until the 19th it's not up until the
1960s in fact the legal battles about
freedom of speech are mostly in the 20th
century and there was no real legal
protection for substantial freedom of
speech actually until the 60s in the
1960s the Supreme Court finally first in
the course the civil rights movement
then later in the decade finally
realized a level of legal protection of
freedom of speech that to my knowledge
doesn't exist in any other country and
if a large part of it grew out of the
activism so just to understand you
because I want to go to some things that
are often attached to you and bring
great controversy to you other than
freedom of speech what else do you think
it is is part of what America you know
represents yeah represent is well yes is
it about American like what a lot of
things I like that are a great about
American life for one thing we have
compared to those societies there's very
little in the way of a kind of a caste
system so people have interacted
independently of social position is
there an autocracy there is in
certainly in terms of policy formation
that's overwhelming but we're talking in
terms of personal interaction are you
does it matter whether your this is your
what you'll do or that's what you do
well these interactions among people
informal interactions are in my view
much healthier in the United States than
other societies that I know now those
are important facts about a culture hi
freedom of speech is not just a matter
of law it's a matter of being
internalized you know realizing
understanding that's my right now I'm
going to defend it that's important and
the same is true of other rights
actually the United States has become a
much more civilized society since the
1960s just in our recent lifetime cause
do you think because of popular activism
let's take women's rights was that an
issue 40 years ago no environmental
issues did they exist 40 years ago no
let's take something like opposition to
aggression and violence but that
attitudes and that have changed
enormously I mean when John F Kennedy
attacked south vietnam as he did in 1962
direct attack he movies assassination of
jim oh well now when the US except said
they're supportive i mean so little
there was so little opposition to this
that no one even knows what happened but
if you look back at the record the
historical and documentary record it's
not controversial in 1962 kennedy sent
the US air force to start bombing South
Vietnam they did it in South Vietnamese
planes with Vietnamese markings but it
was US pilots and us equipment thin
cover he authorized the use of napalm he
started the crop destruction programs to
keep food from the indigenous rebels
women he started driving away but I got
look this is a war was there any purpose
no ok now that's changed but let me also
maybe somebody wasn't significant look I
can tell you because I was directly
involved well you've got you to know you
because of your position do you don't
get four people in a room to talk about
I you even argue about it was but this
is important about the country it was
four or five years before a significant
popular movement developed opposing an
aggressive war against another country
let's fast forward to today right in
this year there were huge popular
protests before the war was officially
launched that's a tremendous change in
consciousness and why do you think I
changed applies because of the six is
because of unit 13 because as it
breathes it gets wider and stronger and
the change took place because a lot of
people work very hard to make it change
place the same is true of civil rights
of women's rights of environmental
issues and so on well that's the way
change has happened and what it says one
thing happened in Brazil the popular
movements developed that way not by some
leader saying I agree I do agree with
you on that i'm not arguing that but the
interesting thing about brazil now you
know which is a worthy of a program here
and he is somebody that I'd like to I've
heard him speaking with lightness see
him at the table is is he's running he
is disappointing some of his followers
there because of some positions he's
taking having to do with the rainforest
and other issues you know why why
because there are you know so much about
everything check it see this right now
I'm not trying to persuade you know like
no here's what I think and I think if
you investigate this way you'll find all
right over the last 20 or 30 years in
part as a reaction to the Democrat
democratizing tendencies of the 60s
which were worldwide right they were
dramatic here but also elsewhere there's
been a backlash part of the back let's
taken many forms one of the forms it's
taken is international economic
arrangements which are virtually
designed to undermine democracy well
these what's called in the rest of the
world neoliberal arrangements here it's
called free trade but it's not free
trade the array of international
arrangements that's sort of formalized
in the World Trade Organization those
measures if you look at them or it is
well understood that they undermine
democracy one of the first measures that
was taken in the early 70s initially
here but then every where was the free
up flow of financial capital I got you I
need to move on
that's my point i just once i won't try
to explain anything but let me just say
that if you look at these arrangements
you'll find that they undermine
democracy and they place countries in a
stranglehold in which they cannot follow
the policies of the overwhelming
majority and that's what's happening in
Brazil and that's why those disciplines
okay fine I'll move on I talked to
someone else knowing that you were
coming and they said you know I was in
each I was in a rock recently recently
and I meant no araki who said the war
was a mistake lots of them in the idea
of overthrowing Saddam even now and and
many of them wish the United States
would lead many of them have a terribly
disappointed upset opposed to the way
things are going but this person didn't
meet anyone he tell me how you feel
about the use of American power in
overthrowing Saddam was it because it
violated your own sense of international
law was it because that we didn't have
it wasn't a um an acceptable answer the
question because the assumptions are
wrong okay great the United States was
not in favor of overthrowing Saddam
Hussein in fact George Bush made that
explicit said he sorry no you're right a
third summit a couple of days before the
invasion started bush and Blair were
there and they issued a declaration in
which Bush said even if Saddam Hussein
and his family leave the country we're
going to evade anyway and in fact that's
consistent with a long-standing US
policy you're right that every I'm sure
every sane person in Iraq one of your
rid of Saddam Hussein is like I have for
20 years just like we all have a
murderous tyrant why is he there I why
wasn't he overthrown or to ask another
question why do the majority of Iraqis
the Lord when Iraqis are at with the
published polls Iraqis are asked who's
your favorite foreign leader the
favorite foreign leader of Iraqis corded
the us-run poles is President Chirac of
France
who was the symbol of opposition to the
invasion George Bush is far below Blair
even less below nevertheless the same
polls show say yeah we're glad to get
rid of Saddam Hussein well if we want to
think about this we'll be able to figure
out what's happening sure they would
like to get rid of Saddam Hussein they
would have liked that gotten rid of him
years ago I'm in 1991 they almost did
you rid of him but the us-supported
Saddam so that he could crush the
rebellion which probably would have ever
thrown him and we know why I'm not sure
they support him so that he could they
authorized him they effectively
authorized him to crush the rebellion
sure that their many books what but you
got let's look at least let me to make
one point is that I mean it clearly was
a mistake in 1991 who was it a Missouri
it sure it was it allow him to allow him
to our a rebellious day as I do too did
George Bush Nichols mistake no did
Thomas Friedman of the New York Times
think was mistaken i can't speak for
George digin Thomas pretty well did the
New York the Press think it was a
mistake let's take a look back and look
at the allow him to go to helicopters
and be able to crush take a look at the
analyses the analogies and executive
asked to who had ads to rise up let's
take as much as the analyses at the time
that's what we should be looking at the
you know you can read it in say the New
York Times most important newspaper in
the world their analysis was Alan Cowell
their Middle East correspondent that
much as we dislike the atrocities
there's an overwhelming consensus that
Saddam Hussein offers more hope for the
stability of the country's stability the
kind of technical word stability the
country then the people are trying to
overthrow in other words we'd rather
have him than the people are trying to
overthrow him Thomas Friedman maybe they
were Thomas Friedman who was a
diplomatic cars chief diplomatic
correspondent wrote the best possible
solution for the United the best
possible world for the United States
would be an iron-fisted military junta
ruling Iraq the same way Saddam Hussein
did much to the censure of this electron
I'm sure he didn't mean using the
torture
using the technique yes then why did he
say it well but he may very well have
believed that was they may vary way he
must he may very well first of all I'm
leery of speaking for anyone like this
right george bush or tom friedman but he
may very well have meant that that iraq
because of whatever fears he had they
would break up the balkanization of a
robber and therefore he needed it quito
la array of men let's say up and then
see that means that from the point of
view of us policymakers and us
commentators it wasn't a mistake I think
it was a mistake you think mistake but
they didn't write the the analysts and
the policymakers thought it was right
well I preferred and then let's look
like that you the neo-cons who you final
so much fall in there did not think it
was a mistake we don't know they were
they willful wits of the world probably
don't know like it was let's take a look
at the not to overthrown suppose I mean
they've been driven by overthrowing
Saddam since 1991 you'll agree with that
won't you no I don't they hadn't been
driven by the notion it's just too
narrow question let's take a look at the
Wolfowitz 'as of the world okay he has a
record right right his record is for
example strong support of general
suharto who is exactly thirty serbian
indonesia and afterwards up until
nineteen ninety-seven a couple of months
before so heart that was overthrown he
was still praising him so hard there was
a mass murderer probably worse since i
was saying he came into power killing
couple hundred thousand people he ran a
regime of vicious torture and oppression
he invaded east timor practically
destroyed it his torture and massacres
were going on right to the end of his
rule Wolfowitz was praising him because
of his contributions to the growth and
development of Indonesia actually what
served as ambassador to Indonesia this
started when he was in the State
Department with responsibility for Asia
Southeast Asia in particular went on was
in he was in sm bastard Indonesia and it
continued through his post government
service and he was it will give away
that doesn't one example as under his
watch as State Department
high official in the state department
with responsibility for Asia the Reagan
administration under his watch supported
a whole range of murderous dictators
like Chun of South Korea let's put him
up my own but that began I'm not sure
I'm done and I'm not sure when he came
in what he didn't have run out of
American administration which is your
appoint exactly whole series of Merrick
administration's supported a whole
series of leaders in South Korea
absolutely and Wolfowitz was responsible
is in charge almost in charge in a
second in command State Department right
up to the end Marcos and the Philippines
another let me know they're all kind of
fake stories being concocted about this
now but I would urge people to go back
to the original record and see what
happened all right this book noam
chomsky hedge Moneo survival America's
quest for global dominance we'll talk
more about all these issues with him and
