it's it should be understood to be a
real war and it's not a new war it's an
old war furthermore it's a perfectly
conscious war everywhere but
specifically in the United States where
there happens to this very free country
but it happens to have a highly class
conscious business class and always has
and it's very free and open so you have
a lot of information about it they talk
you have their records and they have
long seen themselves as fighting a
bitter class Wars if they don't want
anybody else to know about it
occasionally someone else gets the news
rather famous case which I'm sure you
know was Doug Fraser about 20 years ago
1978 I think when he pulled out of the
labor-management council and condemned
business leaders for words were roughly
like this for having decided to fight a
one-sided class war against working
people the poor the unemployed
minorities even members of the middle
class and for having torn up the fragile
social compact that had been achieved
during periods of growth and prosperity
in fact had been achieved primarily we
didn't say this primarily through rather
militant struggle very militant struggle
under harsh conditions back in the 1930s
but not the only thing wrong with his
statement is that it was way too late in
fact that war that he's talking about
was initiated as soon as the fragile
social compact was established back in
the 1930s and very openly there's no if
you that's you don't have to go to
secret records to find out about it nor
do you have to have been at the wrong
end of the
clubs when the strikes were broken up in
the late 30s to know about it it was
completely public the reason that's not
well-known is because neither the
educational system nor scholarship like
Harvard and so on pay any attention to
it it's not a topic that study so
there's no doubt that one of the major
issues of 20th century history surely in
the United States is corporate
propaganda that's a huge industry in
fact it it extends over the obviously
the commercial media but the the whole
range of systems that reach the public
the entertainment industry television a
good bit of what peers in the schools a
lot of what appears straight out in the
newspapers and so on huge amount of that
comes straight out of the public
relations industry which was established
in this country early in the century and
sort of developed mainly in the 20s and
on and has become an enormous industry
it's now spreading over the rest of the
world but it's primarily here and its
goal from the beginning perfectly openly
and consciously was to control the
public mind as they put it and the
reason was that the public mind was seen
as the greatest threat to corporations
that's from early in the century
business power was strong but it's a
very free country by comparative
standards and it's hard to call on state
violence not impossible but hard to call
upon state violence to crush people's
efforts to achieve freedom and rights
and justice so therefore it was
recognized early on that it's going to
be necessary to control people's minds I
should say that's not a new insight
either you know you can read it in David
Hume and the Enlightenment where it was
already recognized and thank you back
the earliest stirrings of democratic
revolutions in England in the 17th
century and there already was concerned
that we're not going to be able to
control people by force and we therefore
have to control them by the means
controlling what they think what they
feel their attitudes their
attitudes toward one another I mean all
sorts of mechanisms of control are going
to have to be devised which will replace
the efficient use of force and violence
that was available to a much greater
extent earlier on and as has been
fortunately declining you know not
uniformly but often declining through
the years particularly here leading to
the need for other methods of control
you don't have to move very far from the
Cambridge a leak to learn about it the
major the leading figure of the public
relations industry is a highly regarded
Cambridge liberal roosevelt kennedy
liberal died recently Edward Bernays who
wrote the standard manual of the public
relations industry back in the 1920s
which is very much worth reading
remember I'm not talking about the right
wing here this is way at the left
liberal end of American politics
his book is called on propaganda or
maybe just propaganda I should mention
that terminology changed during the
Second World War prior to the Second
World War the term propaganda was used
quite openly and freely for controlling
the public mind it got bad connotations
during the second world war because of
Hitler and that sort of thing so the
term was dropped and now there's other
terms used but if you read the
literature in the social sciences and
the public relations industry and so on
back in the say 20s and the 30s they
describe what they're doing as
propaganda this manual is for the rising
public relations industry and he opens
by pointing out that the conscious
manipulation of the organized habits and
opinions of the masses is the central
set is the essential feature of a
democratic society it's the essence of
democracy as he later pointed out and he
said we have the means to carry this out
now he said we have the means to
Regt people
minds as efficiently as armies regiment
their bodies and we must do this first
of all it's the essential feature of
democracy but also sort of footnote it's
the way to maintain power structures and
authority structures and wealth and so
on roughly the way it is it's worth
remembering something else that they
usually don't teach you very much about
in school and that is if you back to the
origins of American society it was
founded on the principle that was stated
very explicitly by the leading framer
James Madison at the constitutional
conventions that the as he put it the
primary responsibility of government is
to protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority I and Madison
recognized a smart guy that this was
going to be a serious problem if a
democratic system were established it
was going to if people had the right to
vote he used England as his model
England was the model for democracy in
those days right it's like talking 1780s
and he pointed out and the debates on
the Constitutional Convention something
which everybody would have read in third
grade in a free society I mean this is
the origins of our society you know he
pointed out that in England if they had
the right to vote which fortunately they
didn't he said pretty soon you would
find people calling for redistribution
of property and for a tax on property
rights for what nowadays we call
agrarian reform was mostly an
agricultural society he didn't use the
term agrarian or form but same thing he
said people will start calling for
agrarian reform obviously that's
intolerable and we have to protect our
own society against that kind of
injustice by protected by ensuring that
the rights of property prevail he
recognized that he said it's problem now
he was already concerned in the 1780s by
what he called symptoms of a leveling
spirit that is people are trying to
you know feel that property oughta more
equitably distributed that's a danger
but he said that the danger is going to
become much more severe over time as
more and more people are marginalized
and dispossessed and secretly yearn for
a more a equal distribution of life's
blessings now if those people get the
vote we're going to be in trouble
because it's going to be hard to protect
the minority the opulent against the
majority which is what governments all
about and he therefore designed the
constitutional system which was intended
to prevent that danger the system the
way he set it up he and the other
framers but was virtually unanimous
virtually no disagreement about this the
the one person who might have disagreed
Jefferson was not part of any of this
stuff the he the constitutional system
as he designed it was supposed to put
power in the hands of the wealthy who
are the more capable set of men I'm
quoting and power must reside in the
hands of the wealthy the more capable
set of men with the general population
fragmented factionalized dispersed you
know in conflict and so on and so forth
well this is like we're now 1780s ok
it's in a pretty stable system and as
it's been harder as the franchise has
increased so over time more and more
people did get the right to vote and
that just raised the danger
furthermore the the power of the state
to coerce by violence by this and that
includes the power of private power like
the power of say Carnegie to hire
migrants and so on as that has declined
the need to resort to these other method
measures of factional ization instilling
hatred marginalizing people straight
propaganda and so on that's increased
and very consciously so by the time you
get to the 1920s where I started from
it's recognized that huge resources must
go into the conscious manipulation of
the organized habits and opinions of the
masses now we have to regiment them
their minds as well as an army regiments
their bodies and we have the methods for
it and those methods are advertising
entertainment straight propaganda and
the media schools so on and so forth the
20s was an important period in this
regard it looks as if labor is under
attack now but remember in the 20s it
had been smashed the major American
historian of labor historian David
Montgomery has a book which you probably
know or should if you don't call the
halt the Fall of the House of labor very
young source standards important book on
history of the labor movement it ends in
the 1920s because that's when the house
of labor had fallen and after with a lot
of violence in that case state violence
Wilson's Red Scare the leading labor
leader was in jail Eugene Debs where the
New York Times it said years ago I ought
to be sent and so on it was there had
been a big strike wave in the during the
at the end of the First World War
smashed labor movement destroyed the
whole thing wiped out as Montgomery
points out at the end of his book labor
had been virtually destroyed working
people had to privatize their lives and
aspirations they sort of work out
survival strategies for themselves not
with others because the modes of
cooperation and common struggle had been
eliminated and they did it he ends up by
saying you know in a most undemocratic
America which is true it was a highly
undemocratic country using a combination
of modes of violence and coercion and
repression and increasingly propaganda
to prevent the dangers that Madison was
worrying about you know almost two
hundred years earlier that more and more
people would secretly sigh for
a better better access to life's
blessings and might even do something
about it if they had a functioning
democracy which therefore couldn't be
permitted
I should just comment in fairness to
James Madison
but this these remarks are not quite
correct the reason was that Madison was
pre-capitalist
he's like just about everybody you know
Adam Smith you know all the great
figures from the Enlightenment they're
mostly pre-capitalist and very
anti-capitalist in conception you know
you can't say they're anti-capitalist
because there was no modern industrial
capitalism around for them to have an
opinion about and this is a matter of
interpretation you know not how you read
text so you can read them a lot of
different ways but the way I read them
they were very anti-capitalist that
includes Adam Smith and I think you can
demonstrate that but certainly Madison
was he believed that when he put power
in the hands of the wealthy class of men
you know the more capable set of men the
wealthy of the country that they were
going to be as he put it
enlightened statesmen and benevolent
philosophers who would devote themselves
to the welfare of all okay that's a very
pre-capitalist conception you know that
once you give power to the hands of the
rich they're just going to be benevolent
philosophers and they're going to devote
themselves you know every minute of
their day to the welfare of everyone
else I mean it's like what corporate
executives tell you you know they're
sort of understand enough to say that
but by now nobody I suppose nobody
believes except the people who read
these you know watch these movies which
show you how it works in those days
Madison really believed it and he very
quickly discovered that it wasn't true
within a few years but listen I think
1792 he was already very upset about the
fate of this democratic experiment which
he thought was failing he condemned what
he called the daring depravity of the
time
the business leaders who have now been
given power used that power he said to
become the tools and tyrants of
government they overwhelm government
with their powers and combinations and
they're bribed by its largesses and
they're just serving self-interest you
know not the interest of the general
public and he thought I was deplorable
and the so on but that's because in the
end that he perceived the way the system
that he had designed was actually
functioning
that description you know rhetoric is
kind of nice some people don't use fancy
rhetoric like that today but it's a
perfect description of today what's
called the industrial capitalist system
today is in fact one in which private
power is the tool and tyrant of
government overwhelms it by it's
combinations it's bribed by its
largesses that's a pretty good
description of 1997 with all the changes
that have taken place in 1792 there's a
good deal of stability to all this
including the commitment to the
principle that the primary goal of
government is to protect the minority
the opulent from the majority read
yesterday's budget proposal carefully
and you'll get a good example of how
that commitment plays itself out and the
increasingly significant idea increase
overwhelmingly significant idea
particularly among liberals you know
like Sade Bern is that it is necessary
to control people's minds because there
are too much of a danger the end we as
one of the leading take a look at say
the encyclopedia of social sciences in
big encyclopedia in 1933 so this is
still pretty second world war there's an
entry that is an entry on propaganda
remember propaganda was a usable
permanent and the entry on propaganda is
written by a very distinguished
political scientist liberal political
scientist Harold Lasswell one of the
founders of modern political science in
fact of communications and so on and
it's worth reading the pager to you know
he rocks it out and read it he says
these are paraphrases but they're pretty
close to quote the he says that we must
not succumb to democratic dogmatism
about people being the best judges of
their own interests they are not you
know we're the best judges of their
interests we smart guys and we must
therefore ensure that those idiots out
there don't get into trouble you know by
actually using their theoretical right
to vote to interfere where they don't
belong like in the public arena so we
got to keep them out of the public arena
somehow and make sure that it's just us
smart guys who are in there now it's for
their good of course it's kind of like
you don't let you know your three year
old my case grandchild run across the
street you know because she may want to
run across the street but beyond
improper to let her have that choice and
the same is true about the masses they
have to be controlled they have to be
controlled at the workplace they have to
be kept out of the political arena
they're not going to understand the need
to protect the minority the op1 against
the majority they're going to have all
these strange leveling impulses and
they're going to do all kind of things
which will you know mess the world up in
all sorts of horrible ways so for their
benefit we have to regiment their minds
the way in army regiments their bodies
ensure that they're under control make
it very clear that they don't
participate in workplace management and
certainly not in the political arena
they're to be outside somewhere and the
dedication with it with which this task
has been pursued is pretty awesome
I if you I mean just to take a right
after the fall of the House of labor in
the 1920s when American labor really was
smashed and people were privatized and
tried to accommodate individually to a
most undemocratic America as Montgomery
and others have pointed out at that was
a time when there was great sort of you
know about the end of history and the
taupey of the masters and it's all over
you know us good guys at one everybody
else's at our feet kind of like some of
the stuff you read the day I and it sort
of looked like that you know it's pretty
much looked that way well a few years
laters you know the whole thing
collapsed and there was militant working
class struggle and all sorts of other
popular activism and there had to be an
accommodation be some kind of
accommodation to the to these unwashed
masses who were getting out of line
sit-down strikes and all sorts of things
and there was indeed there was this
fragile social compact that the
Doug Fraser referred to was indeed
established I wasn't in a gift you know
it was won by struggle and the meaning
the labor laws and the limited social
system in fact American workers back in
the 1930s began to get the rights that
had been standard long before even in
much more brutal societies you read the
right-wing British press over the say
early part of the century they can't
believe how bad American workers are
treated the same was true of visitors
from Australia and so on
by the 1930s the US was sort of brought
into the more or less the mainstream of
industrial society on these matters to a
limited extent in fact but the some
extent and that caused hysteria among
the masters so you read the business
press by 1936 or 37 again these are
things which in a really free society
everybody would study in elementary
school because they're really important
that these give the real framework of
the society in my view the they were
talking about the hazard facing
industrialists and the rising political
power of the masses and how we must do
something to save ourselves or our way
of life will be gone and we know a lot
of time to do it they started right away
by the late 30s there was a big anti
labor campaign that had built up its
with new techniques you know there was
still use of force but it was understood
that that's not going to work the way it
did so there was a shift to more
propaganda community Oregon that the
main idea it's called a Johnston the
Mohawk Valley formula I guess it was
cool something like that yeah Mohawk
Valley formula was designed by a lot of
public relations hotshots around 3637 at
the time of some of the steel strikes to
have a new what they called scientific
methods of strike breaking we don't just
come in you know with clubs and shoot
people and smash their heads and that
sort of thing we do it the scientific
way because the old way didn't work
anymore and the scientific methods of
strike breaking were in fact drawn from
the public relations ideas of the kind
that I talked about the main idea was to
mobilize the community against the
strikers and the union activists to
present a picture which is by now so
standard that you can hardly turn on the
tube without seeing it because it's just
poured out and
like streams ever since then
the basic idea is to present a picture
of the world that looks kind of like
this there's there's us you know kind of
big happy family in the community the
you know the honest workman going off
every morning with his lunchbox his
loyal wife who's making the meals and
taking care of the kids the hard-working
executive who's toiling day and night
and the interests of you know his
workers in the community the friendly
banker who's running around looking for
people to lend money to and so on and so
forth that's us
you know and we're all in harmony
harmony was a big word we're in harmony
we're all together it's Americanism you
might take a look at that word
Americanism it's an unusual term it's
the kind of term that you only find in
totalitarian societies as far as I know
so like in the Soviet Union anti-soviet
ISM was considered the gravest of all
crimes you know and the Brazilian
generals had some concept like that anti
Brazilian but try say publishing a book
on anti Italian ISM and see what happens
in the streets of Rome or Milan people
won't even bother laughing so ludicrous
idea the idea of Italian ISM or you know
Norway ism or something like that or
it's just the obvious ridicule and
societies that have some kind of residue
of a democratic culture inside people's
heads I don't mean in the formal system
but in totalitarian societies it is used
and as far as I know the United States
is the only free society that has such a
concept maybe there's another one if it
might try it in place as you know but
anyhow Americanism is an anti
Americanism and unamerican ism and so on
these are concepts which go along with
harmony and getting rid of those
outsiders and all that kind of stuff
another part is simply to induce hatred
hatred fear among people so it's a
diverse society you know you go to
Europe most places are pretty uniform
this is a very diverse society so it's
easy for propagandists it's pretty easy
to get people to you know hate the guy
next door because looks a little
different there
thing or another and huge campaigns go
on to instigate divisions among people I
don't tell you about this it's all so
familiar you go on but but these are
very natural techniques of social
control if you can't control people by
force you have to control their minds
you have to control their attitudes yeah
exactly like they say well going back to
the Mohawk Valley formula the idea was
to move into a community flood it with
where there's a strike going on flood it
with propaganda you know take over the
media the churches the schools I mean
everywhere else pour in this propaganda
about harmony and so on the way I
described it and then there's those bad
guys out there we're trying to disrupt
our harmonious lives you know like that
union organizer is probably a communist
and anarchist anyway and the probably
unamerican than these China's you know
destroy all these wonderful things we
have and we got a band together and kick
him out you know we have to defend their
way of life against this a lot of
religion gets thrown in remember that
the United States an extremely
fundamentalist country I mean you look
comparatively comparative statistics it
usually religious fundamentalism
declines as industrialization goes up
it's very close correlation the United
States is off the chart you know it
ranks with devastated peasant societies
probably more fundamentalist than Iran
there's all why this is so is I don't
know but I'm in fact complicated
question but one factor is that it was
certainly consciously fomented by
business leaders that goes way back to
the 19th century when they were
supporting their favorite I mean John D
Rockefellers favor and evangelist was a
hoot a lot of money in through some guy
who said that people ought to have more
enlightened ideas than labor agitation
that was one of his famous phrases and
the more enlightened ideas are you know
go to church and listen to orders and
you know do what they tell you and shut
up you know that's the more enlightened
ideas and it's a really interesting case
because the Mohawk Valley was the model
that was later used for strike breaking
and destruction of the labor movement in
the post-war period so it's quite
interesting to see what happened right
there instantly I don't know any
literature on this do you yeah um it's
these these are untouchable topics you
know and you can almost say that
anything that's important you know it's
going to matter for people's lives it's
got to be sort of off the agenda and it
sort of makes sense you don't want
people to know about it like you don't
want people to know the wrong kind of
thing after all that makes sense you
know it's like it's not a conspiracy or
anything it's just common sense if you
have a certain degree of power and
authority and privilege you just don't
want people to know things that might be
harmful to them because they're really
like children remember and we're the
ones who have to make the decisions for
there's an enormous amount of money and
effort goes into this it's not the only
thing but any means there's a lot of
other reasons why the United States is
so unusual in this respect but this is
one of them and it's used I mean whether
that's the source or not it's certainly
used you know always another technique
of trying to create the marginalization
of people the removing people from the
actual social and political struggles
that might make their lives better
you know maybe they and to keep them
from working with one another by
dividing them up in all sorts of ways
and in a myriad techniques you know find
the fashion to keep the hated masses
with out of the public arena where they
don't belong and certainly out of
anything having do with control of the
economic system where it's unthinkable
that they should have a role that's got
to be in the hands of private tyrannies
that's unquestionable where the United
States has acted internationally it's
the same way you look at the trail of
intervention it's almost always the same
not just third world countries for
example like I just came back from Italy
okay you may not know this but Italy was
the target of the major CIA activities
since its origins the internal record
runs dry around the mid 70s so don't
know can't say after that but from the
origin of the CIA in 1947 up to at least
the mid 70s Italy seems to have been
targeted more than any other country in
an effort to undermine Italian democracy
Italy was regarded as sort of a third
semi third world country had a very
strong labor movement and when the
American army in fact the American
British Army's what they did what they
called liberating Italy in 1943-44 they
were appalled to discover that northern
Italy had been liberated by the
resistance which had established
functioning society with very strong
labor control the resistance was mostly
labor and peasant based they held off
the Germans had liberated most of the
place
they had instituted labor worker
management in factories they had thrown
out what were called the what these
Americans and British they had they were
protecting workers but they call now
speaking for the terminology of the u.s.
British documents they were keeping
useless workers and throwing out
arbitrarily dismissing owners and bosses
and that's of course intolerable and the
system was functioning I further where
they were focusing on unemployment which
was recognized was Italy's major problem
but that's their problem not our problem
our problem is to restore the
traditional structure which meant
traditional hierarchies actually it
meant restoring fascist structures and
fascist collaborators and so on and our
big effort was made to do that and it
was did not entirely successful by 1948
when the first election took place it
looked as if labor based forces would
probably win and a huge effort went into
trying to ensure that that wouldn't
happen by withholding food Italy was
starving by restoring the police -
fascist control by all sorts of threats
and manipulation greed big operation and
the first major CIA operation among
others and they took it really seriously
again something you would learn in a
free society is this thing called the
National Security Council you know which
the main planning outfit which publishes
doesn't publish but it produces
documents top-level planning documents
which are among not the only important
ones but among the most important ones
they tend to get released maybe thirty
five years later so you can look back at
them so we have them now from the late
40s and the first one
NSC one 1947 is devoted to Italy and it
calls for it says you know we're going
to try all these measures to ensure that
Italy doesn't have a free democratic
government which would have they don't
say it this way but what amounts to that
which in which there'd be a big role for
the organized working class in Italy but
and they say but if this doesn't work
you know if the
minutes as they call them which means in
fact a lot of work nominees but if the
Communists come to power through a legal
vote for legal elections then the United
States is going to declare a national
emergency and is going to support
military activities inside Italy to
overthrow the democratically elected
government that's how seriously they
took it back in 1947 they also knew
exactly why the Communists were powerful
on you read it in the records
extensively because they were honest
because they were supporting
working-class interests it's true that
they were collaborationists they weren't
trying to separate Italy from the
Western alliance or anything but they
were defending working class interests
and people supported and I had a mass
based working class party there were
plenty of others besides Communists but
they had to be prevented either by
coercion like say withholding food and
violence or if that didn't work by
direct intervention military
intervention that was taken very
seriously and in fact it goes up to the
prison how is it the wealthy chin will
pull the wool over the eyes of the
American worker by controlling the power
and government I'm using it against the
working public use it against everything
well take right now let's say as an
example there's a couple days ago I
don't know if your father I put myself
through the pain of reading the New York
Times every day for some masochistic
reason which I won't try to explain but
the the they've got a you know their big
chief correspondence or the main thinker
is a guy named Thomas Friedman who had
an article three or four days ago in
which he big think piece in which he
said well he said the Cold War is over
so you know the breakdown isn't hawks
and doves anymore we have to have some
new breakdown and he said the new
breakdown he says there's two one is
between integrationists and
the other term I forget you know ante
integration is that means people who are
in favor of more globalization and what
they call free trade which is in free
trade and you know all that kind of
stuff and people who want to slow it
down or end it that's one break and the
other is between people who are in favor
of a safety net and those who think that
everybody what a you know be on your own
and get what you can okay so those are
the two ways people break up that gives
you four possible types of people right
two of them he sort of dismisses as
lunatics
so there's the Zapatistas and Ross Perot
they fit into two of those boxes the
other two boxes are sort of saying
people Clinton and Gingrich and I'll put
aside Gingrich Clinton but Gingrich and
gets right to your point I think
Gingrich is put in the corner that says
integrationist and that will take the
hindmost you know everybody for
themselves
well that's testable you know it's
testable that that's Gingrich is
position for example on the question of
whether Gingrich's and integrationist
like in favor free trade we can ask how
he reacted when the Reagan
administration instituted the greatest
wave of protectionism since the 1930s
that's just straight protectionism
alongside of huge increase in public
subsidies to private power to industry
along with say the biggest
nationalization in American history to
take over continental Illinois Bank and
so on and so forth that's all radically
an integrationist okay had Newt Gingrich
react we can ask that question answer is
he thought it's great
uh what about the safety net story I
mean Gingrich is in favor of the people
sort of being out there on their own you
know a rugged entrepreneurs and so on I
mean you can check that too he
represents the county district Cobb
County Georgia which happens to be that
and he happens to hold the national
championship in bringing federal
subsidies to his rich constituents to be
precise among suburban counties in the
United States Cobb County ranks third in
federal subsidies ranks right after
Arlington Virginia which is part of the
federal governments of course they get a
lot of federal subsidies like the
Pentagon's there and so on and Brevard
County Florida which is the home of the
Space Center so it's another part of the
federal government but if you move
outside the federal government itself
Gingrich's district is number one they
get more federal subsidies than anybody
the biggest employer in Cobb County is
Lockheed which is a publicly subsidized
private profit corporation they don't
you know I mean they sell plant
commercial planes but those are just as
everyone knows they're just you know
kind of they use military technology is
that the way the system is designed
technology is developed under the guise
of the military and then hand it over to
private power when when it works let's
draw everything airplanes computers the
internet you name it and cobb county is
right center this well he's in favor of
being you know you all out on your own
and fighting in this harsh world
ridiculous he's the biggest welfare
freak in the country that's literally
true except that he wants the welfare to
go to very rich people notice this is
not what's called corporate welfare the
corporate wealth what they call
corporate welfare which also never gets
touched to some different category
completely that's like giving a special
you know shot in the arm to some
particular corporation this is something
quite different this is the way in which
our economy works the way our economy
works take any done just about any
dynamic sector of it you know
least that I know and I've studied and
you find that it's based on massive
public subsidy and privatization of
profit public pays the costs and takes
the risks and private systems make the
profit if there is any Cobb County is
just an extreme example of this
not you ask how come people are deluded
well how often do you read this you know
I mean like these aren't particularly
subtle facts I mean these are like
glaringly obvious fact but ok because
the reason is because people like Thomas
Friedman and everyone else in the
business knows you're not supposed to
write about these things I mean I don't
know I'm not claiming he thinks about it
you know in fact the people who write
about it are probably more deeply
propagandized that even than the people
they're talking to you know you cannot
be a good propagandist unless it's in
your bones
I mean it's extremely hard to lie I
think we all know that from personal
experience you know it's hard the light
of people every one of us lies to people
all the time unless we're some kind of
crazy angels but the way we do it if you
I mean I'm sure you know this is you
first convince yourself that what you're
saying is true you know like you're you
know you're eight year old you're an
eight year old kid and you steal a toy
from your brother you know and your
mother comes in and yells at you you
don't say well you know I wanted to do
and he had it so you know I took it
because I'm stronger than him what you
say is it really wasn't his and besides
he'd taken it too in mind and anyway I
needed more than he did so it was right
for me to take okay I you know I'm if
people that haven't had that experience
there are some other species I think but
that kind of experience goes all the way
up to being a hotshot journalist for the
New York Times you know you don't even
make it into those circles unless you're
already so deeply overwhelmed by
doctrine and propaganda that you can't
even think in other terms and so you'll
read say you know liberal columnist in
New York Times very angrily saying when
people talk like this nobody tells me
what to write I write anything I feel
like which is absolutely true and if
they didn't if you know people with real
power weren't sure that they were going
to say the right things they wouldn't be
in a position to write anything they
feel like
well how does that work you know it
starts from childhood it starts in the
in kindergarten on television
there's selection for obedience from the
very first moment you just think about
I'm guessing maybe I'm wrong so you
don't become wrong but at least when I
think about my own school experience or
any other school experience I know about
there was selection for obedience I mean
I ended up going to the fancy colleges
like this place and the way I did it was
I know exactly how I did it by shutting
up you know like if I thought that the
high school teacher was a horse's ass
which I did most of the time I didn't
say hey what you're saying actually
sometimes I did got thrown out of class
but I learned not to say anything just
say okay you know I'll do the next
stupid assignment and because I know
that that's the way I get ahead and
ultimately I'll do this and that all
right and you know you if you're having
you know whatever ability it takes to do
this kind of thing and you are
sufficiently disciplined and passive you
sort of make it through up to the higher
echelon there are people who don't I
mean I I know something like somebody on
kids just didn't and they get into
trouble
they're called behavior problems or you
know disruptive or you stick drugs in
them or something or other because
they're just too independent you know
and people who are independent or pain
in the neck you know they disrupt the
system and then they're going to be cut
off one way or another I can tell you
just you know at graduate school
teaching mostly graduate school you read
applications you can detect between the
lines when the person who's writing a
recommendation is telling you keep away
from this person they're going to cause
you trouble which means usually they're
going to go off and do the wrong thing
or something like that it's it's I I
don't want to exaggerate in the sciences
it's somewhat different and the reason
is the science that simply require this
kind of independence they'll die
you know unless people are challenging
all the time and questioning so when you
look at people who are say studying
physics at MIT or something yeah
it's totally different because you just
encourage people to be challenging and
creative and so on and so forth but in
most areas you don't you you want them
to be passive and obedient and
supportive and to fit their you know to
fit some kind of niche inside a
managerial system which is top down and
then make too much of a fuss and so on
and the people who don't accept this
they're weeded out and one or another
fish so it's a tricky question I don't
mean to suggest there's an easy answer
to your question if there is I don't
know it but it seems to be then awful
out of our whole system of the kind of
thought control by that I mean education
you know television family life all
sorts of things is sort of geared to
supporting that kind of passivity and
institutions will break out of it as the
labor movement does they are subject to
a lot of their crushed insofar as one
can question I mean the labor movement
always broke out of this its picture was
always different from the very beginning
you go back to the beginnings of the
labor movement it's you know farmers
bitterly opposing the degrading and
oppressive modes of industrial
capitalist organization that we're being
forced on them actually one of the most
interesting books I know and if you
haven't read it I urged you to is the
first modern book on labor history that
I know of by a guy named Norman where
around 1924 it was just reprinted so
it's easy to get but it's about the
labor movement in eastern Massachusetts
around 1850 and 60 it's mostly quotes
from the labor press which are just
fascinating
it's mostly young women from the farms
what they called factory girls like
eighteen-year-old kid comes in from the
farms and she's working on the mills and
lowell or artisans and in boston you
know and people like that they they're
unpressed they have very lively
extensive press big in fact it's like
the scale of the commercial press in
those days
that's very interesting I mean it's very
eloquent very well-written
they took for granted as the labor
movement always has unless it's beaten
out of people's heads that those who
work in the mills ought to own them they
regarded industrial capitalism as just
another form of slavery this is without
you know no marks no socialism you know
no foreign radicals none of that stuff
it's all just working people from their
own experience you know very literate
incidentally likely one of the things
they complained about was that their
culture was being taken away from like
an artisan in Boston if he had the lexer
money would hire a boy to read to him
and that meant read classics you know
they and they regarded the they said
look the values that we fought for in
the American Revolution they're being
taken away from us we're being forced
into another kind of tyranny which we
don't want namely the tyranny of the
hierarchic industrial system and they
also opposed the what they called the
new spirit of the age this is like 1850
the new spirit of the age is gained
wealth for getting all but self okay
over here that one little fancier but
the same thing that is drilled in
everyone's head every day today you know
you got to gain wealth forgetting about
everybody else well they were trying to
drill it into people's heads in 1850 and
they were resisting it because it's
degrading you know it's not the way
human beings are it takes a long time to
drive normal human sentiments out of
people's heads and they keep popping up
again and in fact I think at least looks
to me the whole history of the labor
movement is a struggle against the new
spirit of the age well that's one of the
reasons it's constantly repressed and
other independent efforts are also
constantly repressed not always
successfully like the world's a lot
better than it was 100 years ago or 50
years ago for that matter because these
struggles tend to you know they get
repressed but they leave a residue
they have successes and they're beaten
back and then they go on from those
successes and over time it's already
gets better
structures that are based on Authority
and dominance will try to repel just
normally act with anybody even thinking
about it to block such tendencies now
sometimes they think about it like in
these in the manuals of the public
relations industry they think about it
very harsh but you know they're putting
out the billions of dollars a year to
control the public mind better think
about what you're doing but most of the
time you don't think about it you're
just part of it no like you don't think
about the fact that when you go through
school you're being trained for
obedience and passivity but I think if
you look back you'll probably least if
you're like my experience will recognize
that that happened and when you watch
television let's say if you know some
sitcom you don't think well I'm being
exposed to the Mohawk Valley formula but
you are I mean that's the picture of
life that's presented day after day
after day on you know like people have
personal problems or something like that
but nothing that would bring them
together to work for some you know to
struggle against the new spirit of the
age
I mean it's last time you saw a sitcom
about that and in fact what you what you
get is this exists us that flows out of
the PR industry very consciously no I
mean that in that case mostly conscious
another aspect of it is demonizing labor
so a major element in the huge public
relations propaganda after the Second
World War you know was strictly
demonizing labor and the labor movement
knew that there was a fairly substantial
labor press even then as late as the
1950s there were still about eight
hundred labor newspapers which are
reaching maybe twenty or thirty million
people a week you know not commercial
media but pretty substantial and they're
interesting reading to they were struck
they were trying to as they put it
provide this is just I'm not talking
about anything radical you know it's
like no left-wing press or anything just
labor newspapers you know the
conservative American labor movement
we're talking about developing added
oats to the poisons of the kept press
commercial media who were demonizing
labor at every opportunity and trying to
undermine our achievements and glossing
over the crimes of the corporate rulers
who run the society you know stuff like
that
is a good book on this one to the firt
is just tells you something about
American academic life
the first study that I've ever heard of
you know in the United States on this
major theme of modern history just
appeared University of Illinois press
book called selling free enterprise by a
woman named Elizabeth phones wolf fo NES
- wolf it's kind of a political but like
she doesn't have a phrase I can see any
special point of view but the material
and it is pretty revealing it's the next
part of the story that I was going to
get to this hazard facing industrialists
you know and the rising political power
of the masses that led to the Mohawk
Valley formula and so on that terrified
the daylights out of the business
community now it was kind of put on hold
during the second world war but it took
off immediately after the Second World
War at a huge scale instantly you know
and that's what she's talking about
selling free enterprise the idea was as
they put it remember that the United
States came out of the second world were
pretty social democratic like most of
the world you know like just like those
Italian workers who had to have ideas
about worker management beaten out their
head by force an awful lot of people in
the United States to like maybe half
thought that there ought to be popular
control over industry in some fashion
you know this is so exotic in the United
States that the fashion was never
described but somehow that the
government could do a better job than
private power things like that there was
an enormous support for social programs
you know medical programs and so on that
had to be beaten out of people's heads
and fast the leaders of the public
relations industry she quotes a lot on
they said look we have three to five
years to save our our way of life we
have to fight and quickly win what they
call the everlasting battle for the
minds of men and indoctrinate people
with a capitalist story so fully that
they can repeat it you know on every
opportunity and on and on like that and
they weren't kidding around I mean for
example about a third of the material in
American schools elementary schools was
coming straight out of corporate
propaganda offices by the early 50s
sports leagues were taken over the
churches were taken over the
universities were attacked and there was
across the board you know major effort
to try to win the everlasting battle for
the minds of men and it's still going on
you know I mean here it's conscious now
that part of its conscious most of it is
most of the participants it's just you
know it's in your bones
I mean you've gone through the
especially if you've been through in a
lead educational system and you know
then it's you're really deeply
indoctrinated in it so I should be my on
how to measure this is my pet like
personal feeling is that you find more
passivity and obedience in the elite
centers than you do like you know on the
streets or in state colleges well you
know Adam Smith once you're supposed to
worship Him but not read him you know
what's worth reading so he wants
remarked somewhere that if you find two
businessmen talking to each other
they're involved in a conspiracy against
the public you know something like that
and yeah there's something to that but
you know it's not as though I mean there
you can read descriptions like what
you're saying incidentally in the
business press so for example in the
Financial Times in London which is like
the main you know the most important
business newspaper in the world a couple
of years ago they had an article by the
economics correspondent of the BBC you
know it's all very establishment stuff
in which he said that something like
this that what's evolving is what he
called a de-facto world government in a
new imperial age and the de facto world
government is a set of shadowy
institutions under the area's or another
thereof general what they're doing which
basically served the interests of
transnational capital and financial
institutions and he said for example the
g7 you know the seven big rich countries
meaning just their executives and their
leadership nobody else knows what
they're doing the IMF the World Bank you
know then the GATT council now would be
the World Trade Organization and yeah
they get together and they're running
the world government I think that's kind
of a you know it's kind of a metaphor I
mean like it's not that they get
together somewhere and say okay here's
what we're going to do they do get
together but it's usually extremely
boring like if you were unfortunate
enough to have gone to this Davos
conference the other day I'm sure you
would have been bored out of your mind I
mean I can go and I didn't see the
document but having read things like I
did I do a lot of reading of this stuff
like the trilateral commission is one of
them and they publish regular documents
so boring I mean after after a couple of
years I stopped subscribing you know
it's so predictable and boring and
pablum and so on and so forth and
besides you can read it in foreign
affairs or the you know the organized
business page wherever you want any day
but yes they do get together and
sometimes when things get scary they
really do things so say take the
trilateral commission the one
publication of theirs which really is
interesting and worth reading this is
the Commissioner was put together by
David Rockefeller around 1973 and it's
one of the ones that people refer to
when they talk about this you know
secret nexus of rulers and so on
although as I say is mostly a bore but
in 1975 the first publication was very
interesting and I urge you to read it if
you haven't done it it's called the the
crisis of democracy and it's very much
in line with the kind of stuff I was
talking about before remember this is
after this is first getting together
after the 60s okay all this ferment went
on in the 60s which you know women and
minorities and all kind of people are
supposed to be kept in their place we're
suddenly trying to get into the public
arena and do something about their
interests and that again drove people
crazy just as as did the working-class
struggles in the 30s so here you have a
gathering of a Leeds trilateral means
United States Europe and Japan so these
are elite elements mostly liberal on the
liberal side incidentally like if you
look at the composition it's around
roughly speaking around Carter Democrats
fact the whole Carter Administration
including Carter himself was drawn from
this group that's roughly the complexion
both in all in all three of the
and they were concerned about what they
called the crisis of democracy and it's
interesting to read what they said
because at that point they were
concerned the crisis of democracy is the
fact that normally passive and
marginalized parts of the population the
overwhelming majority are suddenly
coming trying to get into the public
arena to press their demands well you
know like if you believe the stuff they
teach you in civics classes that's
supposed to be democracy but if you're
smart enough to have made it to Harvard
you know that that's the crisis of
democracy we got to stop it and in fact
the the the American reporter you know
the guy who wrote the u.s. part of it is
a professor at Harvard shortly after he
got one of my favorite titles he was
called professor of the science of
Government at Harvard I've always liked
that one uh Sam Huntington yeah he I
think he's now a university professor or
something but his he was he wrote the
American side of this trilateral thing
but the others are more or less the same
I don't mean it's just he's different I
think he's a kind of like a New Deal
Democrat or something probably isn't he
something like that you know he's like
this is what I'm talking about Jesse
Helms okay this is the there in fact he
gave his ideal described the good old
days sort of let his hair down a little
is that in the in the good old days he
said before the crisis of democracy
he said Truman had been this is almost a
quote Truman had been able to run the
country with the help of a few Wall
Street lawyers and fin and Sears okay
that's that alleged conspiracy you're
talking about of course he's
exaggerating you know it wasn't just
Truman and a bunch of Wall Street
lawyers infinite seers but that's the
image that would be perfect we had that
there'd be no crisis of democracy but
when you have women and blacks and young
people and old people and farmers and
all these scum trying to get into the
public arena yeah that's a problem
exactly the problem that Madison worried
about in fact so you got to somehow
marginalize them all right in this case
they were public I mean it is public in
a way I mean that is you can read it you
got to work a little to find it but and
it's worth reading but most of the stuff
is
it's very boring it's like it's like the
literature of social science hard hard
work I mean you got to do it if you feel
a duty you know most of the countries in
the world have normal bilateral
relations with Cuba why is the US
virtually alone in its hostility toward
Cuba what explains US policy let me just
report again some truisms that you would
read all over the front pages of the
newspapers if they if there was any
commitment to trying to tell important
and uncontroversial truths there's
nothing I'm going to say that's in the
least controversial but let me just run
let's run through the history because
it's interesting Cuba was the first
foreign policy problem for the United
States goes back to the 1820s this is no
new thing back in the 1820s the nice
guys like Thomas Jefferson and so on who
were planning to take over the
hemisphere you know I saw a Cuba is the
next place to pick up ok they'd already
stolen Florida from its inhabitants
claiming to have taken it from the
Spanish but actually from its
inhabitants and their eyes were now kind
of moving toward the West but also on
Cuba that was the next prize well it was
a little problem the British fleet you
know there was a British deterrent just
as in the 1960s there was a Soviet
deterrent and in fact the British were
the hated enemy in those days mainly
because of their power they were
preventing the United States from
expanding like they prevented the United
States from conquering Canada a couple
of times which the US has been trying to
do since 1775 and may have finally
achieved in the so-called free trade
agreement but but yeah Cuba was sitting
right there you know it's a valuable
place he couldn't get there because the
British are in the way John Quincy Adams
I guess it was suggested that we just be
patient he said it'll drop into our
hands like a ripe fruit by the laws of
political gravitation okay meaning by
the time we get stronger and the Brit
get weaker will things will shift around
we'll be able to take it over okay by
the end of the century that had happened
by the end of the century the British
were sort of being pushed out of the
game the United States was getting more
powerful and during something that is
sort of ludicrously missed title the
spanish-american war the United States
intervened in Cuba primarily to prevent
it from liberating itself from Spain
they take a close look that's an
interpretation so you want to make sure
you know don't take my word for it but I
think if you look you'll find that what
happened is that the intervention in
Cuba was primarily an effort to make
sure that its liberation from Spain
didn't mean liberation and in fact Cuba
was quickly turned into an American
plantation with all kind of restrictions
on its options and you know bought up by
American agribusiness and so on and so
forth when Cuba tried any funny ideas
about moving towards independence it was
smashed down for example Franklin
Roosevelt is famous for the good
neighbor policy we don't intervene
anymore in the affairs of our neighbors
well take a look at 1934 when Cuba made
the mistake of trying to elect a sort of
I guess moderate social democratic more
or less independent ideas as president
that's going too far
okay so out the and that's how it
continues up through 1959 okay 1959
Castro comes along there was a little
bit of toying with the question of
whether we can in court maintain the new
Cuba in our system or not and this is
not a new policy issue remember its back
the 1820s hasn't changed much within a
couple of months it was decided that
Castro is too big for his britches
there's no Russians incidentally he's
anti-communist you know packing his
jailing members of the Communist Party
there was no question of the Russians or
the Communists or any of this kind of
stuff by late 1959 u.s. planes already
bombing Cuba from Florida bases the
State Department claims they didn't know
about it
okay but I mean try try that if say
Cuban Plains mom the United States you
know and say well okay the Cubans didn't
know about okay so but it was happening
by in March 1960 the Eisenhower
administration made a formal decisions
now it was secret but now it's
Declassified so you can find out about
it they made the formal decision to
overthrow the Cuban government and take
it over that's March 1960
remember no Cold War no Russians no
communists just independent Cuba from
that point on March 1960 up until today
Cuba has been subjected to extensive
international terrorism economic
strangulation without an end and it's
not trivial stuff just to give you one
small example this one comes from an
absolutely impeccable source raymond
guard huff who's very conservative and
respected historian right inside the CIA
and the intelligence apparatus now
writes historical work on all the stuff
take a look at his books on reflections
on the missile crisis which is writing
sort of partially from the inside partly
from as a historian why the little item
in there somewhere we're at the peak of
the missile crisis you know before it
you know when it had sort of
theoretically been solved but it was
still was not over so like the missiles
were still there at the peak of the
missile crisis one of the operate when
the mongoose teams these terrorist teams
that the Kennedy had scented the Cuba to
smash the place up one of them which is
apparently acting out of control at the
time like there's no evidence that
Kennedy had order to do this but so
maybe was on its own but one of them
blew up a petrochemical plant in Cuba
which according to him he said he
doesn't verify it but he says it's
alleged and he apparently takes it
seriously the four hundred workers were
killed well suppose Cuba blew up a
factory in the United States and four
hundred people were killed think it
might make the newspaper in fact they'd
probably be nuke weed nuke them you know
okay but this is us and this is
incidentally one tiny footnote to a long
history of terrorism and this was right
at the peak of the Missile Crisis
when I supply no Cuba had its fingers on
the missiles I don't know that but
anyway somebody did okay now try just
for those of you who want to know about
why people believe what they do just
just do a little check and find out how
much information you can find that about
this okay I mean I've told you that I'll
save the trouble this is it I've
repeated it in probably 20 times and
books that nobody would dream of looking
at it reviewing and so on but that's one
little item and then it goes on to
poisoning crops and livestock and
shooting down fishing boats and strafing
hotels and you know blowing up airplanes
and all sorts of things
meanwhile the economic strangulation
goes on okay permanently now the only
issue debated in the United States for a
long time there was a pretense we got to
do this because of the Russians okay
because you know Cuba is a tentacle of
the Russian monster trying to strangle
us I mean in a in an intellectually free
country everybody would laugh in fact
when Kennedy once tried to get the
Mexican ambassador to join in some anti
Cuban action back in the early 60s the
Mexican ambassador actually told him you
know he'd like to do it but if he
announces it in public in Mexico that
Cuba's a threat he said forty million
Mexicans will die laughing okay well
that's and that's basically true I mean
the idea that Cuba could be a threat
even if it's armed by the Russians I
mean you know it's as if I mean like to
try to find on it came to think of a
counter but but let suppose say that
before the end of the Cold War Russia
had been carrying out massive terrorism
against Denmark and strangling the
country let's imagine it could do that
because it thread said that Denmark was
a threat well you know Denmark was way
more of a threat to Russia than Cuba is
to the United States
I mean Denmark's an advanced industrial
country it's it's a member of a hostile
military alliance you know well-armed
and the Russians that said that you
wouldn't laugh it would be a sign of
their lunacy and you know maybe
murdered them or something like that but
we say that all the time and that's okay
because that's us
you know we're properly indoctrinated to
just to judge how much of a Russian
threat it was bear in mind that the
formal decision to overthrow the
government was taken in March 1960 when
there's no Russians okay and it
continues under the pretext of a Russian
threat as long as the Russians were
around and then what happened when the
Russians disappeared okay so November
1989 Berlin Wall Falls no more Russians
what happened to Cuba I mean if the
story of the last 30 years that we hear
from Arthur Schlesinger and everyone was
true well we should have welcomed Cuba
with open arms
no more tentacles of the Russians that
what happened no we made the we made we
drew the noose tighter okay all of a
sudden it wasn't because the Russians
were threat it was because we love
democracy so much as you can easily
demonstrate by looking at what we do
around the world okay but sudden and and
if you take a look at the educated
classes take a look at the educated
classes they skip a beat from one day to
the next it's defending ourselves
against the Russian threat to loving
democracy okay with this history out in
the open now that's a real achievement I
doubt that a totalitarian state could
achieve anything like that anyhow up
until now it's well we love democracy so
much and then the only question is well
what's the best way to achieve democracy
is that the helms-burton Act or is it by
the Canadian Prime Minister going there
you know and this is discussed as if it
was serious that's the interesting part
I mean this is discussed as if you know
it's not 40 million American Mexicans
died laughing which it ought to be
now it's discussed as if it could
conceivably be serious it can't possibly
be serious the only question is how to
make sure that Cuba will go back into
the box in which it was supposed to be
put in eighteen twenty if they can force
it back there by one or another means
fine we'll accept Cuba will even call it
a democracy it's run by some brutal
murder you know like I told Mexico
democracy but we call Colombia democracy
in fact the best democracy in the
hemisphere even has an independent
political party you know which was
allowed to function in 1985
since that time about 3,000 of it
activists have been murdered mostly by
security forces and paramilitary forces
including every presidential candidate
and most of the mayors but you know
rights there's got to be democracy and
since we love democracy so much we think
it's fine
but it so maybe if Cuba ends up a
democracy like that it'll be fine as
long as it follows orders and you know
there ought to be 100 million Americans
who die laughing over this and the fact
that they're not is an indication of the
grip of the doctrinal system which is
really powerful and in this case
primarily among the more educated
sectors you know who I mean if they
don't know these things it's a conscious
decision not to know Peck's work not to
know these things like you don't have to
you know really explore that it's a
battle for the minds of the masses and
the fact that it's critical to mobilize
those masses to achieve any rights for
workers
do you see how many solutions short of
revolution sure I mean the solutions
that have worked all through history I
mean how did the how did workers rights
get established in the more or less in
the 1930s it was close no I mean there
was a threat there was certainly a
threat like when you know when working
people took over General Motors yeah
that's no joke people got scared yeah
okay because the next thing they'll come
to their heads is what do we need the
bosses for like maybe they'll get as
smart as the factory girls and Lowell
you know hundred fifty years ago and say
look we don't need those guys we'll run
it ourselves and you got to make sure
that that doesn't happen because that's
really trouble so yes there was a
accommodation and in fact right through
history that's the way it's worked I
mean we now every you know nowadays
people who consider themselves were less
progressive that term is supposed to
mean think that they got over pretty
rotten life look at our problems well
you know plenty of problems but it's a
lot better than it was thirty years ago
150 years ago or 100 years ago so like
nowadays you're worried about how to
defend some sort of protect some kind of
medical system worrying about that
thirty years ago there wasn't a or takes
a woman's rights okay plenty of problems
about women's rights like you know the
way firm ative actions being used to tax
people was it wasn't a problem thirty
years ago there was no right you know or
take a you know issue after issue it's
just things are overtime you know the
struggles take off on a higher level
than before so like the nineteenth you
think it looks bad for labor now have a
look at the 1920s you know the fall of
the house of labor in a most
undemocratic America when workers could
do nothing more than try to pursue
individual survival strategies and that
remember that was the period of mass
industrialization you know establishment
of the automobile industry and select
not as like not a rural country well
what you know what you do is try to keep
making things better
is it a revolution or not that's kind of
like a question of definition
I mean if it's possible I mean I think
myself I agree with those mill hands and
Massachusetts that the people who work
in the mills o2o know generalize well
alright if there steps toward that
happening I guess you could call it a
revolution but I don't see why it
shouldn't just happen I'm referring back
to your comments about the media and the
great public relations employ and see I
think all that stuff is totally
illegitimate I mean and that goes way
back to something much earlier why
should corporations have any rights at
all okay okay I mean that's not like
it's not in a constitution you know
corporate rights are the result it's not
even by legislation
I mean corporate rights were achieved
mostly through courts and lawyers and
pretty recently
you know the main decisions are early in
this century
look it's not founded you know it's not
graven in stone or anything like that
actually there's pretty good literature
on this if you're interested the best
book is by a Harvard professor that I
know a guy named Wharton Horowitz who's
at the Law School has a couple of books
called transformation of American law
one of them I think goes up till like
1860 and the other from maybe 1860 to
1960 but the main theme of the book of
the two these two big volumes is it's
interesting reading you know it sounds
kind of dense and so on but it's you
find interesting reading the main theme
is how the legal system was reshaped to
accommodate to the needs of private
power okay all the way through that's
been the main theme of the legal system
how to modify it so that illegitimate
tyrannical authority is given more and
more power undermining democratic
principles that's basically he doesn't
say those words that's what it comes
down to and the big step you know the
major step probably was the transfer of
rights to private tyrannies which is
what corporations are early in this
century and as he points out he didn't
go into it much this he really would I
think he's right this developed out of
ideas
kind of Hegelian ideas about the rights
of organic entities
individuals which are also at the roots
of Bolshevism and fascism and I should
mention that that comparison is may
sound exotic now but it wasn't along you
know sixty years ago you read say
mainstream American political economists
like Robert Brady important political
economists it's kind of Evelyn I back
around the night early nineteen forties
I guess he wrote books about you know
big businesses system power things like
that in which he points out how these
things are basically totalitarian and
structured you know in which they are so
where they get their rights well through
courts and lawyers by playing one state
against one another incidentally that's
something worth thinking about when you
listen to this devolution business now
the point of getting power down to the
states is so that any business even a
middle-sized business can make sure that
the money goes into their pockets not in
the pockets of poor people it's trickier
to do it at the federal level so that's
why you get all this new philosophy
about you know federalism and so on not
that federalism would be bad but you
know not when you've got private
tyrannies around this establishment of
private court of private corporate power
is a dramatic example of that backer
exactly what year but like early in this
century maybe around nineteen five or
something the state of New Jersey
figured it could make a killing by
getting the big corporations to move
from New York where they always were
over to New Jersey simply by giving them
a lot of gifts you know it's kind of
like when Alabama gets investment from
Germany sort of the taxpayers pay for it
but you know somebody makes a killing
that's and that's exactly what they did
so New Jersey gave corporations all
sorts of you know gifts essentially to
move across the river and that's why you
have so many things called you know
Standard Oil of New Jersey and that sort
of thing yeah because they moved across
the rivers they could be incorporated
there at and it's a lot cheaper for the
big power because the taxpayers of New
Jersey paid him Delaware was another
case well of course New York had to
accommodate
you know because everybody moving across
the river that's the new federalism back
at the early part of this century so
that's the and by such a mechanism
public funds did end up in big deep
private pockets and corporations
gradually got rights that they you know
that are happening in totally
illegitimate those rights can be taken
away very simply without a revolution in
fact every corporation has a state
charter I mean and they're supposed to
be there for some public good you know
well like it's it was true maybe 200
years ago like 200 years ago we could
like establish a corporation that would
like build a bridge across the Charles
River or something okay that's what a
corporation was supposed to be it's
changed a bit over the years by now they
are huge tyrannies I mean bigger than
states involved in all kind of strategic
interactions with one another in
violation of any conceivable princess
market principle and so on and so forth
there's no reason why they should exist
I don't think and the media is just part
of it
it's particularly harmful to democracy
when media systems are in the hands of
private tyrannies it's bad enough if the
guys who you know she's making shoes is
or cars that's bad enough but when it's
control over the doctrinal system and
information that's much worse that's why
I think the stuff that's going on in
telecommunications now is so should
really have a lot more attention than it
does I mean here's this huge system you
know built at public expense I mean you
guys paid for it you know
and as usual being handed over to
private power now that it's profitable
and it's very likely I think most media
analysts with their head screwed on see
and indeed even report that it's going
to end up in the hands of a half a dozen
mega corporations internationally
well that's worse than the oligopolies
that run steel and computers because
here we're talking about a new mode of
information and communication and so on
as always built at public expense and
right now we're in the middle of it
being handed over to private power and
certainly not being reported I mean like
it's not that there's no reporting like
you've heard about the
Telecommunications Act but it wasn't
discussed as a public interest issue it
was discussed as a business issue and in
fact most of the reporting was in the
business pages this is the big
legislative achievement of last Congress
you know talk Communications Act of 1996
I reported in the business pages and not
as a public interest issue like it's not
supposed to be a question of public
interest whether major systems of
information and the interchange are
handed over as gifts to Rupert Murdoch
that's not supposed to be an issue of
Public Interest the only thing that was
discussed was like to give it the six
corporations or 12 you know or do you do
it this way or that way well you know
that's effective indoctrination when
these ideas when these things don't even
occur to people takes real
indoctrination but yeah I think you're
right these are this is worse than the
handing over of decision-making power to
private tyrannies because in this case
it's also handing over
you know access to the things that
they're going to use for control of the
public mind these systems could also be
as deliberate people mad upon by
educational systems
k12 and the president just dropped it
but she put stuff but there's still a
lot of problems yeah I'm not sure how
good the good stuff is I'd ret I'd like
to I mean I haven't the details haven't
come out yet but from the reporting that
I've heard you know I've read maybe you
know more the actual proposals that are
going to come along are going to be
granting benefits of one kind or another
to people of income levels kind of like
mine you know people up to the level of
like you know eighty hundred thousand
dollars a year well you know what that I
forget the last figures but I think the
median income in the United States is
something like around thirty some now
the idea of giving rich people special
benefits so their kids can go to school
well okay who's paying you know well the
poor people are paying so I'm not so
sure it's such great stuff when you look
at it the same with other things you
know the big investment firms Lehman
Brothers in this case are now
circulating brochure those of you who
are wealthy enough must be receiving
these things you know they're
distributing brochures to their you know
rich customers telling them look we've
taken over the health system we've taken
over the crimp the criminal system you
know we're right now taken over the
welfare system we're enriching their
here's a new way to enrich ourselves at
public expense they don't not their
words you know this is my translation
the way we will do it is by setting up a
MOS okay educational management
organizations which will do wonders for
the educational system like HMOs do for
health care about the same in fact
namely they will be able to take more
and more money away from the system and
put
in private you know private power
meanwhile reduce a shaping care so that
it mostly benefits the rich in harms
everybody else and now we can do it for
the educational system the last big
government monopoly on this it's not put
this way it's all put in terms of
efficiency and what nice people we are
and we're going to make everything so
better much better for everyone like
because we're just benefactors and so on
but go through it and that's what it is
yeah I think those are probably the new
plans that will be coming along and I
would be very cautious about the
clintons proposals look at them really
carefully see to what extent they're
lending themselves after all remember he
is he is not he has made no secrets
about what he is I mean he is and always
has been a moderate Republican candidate
of the business community
he's never pretended to be anything else
you know never pretended to be anything
else he's a business candidate he his
main influence on the Democratic Party
was to move it over to the Republican
side with the Democratic Leadership
Council he never adds it's not like a
secret or anything he said it you know I
made it very clear his record in
Arkansas was like that his influence in
the national government was like that
so whatever the Democratic Party may
have been which you can sort of debate
it's now like if you can find a
difference between cloak Doland Clinton
I'd like to know what it was you know I
mean a policy difference
they're both moderate Republicans
instantly the business press is very
well aware of this
I mean it's take take a look at the Wall
Street Journal editorial the first
couple of years you know or reporting
first you know throughout the whole
Clinton years and at first they were a
little nervous because the add some of
this populist rhetoric but pretty soon
within a few months you start getting
you know editorials in the Wall Street
Journal and articles in fact not just
editorials about how Clinton is the best
president the business has ever had
they quote the Ford company executive is
saying we're getting along with it much
better than we did with Bush and Reagan
and on and on now of course you know
they'd prefer the Gingrich guys actually
with some ambiguity I should say because
they don't like the small business
aspect of the Gingrich people there's a
delicate balance there between holding
off the crazies and making sure that the
really rich people get everything so
there's been a problem but the as far as
Clinton was concerned they were
perfectly happy with him yeah he's a
moderate Republican so and I don't think
I don't think you can say that he's
deceived anyone you know if you look at
his positions all the way along they've
been very clear people didn't want to
see it that's their choice but it's been
clear it's been clear to the business
press it's been clear his policies
exactly what kind of education program
would be crafted out of that I'd be very
suspicious about it
and I think it's worth a very careful
look I mean there's plenty of problems
with the educational system but the main
problem is that the way too few
resources go into it now it's not that
we don't have money you know like
there's no budget crisis or anything
like that the country's just flooded
with money again
read the business press you know it
cannot find adjectives exuberant enough
to describe you know the dazzling
stupendous profit growth and you know
what are we going to do with all those
funds and so on the country's just
flooded with money capital but all
getting very narrowly concentrated okay
there's plenty of money around to
improve the educational system and we
know exactly where has to come from but
I I think that's its main problem I mean
teachers are way underpaid you know
they're under educated they're not given
enough respect too many kids in school
in a classroom you know not enough
educational materials and so on and so
forth not there's no special you know
nobody has any brilliant ideas about at
least I've never heard anything about
how people should be educated except you
know kids natural and enthusiasm and
creativity ought to be allowed to you
know aren't work in constructive way on
all this kind of stuff you know what
what's missing is the resources fine so
let's provide the resources so maybe
they won't have
dazzling stupendous profits next year
and instead kids will get a better
education I think that's what I have but
what I'm worried about is it's going
that the system is moving towards the
kind of privatization which just imposes
costs on the public remember all this
privatization you hear about it's
supposed to be very efficient and by
some measure you know by some ludicrous
measure it probably is efficient you
know and there part of the reason why
it's efficient is you don't count the
costs okay so like if you suppose
they're talking about privatizing the
MTA around you know the public
transportation thing all right suppose
you privatize the system you and I know
how to make it more efficient by the
economists measures you throw out union
workers and you get temps for half the
price and if there is an accident
because they never had any training well
it's just people are getting killed you
don't measure that and you cut off the
so-called unprofitable bus routes okay
or subway routes like you don't make a
lot of money at 11 p.m. okay so let's
throw them out well suppose somebody
stuck somewhere at 11 p.m. and wants to
get home oh well you know it's
entrepreneurial values you know let them
hire a limousine or something you know
and in ways like that you can make the
system more efficient simply by
transferring the costs over the public
where you'll measure the costs okay so
you know it looks nice and efficient on
some some you know some economists paper
but of course you just this huge costs
transferred over the public which you
don't measure we all know this and
that's what privatizing of the
educational system will be also it's
doing something else it's it's going
after exactly that moral conception that
underlies the labor movement from its
origins namely we're in it together you
know it's not just gain wealth
forgetting all but self like I we should
care not only that my kid can go to
school but the kid down the street can
go to school that's what's being driven
out of people's heads you know there's a
very powerful effort to drive any of
that out of people's heads
you're only supposed to care about
yourself unless you're rich of course if
you're rich you're part of big socialist
structures called corporations with
strategic alliances and play as support
from the state and then you're allowed
to have all these feelings about yeah we
work together for us the rich guys but
everybody else is supposed to be on
their own you know you're not supposed
to care whether the kid down the street
goes to school it's like breaking it's I
mean it should be very familiar to
people in the labor movement this is the
main propaganda against the labor
movement all the time I mean
right-to-work laws everything else you
shouldn't work together that's bad if
you work together you might do something
that matters okay so just be out on your
own you know and if you can get a
voucher so maybe your kid you go to
school forget about everything else I
look this this is a very much a business
run society you know I mean about the
last figures I saw about one out of six
dollars and the whole economy is spent
on marketing it's extremely inefficient
use of funds of course marketing them
produce anything any public goods but
marketing is a form of manipulation and
deceit it's it's an effort to create
artificial wants you know to put people
to control the way people look and think
about things a lot of that marketing is
straight propaganda advertising
instantly most of it is tax free or a
lot of it as tax free which means the
way our system works you pay for the
privilege of being propagandized you
know of having all this stuff dumped on
you those are not small figures that's
like a trillion dollars a year in 1992
something on that order and yes these
when you're when you've got that much of
a commitment to controlling minds and
manipulating desires and so on and doing
all the things they talk about in the
public relations literature making it up
you can read it there and the social
science literature because this is also
standard academic thought to a well you
know when you've got those stakes you're
going to work on it hard and it's going
to be hard to fight against that's what
makes organizing tough it's not just you
know
well you know way better than me and I'm
not going to talk about it but you have
to break through a lot of psychic
resistance the whole history the labor
movement tells you that and as I say
this was well understood by mill hands
and Lowell
miner fifty years ago but yeah it's a
big battle and you're not just
struggling against somebody who calls it
a right to work act you're struggling
against five hours a day of television
and the movie industry and the books and
the schools and everything else the
scale of the efforts to win the battle
for men's minds is enormous I mean I
thought I knew something about this
stuff but when I read Elizabeth thumb's
Woolf book I was pretty shot just to see
the scale of the efforts and the
dedication you know the frenzied
dedication to winning this everlasting
battle it's really pretty impressive
although if you think of the stakes it's
not too surprising I was curious about
your remarks about the millions amol and
maybe the best idea was for
so okay let's just talk about the
principle okay I mean the principle as
far as I can see goes right back to the
Enlightenment you know like if you go
back to classical and lighten month
thought I'm now talking about Adam Smith
and you know Jefferson and those guys I
the sort of core idea is people have a
right to control their own work you know
okay that the that if a person here I'll
quote some a standard formula back in
the 18th century you know leading heroes
of the Enlightenment is if a person
works on if a person does beautiful work
under external command meaning for wages
we may admire what he does but we
despise what he is because not for human
being okay that goes all the way through
classical liberal thought and lighten
man thought I mean you know Alexis de
Tocqueville says under wage labor the
art advances the artisan declines now
you find this going right into the
working-class movements and Lowell and
Lawrence I think that's just natural I
wouldn't try to convince anybody of it
it seems to me if you think about it
yeah why should you work on command I
mean if you work on command you're some
kind of slave now why not work because
it's coming out of your needs and
interests I mean like cheap for me to
say I'm going to fancy University in a
science department and I can do that one
of the nice things about being in the
Sun in sciences of fencing university is
you really do have workers control I'm
to a very large extent we control what
we do you know want to work on this
topic I work on that topic I mean you
got to sell it to funders and this and
that but the degree of workers control
at the elite level is quite substantial
I mean that's why it's such a privilege
to be in a science department you know
enormous ly privileged existence forget
the money if they pay you one-tenth the
amount of money it would still be a much
better existence than working on command
now I think people do know that
you know I don't think that these
enlightenment ideas are hard to grasp I
think people know that if you work on
under external control you may despise
admire what the person does but despise
what he is because his labor you know
the sort of central part of your life is
being done at somebody else's orders and
you are not controlling the way it's
done or why it's done or how it's used
or anything else well you can't have
every individual controlling every
single thing but that's why you have
democratic structures because people
control things together you know okay I
I don't know how to I wouldn't try to
convince anybody this because I'd
frankly just don't believe that everyone
doesn't know it I think maybe I'm
sentimental but it seems to me if you
sort of cut away waves of you know
layers of distortion and delusion these
things that were considered pretty
obvious two hundred years ago or still
obvious what about the idea that the
Cold War serves certain ideological and
political purposes for the US and now
the u.s. is seeking a new paradigm
there's something true about the fact
that the Cold War paradigm was extremely
useful as a way of controlling people so
like they take the labor movement you
know one of the ways of controlling
undermining and destroying the labor
movement was weeding out the activist
elements on the principle that there are
somehow not loyal enough to the state at
this time of you know when the enemy is
at our throats well like any propaganda
even the most vulgar propaganda that
comes out at Stalinist Russia there's
always some thread of truth to it he
just couldn't have propaganda that
doesn't have some you know marginal
element of truth and there was some
marginal element of truth here too but
it wasn't very real it's like the Cuba
case you know so yes this has been a
very terrific hammer to use over
people's heads and it was understood I
should say if you haven't read it yet
you should read NSC 68 which was
everybody agrees was the fundamental
cold word document it's
kind of interesting that it's content
everybody recognizes it as the major
document but nobody quotes with very few
exceptions on one but I have a book
called deterring democracy which in the
first chapter has a lot of extensive
quotes from NSC 68 its April 1950 and it
sort of laid out the basic picture of
the Cold War and it's quite fascinating
to read for one thing because when you
can see why diplomatic historians don't
quote it this was written by the real
hotshots you know Dean Acheson Paul
netsy all these smart guys it reads like
a bunch of raving lunatics
you know I don't take my word for it
read it you know I mean I concede I
picked out the most dramatic examples
but read the whole thing if you feel
like it's not that long in my view it
sounds like a bunch of raving lunatics
which is why nobody ever cites it but
they do make some points I mean the
picture they tell is kind of a fairy
tale you know on one hand there's
absolute evil that's the other side it's
kind of like a fairy tale you'd be
embarrassed to read your grandchildren
there's this total absolute evil
you know the Kremlin this and that which
is planning to destroy the whole world
and everything that ever existed and so
on on the other side there's utter
perfection that's us
you know we're like super angels the
only thing we ever do is you work you
know slave for the benefit of this and
that and it's portrayed in the picture
of a you know as a an exaggerated fair
parody of a fairy tale there's never any
evidence given because it's just like a
matter of definition they say it's it's
a it's an it it's an essential nature of
the Kremlin that it acts this way so you
don't have to even give evidence because
it's just part of their nature and it's
essential property of our nature that we
do this sort of thing okay so there's no
evidence given in fact there is evidence
scattered around very carefully
scattered around so that anybody is
going to look for it's not hard time
finding it and when you find when you do
put together the evidence I did in the
same book you find that it completely
undermines whatever thesis they have
about relative power but forgetting that
then comes the proposals the proposals
are we're involved in a real war to real
war
you know of cold war we have to fight it
like a war to prevent this monstrous
thing from destroying everything and
allowing utter perfection and
magnificence to win and in a war you've
got to have things like just suppression
we have to have suppression of dissent
among us one of our weaknesses is that
we're too tolerant and to open and to
free they say that you know and that's a
weakness so we have to have just
suppression and control of dissent and
you know make sure that everybody is
obedient and so on and the way to do it
is through they also call for military
Keynesianism that means transferring
public funds to private industry which
was a big issue then because everybody
knew that the economic system is not
going to function without a tremendous
amount of public funding state funding
poured in so that was crucial and that's
true of the International economy too at
that time a very heavily reliant on
military spending to revitalize it the
and they know all that and it's laid out
but also that it would be an ideological
weapon it would be a weapon to control
people and that's true it was I mean
from then until the game started to go
away in 1989 round then I it was a
tremendous weapon of flood control
anything you wanted the block just yolk
or do you know yell cold war didn't
matter how crazy it was sometimes there
was some truth to it sometimes not so
yes you need a new paradigm okay because
how we going to beat people over the
head now that we don't have that around
anymore and if you look through the 80s
it was already obvious through the 1980s
that this stuff is going to lose its
efficacy you'd have to be a big genius
to figure out that the Soviet Union was
in trouble so you look at stuff say I
was writing since the early 80s have
been saying look they're going to have
to go to something else and in fact
right through the 80s there's almost
desperate search for something else you
know international terrorism or crazed
arabs or hispanic narco traffickers or
something or other that we have to
defend ourselves against or otherwise
how you going to control everybody okay
domestic crime mostly manufactured you
know US doesn't have crime levels very
different from other industrial
countries it doesn't in fact but a very
different perception of crime welfare
queens you know
sort of by implication black driving
around in Cadillacs and you know that
sort of thing so there's all sorts of
effort to you know manufacture enemies
for people to hate but a foreign enemy
is much better and so here's where the
science of government comes in now let's
to get back to this clash of
civilizations thing Huntington's you
know everybody is flailing around for
some paradigm you know some big thing
that you can use to control people and
Huntington's ideas clash of
civilizations so you know there's Islam
and us and all these other things and
the reason why the world is the idea is
the reason why the world is so
disorderly is because you've got all you
know with a cold war gone you've got all
these ethnic groups killing each other
and so on
well as usual it's always a good idea to
start by asking about the facts whenever
you hear anything said very confidently
the first thing that should come to mind
is wait a minute is that true you know
so is it true I mean is it true that
there's more ethnic conflict now than
there was 20 years ago well take a look
I in most of the big conflicts that are
going on around the world are we're
going on right through the Cold War like
Burundi and Rwanda now huge maskers
going on in the early 70s actually I
wrote about them at the time nobody was
talking about him because it wasn't
interesting but they were there there
are some the in fact or take say you
know in fact just about everyone you
pick goes way back now there are some
that are new those in within the former
Soviet system including Yugoslavia you
know within the old so-called communist
system yeah they're new
so like the war in Chechnya or you know
Azerbaijan Armenia
you know Tajikistan you know these
things are all new but that's standard
any time a tyrannical system breaks down
you have all sorts of conflict internal
to it just take a look at the breakdown
of the European empires every single one
was like that Muslim were worse so first
of all the very factual basis is very
thin now what about the principal clash
of civilizations like say the Big Bad
you
Islam whether a few problems with that
our the most fundamentalist Islamic
state in the world is our big Ally Saudi
Arabia how's that fit you know I mean
Saudi Arabia's are real it's not
fundamentalist enough for some of the
people in it but it's pretty extreme are
we trying to undermine Saudi Arabia of
course not they're sitting on all the
oil you know in fact there are clients
that's a family to Tator ship we keep in
power because they make sure that the
money from oil doesn't go to the people
of the region that goes to London in New
York so they're okay there's no clash of
civilizations there that's state
fundamental what about individual you
know like nots non-state well by far the
worst ones are the guys are tearing
Afghanistan to pieces now you find crazy
more crazy Islamic fundamentalist around
the NEM I don't know about them where
they get their power from well your
pocket
you know they got six billion dollars or
so it's claimed from the United States
and Saudi Arabia and through the 1980s
now they're tearing Afghanistan apart
but it's not our you know nothing like
we did you know we're only wonderful
people so how where is this clash of
civilizations between Islam in the West
I don't see it I mean Indonesia is a
Islamic state do you see us trying to
undermine Indonesia I mean in a lot of
rotten things in Indonesia like for
example wages are about half the level
of China which is not so munificent do
you see us doing anything about that I
mean I I think this is all for us you
know I mean I don't mean to say total
for us like there must be a new paradigm
you know something that people can build
their careers on and write books about
and so on and so forth which can then be
turned into a device of controlling
people that part is true and maybe this
will work or if it doesn't you try
something else
you
