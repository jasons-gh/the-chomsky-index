well let's take a look at the war on
drugs right I mean it's been declared
probably 20 times in the last 20 years
or so every couple years it's declared
its declared against a background of
understanding for example it was studied
years ago by the RAND Corporation the
main government advisory corporation and
the Army in which they investigated just
straight cost-benefit analysis of
various ways of treating the drug
problem drug problems here it's not in
Columbia so they said well you know
which ways of dealing with the problem
here are cost-effective and they found
which will surprise no one who's paid
attention to the history that the most
cost-effective way of doing it is
prevention and treatment okay in fact if
you think about it that's the way one of
the worst drug problems has been handled
I mean there is a drug which is much
worse than cocaine it's called tobacco
it kills far more people then cocaine
does and it was handled pretty well by a
cultural change so if you look through
the 1980s it's a class issue so people
with education and you know degree of
privilege simply adopted a more healthy
lifestyle they stopped smoking they
stopped eating red meat they didn't
drink as much coffee and so on there
were no police you know that nobody
carry out chemical warfare in North
Carolina and Kentucky to destroy tobacco
fields this it was simply an educational
process a kind of cultural change that
led to a significant decline of the use
of by far the most dangerous drug among
people who were a part of that cultural
change that took place thanks to their
privilege okay now that's exactly what
the rand on the army a study years ago
they were of course discussing tobacco
but that's exactly what they concluded
about hard drugs and
marijuana they said the best the
cheapest and most effective way of
dealing with it is prevention and
treatment well there another way use of
police okay that's much less effective
and much more costly there's a third way
interdiction at the borders that's still
more expensive by quite a large margin
and far less and far more costly and the
worst way of all way more costly than
anything else and totally ineffective is
what we call fumigation but would in
fact is chemical warfare I've been down
to southern Colombia and seen some of it
its chemical warfare which is driving
huge numbers of peasants off their land
destroying the crops Colombia has the
second biggest refugee problem the world
after Sudan and they're driven at the
urban slums and multinational
corporations come in and start mining
and so on and so forth that's the least
effective and the most costly and you
know the fact that we do it again if you
can kind of abstract yourself and
pretend you're a Martian looking at this
it's just kind of unimaginable I mean
the number of people in Colombia killed
by us tobacco is way beyond the number
of Americans killed by colombian cocaine
need to go to a country like China is
astronomically more okay do they have a
right to come to the United States and
carry out chemical warfare and North
Carolina and Kentucky because they have
a tobacco problem and it's coming from
here I mean you can't even speak the
words it's so outlandish but we do it
means just fine you know even though
it's known to be the least effective the
most costly and totally immoral as we
see right away if we think the situation
reversed well that's been going on for
decades that's the war on drugs the use
it has affected the use of drugs here at
all in fact let's take a look at the
cost of drugs and availability barely
changed well you know when people carry
out a so-called war for years and years
when they know what the consequences are
going to be and they have plenty
evidence that that's exactly what the
consequences are it has no effect on
drugs a rational person will begin to
ask themselves is this a war on drugs
okay I mean are they totally insane is
it a war on drugs or is it a war to in
Colombia for example a part of a wharf
counterinsurgency to clear peasants off
the land so that the multinational
corporate mining corporations and
agribusiness can come in and so on and
in the United States is it a war on
drugs or is it an effort to get rid of
what are called the dangerous classes
people if you look at the history of
prohibition this could work in legal
history on history of provision it's
very typically aimed at what are called
the dangerous classes people who are
kind of getting in our hair so what we
call prohibition you know banning of
alcohol wasn't aimed that wealthy people
in Westchester County New York and so on
they get to whatever they liked but it
was aimed that working-class people and
immigrants and you know the bars in
downtown Manhattan marijuana if you look
at the prohibition of marijuana it was
not on medical grounds was because was
used by Mexicans and then was used in
the 1920s by blacks and Harlem
Renaissance and then of course and then
I think 30 is the Bureau of Narcotics
had a big problem prohibition came in
and had this huge apparatus and where
they going to do with it as they had to
find something so okay figured we'll go
after marijuana but the drug of the
dangerous classes and if you look at the
whole science goes back to the 19th
century in 19th century England gen was
prohibited but whiskey wasn't well just
take a look at who was drinking them and
that runs right through history these
are wars to control the dangerous
classes in fact the explosion of the war
on drugs here was in the 1980s and since
and during that period us incarceration
programs just flew off the spectrum I
mean back around nineteen eighty the US
was slightly at the high end of
industrial societies and per capita
incarceration but within the spectrum
and now it's five to ten times as high
as comparable countries not because
there's more crime that crimes remain
kind of steady and it's still relatively
countries who it was and if you take a
look at who's in jail yeah defeat the
useless people black males the people
who we can't incorporate than our
society this is the residue of slavery
of course there are different genes so
yeah they're the ones we get rid of in
Latin America that a name for it it's
called social cleansing the dangerous
classes you send out the death squads
and you know kill them we've might of
the bridge we're more humane here so you
put them in jail forever and the pretty
imprisonment the it's not just a level
of incarceration but the savagery of it
is just unknown in comparable countries
like I'm the senior national did a study
a couple of years ago of children in
prison without chance of parole so
permanently permanent to imprisonment I
don't remember the exact numbers but
they do then deal with countries that
don't have statistics you know like
Sudan but in the countries where you
know something about what's going on I
think they found something like maybe
2,500 cases and about 2400 were in the
United States I mean this includes cases
of you know 12 year old kid who happened
to be in a room where a felony murder
was carried out okay in jail for life I
match I've seen cases like this in
prison which I say one case just I don't
know how prevalent it is but during the
Civil Rights years I was down in Jackson
Mississippi for demonstration and I was
with Howard Zinn a couple other people
from up here and we designated ourselves
proper self-congratulation as the New
England professors delegation so we were
escorted through the prison by the
police chief and that's where
and in the prisons Jackson Mississippi
prison which is not bad by usual
standards I've been locked up myself in
worst prisons but as we what we're
walking down the halls we passed my
these huge cages you know people in the
cages and they're all black black men
but as we walk past a child tacked on
the bars and asked how many standing or
he asked me if I could get him a drink
of water so I turned to the police chief
Lynn I said can I get him a drink of
water there's the fountain down the hall
so he said sure so he came over and gave
him a drink of water well when we got
back to the office to talk to the chief
I we asked him what's that kid doing in
there so he asked some clerk to look it
up and it turned out that they just
found him in the streets and they didn't
know what to do with him I said they put
him in jail and he'll stay there for the
rest of his life now cases like that are
not counted you know but they it is part
of the savagery of imprisonment of the
dangerous classes and most of you know
very high percentage of people in prison
are drug-related offenses they find a
kid in Roxbury with a joint in his
pocket it happens three times okay days
in jail for knows how many years has
nothing to do with reducing drugs you
can see that from the statistics but it
does have something to do with purifying
the society of the people who we find
threatening the dangerous classes
usually people were crushing in one form
or another I don't see any other
rational interpretation of the so-called
war on drugs thank you
