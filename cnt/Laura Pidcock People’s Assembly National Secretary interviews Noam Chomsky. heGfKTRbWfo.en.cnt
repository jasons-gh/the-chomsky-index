Oh
okay noam chomsky thank you so much for
joining us and I just want to start by
asking how are you and how's everything
where you are yeah everything's okay and
you're on yeah good and honestly we are
just so so grateful that you are at
giving this interview to the People's
Assembly and and I think it's fair to
say that you're a legend you've
contributed so much to our collective
knowledge and understanding of the world
and for that we thank you and I want to
start off by asking you what what
brought you to have a thirst for more
knowledge and particularly for political
activism
it's almost 90 years ago people coming
to the door trying to sell rags starving
seeing women picketing outside a textile
plant and being beaten by security
forces and it's the early 30s you
couldn't help becoming politically
engaged my whole family was
working-class immigrants mostly
unemployed it was just everywhere around
you never never stopped and it obviously
really shaped your consciousness and I
just I just I suppose we can't not start
by thinking about coronavirus and and
the pandemic and its relationship to
capitalism do you think this could be
this moment in time could be the
catalyst for fundamental change it could
be but we have to start by recognizing
exactly what you said what is the
relation of the pandemic to capitalism
I don't read all the British press but
it's never discussed here if I the word
about it but if we want to stop if we
want to understand what happened
that's the question we have to ask that
furthermore is a very practical question
because there's another pandemic very
likely coming probably more severe than
this one because of the effects of
global warming and the scientists are
telling us exactly what they told us in
2003 after the SARS epidemic that we
have to prepare right now but what and
they know what to do basically pretty
much but somebody has to do it who can
do it well one possibility is drug
companies but they are loaded with
profits thanks to the neoliberal
globalization that they've designed
which gives them extraordinary patent
rights monopolies what that pricing
grain so they got money coming out of
their ears they have all these labs and
so on but there's a barrier exactly what
you said capitalism it's not profitable
to prepare for the disaster a couple of
years down the road that's not the way
you make money so they're out well
there's another possibility the
government the government doesn't it
does most of the research public funds
are used for most of the research that
creates vaccines and drugs the basic
research and development is done in
government labs and research
institutions research universities and
it over to the drug companies for
adaptation to the market and profits
that's what we call a free morning if I
saw the government has the resources and
the capacities to do it but then there's
another barrier that's called Reagan and
Thatcher neoliberalism the government is
the problem not the solution Reagan's
little speech when he was inaugurated
Thatcher echoed it in her own words that
inaugurates the 40 years of
neoliberalism
intensified in England by austerity and
the continent disaster for most of the
population great for the tiny sectors
that enrich themselves but what it
really means is when you say government
is the problem
that means decisions and choices of
action have to be taken away from the
government which is at least to some
extent responsive to the population and
has to be placed in the hands of
completely unaccountable private
tyrannies that's what it means
so okay given the savage form of
capitalism cold neoliberalism the
government is out so that's to mean
these are the two main ways of dealing
with the problem both board then after
that comes the reactions of particular
governments and leaders and that has
very so for example when when the
pandemic struck December it were China
began reporting unexplained pneumonia
like symptoms distributed by the World
Health Organization but were there about
ten days at China Chinese scientists
said identified the virus source that
sequence the genome had provided the
information to the World Health
Organization in the entire world at that
point comes the question how governments
respond well there are governments who
care enough about their population so
they responded right away South Korea
Taiwan Singapore New Zealand Australia
they have the situation pretty much in
hand others waited Europe didn't pay
much attention at first to these agents
finally they got started in various ways
Europe more or less
in different ways reacting some of them
pretty successfully Britain was the
wreck you know what happened don't tell
you that the absolute bottom of the
barrel was the United States it was
impossible for health officials
intelligence to break through they get
to the White House to get the sociopath
in charge to pay attention now he's
blaming everybody in sight
this morning he blamed his intelligence
briefer he said she didn't tell him of
course she pulled the trunk let's blame
China let's blame the World Health
Organization find somebody to cover up
for the crimes but he's responsible for
killing tens of thousands of Americans
can't let that be on the record other
governments reacted differently it's I
should say that if you look back a
couple of years the things were
happening in the years before the
pandemic struck so the Obama
administration actually did make some
efforts to try to deal with things the
Obama administration was a science
oriented administration a lot of
scientists who constantly consulted and
they they actually developed a pretty
extensive system for reacting that
quickly if event if a pandemic stroke
which was anticipated the first thing
Trump did when he came to office within
days literally was dismantle the entire
system better get rid of not doesn't be
a profit to my friends you don't want
well then he started there were programs
you government programs with US
scientists working to try to identify
other coronaviruses they worked in China
which is one of the main sources with
Chinese scientists these were disbanded
he began to defund the Center for
Disease Control
very similar to what's been happening in
England with trying to turn the best
health service in the world into a model
of the worst health service in the world
that's England the United States same
thing the every year of his
administration he defunded the Center
for Disease Control other health-related
institution to mean well handing out
lavish gifts to his rich supporters tax
cut is just a main legislative
achievement just a giveaway to the
corporate sector and the rich actually
that's happening right now with the
bailout when you look at it in any event
the United say also that under
neoliberal programs the health system
which is already an international
scandal pretty much the only country
without any kind of national health care
but it was the neoliberal the
requirement is that you impose a
business model that means no extra beds
in hospital just just on time just like
you run an auto plan now which more or
less works in normal times not wonderful
is many can attest including me but at
least it sort of works anything goes
wrong it collapses if the assembly line
collapses on a motor plan okay you wait
a while and you fix it but you can't fix
this and it's gone so everything
collapsed you see these heroic doctors
and nurses working overtime and in
hospitals without equipment without
protection nothing's there because there
was no spirit capacity and a sociopath
running the place is one thing one day
one thing the next day and in fact is
acting to make it worse very clearly
could go into then but anyway that's
that's what happens when you had a real
a significant business model imposed
then it's a recipe for disaster
this was exaggerated during the
neoliberal period now she goes back
before so that's where we are now the
the current we will one or one way or
another recovered from the pandemic
it'll be a terrible cost much greater
cost than it has to be there will be
recovered then comes the question of
what kind of world comes out of it well
there are groups working very hard
relentlessly to ensure that what comes
out of it is a replica of what caused it
under a harsher or authoritarian regime
so if you take a look at the president
Trump's executives workers it worth
reading take a look at the small print
that's not very deeply didn't like
calling for deregulating everything it
makes it look as if it's just because of
the crisis you read closely it's not it
says is the graph to use the opportunity
to make the deregulation permanent to
get rid of any constraints on the
business world by the by governmental
authority to ensure that businesses have
no liability so a business forces its
workers back to work say in a
meatpacking plant where it's very
dangerous
mostly Porto Rican and black and who
cares if they get a virus because if
there's not health conditions
established they don't have any
liability that's very important it's one
of the main issues behind the holding up
the stimulus bills then all of this is
to be a permanent goes on the fuel the
fossil fuel companies are there begging
for increases in subsidies toll granted
now this is a way to design
and meanwhile the surveillance that's
being introduced is pretty interesting
to look at so people are working at home
whether the bosses don't like that they
can't watch them every minute so they're
in there's new software being developed
which enables the boss to monitor your
computer screen and check your keyboard
so if you go off into the kitchen and
get a cup of coffee they know and you
quickly get a demerit not to go it'll
maintain tight control over the work
force they're our slaves they don't have
any freedom and if they're working at
home we have to extend it to home
because there's nothing particularly new
about this it's just the enhancement of
what's been going on throughout the
Industrial Revolution like The Killers
no but this is extending and this
technology can be permanent it can be
ways in which your home is under
surveillance surveillance means control
well that's been going on anyway if
you're working in an Amazon warehouse
for example you're tightly monitored
there's a designated paths that you have
to go when you're racing from one spot
to another if you get off the path path
you get a warning an instant warning
demerits you're in trouble
suppose you're driving a delivery truck
for United Parcel Service they've worked
out electronics which means they can
monitor everything the drivers doing if
the drivers say stops for a cup of
coffee
demerit if he backs up when he wasn't
supposed to back up the mirror and you
see I don't I don't know if you see the
delivery drivers where you are but I see
them from my window and they look
intensely stressed and pressurized and
it is a theme of the modern way of work
there so atomized and their their rights
their relationship to them
is is so broken I want I want to because
you've just described their so
eloquently how the capitalist system
intensifies and exacerbates this this
coronavirus and what comes next is
really up to two forces and the forces
of those that you describe want to
replicate what has already been and all
of those millions upon millions of
people who are desperate for change and
and you quite rightly said we don't ever
really in the mainstream talk about the
virus within the context of capitalism
we have government daily briefings I
don't know if you've seen them but
they're very stage-managed they are very
very tight they are very often
alternative realities to people's daily
existence and answer in one sense this
whole scenario is left in the lid on and
exposing the kind of the ravages of
capitalism if you like and I wonder if
there will be a connection by many many
more people between their experience and
the system that depends on people like
you it's a little bit like knowing how
to deal with a crisis but nobody picking
up the ball and running with it
yes we now have very clear evidence
about the catastrophic features of
capitalism particularly in the
unregulated reagan-thatcher form their
style from new labor form austerity form
you know this is what it leads to the
informations there it's not profound
it's right on the surface as soon as you
look at it but somebody has to use the
information
somebody has to reach the public with
what you're not seeing in the headlines
I doubt that there are many headlines
saying this is the capitalist crisis
here's the reason well okay it's a job
of vacuum is to do it reach the public
with I mean you can't expect people who
are trying to get body to the next
paycheck that it worked all of this
element but activists can do it and I
think it's a time when there could be
major challenges to a system of
oppression which is very deep-seated all
the way back to the nature of capitalism
has gotten much worse during the
neoliberal austerity period it's it
leaves people angry resentful and bitter
hating institutions it's fertile
territory for demagogues we've seen then
you can blame somebody else
you know the immigrants the Chinese
somebody out there and not the people
who are responsible we don't blame them
some of the institutions that are
responsible but that's the job and it's
interesting that you talk about the
blame game knowing because right now you
probably know this but the British
Parliament is passing an immigration
bill in the middle of this crisis I mean
the the bill was in the pipeline but in
the middle of the crisis that has
re-emerged conversations about who
should get access to the NHS that the
diversion in my view can I just quote
something you've said before and and ask
you a bit a bit more about it you said
it is rather striking to observe that
the policies that the rich and powerful
adopt for themselves are precisely the
opposite of those they dictate for the
weak and per I just want to know what
you think the most striking example of
that is that you have observed in the
system take a look at the United States
today 0.1 not 10.1 percent of the
population have about
20% of the country's wealth the half the
population has negative net worth
liabilities greater than assets an
estimated roughly 70% of the population
are living from paycheck to paycheck
that's if they're lucky enough to have a
job there's been a vast increase in the
what's called sometimes the precariat
with precarious employment you're
sitting there waiting on the phone your
boss says you got to come in tonight and
work for late hours maybe go the benefit
system has which was pretty awful in the
first place one of the worst in the OECD
severely declined the efforts no or to
make it worse that meanwhile other
people are doing great so during the
pandemic private equity firms and hedge
funds have seen their profits soar
though their private equity firms are
using the pandemic to buy up the medical
facilities would you chief no and
particularly the ones that are
non-essential so they're going after
dermatology you know Botox treatments or
wrinkles on your face and so on and the
buying up the paying off the doctors
some agree you become employees and then
pressing for special rights to use those
no so let's get people to come in for
you know getting their wrinkles fixed
and so on I mean well breaking all the
rules and there's the profits are going
through the roof but there's another one
that's not talked about much but you
both in England in the United States
nursing homes have been one of the worst
that most suffering of all I know the
u.s. situation bidders will describe
that I'm sure it's emitting the most of
been bought up by private institutions
the wealthy funds equity funds and so on
and they're being treated like any
business that you're trying to destroy
cut it down to the limit you know no no
equipment no nursing's and so on
meanwhile profits is doing great they
are the Association of nursing home
owners very wealthy one of trumps main
funders so he appears with them in
public events where he praises them for
their wonderful things they're doing or
more money who was both very well people
are dying okay they're dispensable who
needs them it's kind of just like
yesterday a czar the head of the Health
System it was asked in a press
conference but of why the death rate in
the United States is so high is it a is
it a problem that the government didn't
do something properly he said no the
problem is he said we have an unhealthy
Society blacks and Hispanics are
unhealthy there are cities there too
obese thing we can't do anything about
that the government can't help the fact
that we have this unhealthy segment of
the society the people aren't pure white
okay that's from the top executive okay
what do you think that effect that has
on people ever listening people out in
the rural areas who say you know we
don't want these people anyway their
infection not sure that's how true
builds up his voting base understand the
Republicans have a serious problem
they've had it ever since Reagan back to
Nixon there of the to the United States
basically a one-party state as a
business party two factions one faction
is more committed to the rich the
powerful the corporate sector than the
other one is
become much more so in recent years well
you can't go to voters and say I'm
trying to screw you please vote for me
so what you have to do is turn the
vertical cultural issues that said gun
rights abortion the foreigners and likes
something really so you have to create a
voting base on the basis of these kinds
of issues now when you have a basically
a sociopathic racist and charged with
his words being echoed on the Murdoch
Network Fox News Network which most
Republicans listen to as an impact now
that's why you have attitudes which are
driving the United States off the
international spectrum and the pandemic
is bad enough but there's things that
are worse that a will we will recover
from the pandemic we're not going to
recover from the melting of the polar
ice sheets the increasing heating which
is going to make much of the world
uninhabitable in 50 or 60 years and
recover from that well you can't do
anything about that unless people know
it's happening you take a look at
Republicans majorities don't see any
problem they hear from the president
from the party leaders from Fox News so
the liberal hoax
I don't see that you know I don't see it
happening so it's not happen if that
continues were basically finished there
isn't a lot of time to deal with this
and I think you saw and you you know
you'd have known in December we had a
general election I was one of the
victims of that general election I lost
my parliamentary seat but irrespective
of irrespective of that there was lots
of cultural issues that were stoked up
so it was a kind of brexit election but
very often it was about power you know
the Conservative Party talked about
power and control and about bringing
back power to two people but had none of
the policies to actually liberate anyone
you know and conversely there were very
very progressive industrial relations
policies developed by what was the
opposition party the Labour Party at the
time around workers having the capacity
to negotiate their own terms and
conditions and a whole raft of other
things of course didn't chime I suppose
or was not as powerful as some of the
the kind of tactics of division and the
imagery of taken back control although
we now know that were moving into a
period where people are ultimately
completely out of control in this in
this crisis their exposure to the virus
it's completely dependent on the state
on their employment relationship and and
what kind of what kind of money that
they have no I just I just want to move
as on because we are a grassroots
organization and people were kind of
blown away that we were going to be
talking to you so they sent in questions
I'm just going to put a couple of those
questions now if that's okay from the
people there are a part of and are
activists with the People's Assembly so
one person asked why do you think
socialism remains on the fringes of
politics at a time when capitalism is
failing people so regularly well the one
reason is that people are basically
unrepresented if you look at people's
attitudes but they tend to be pretty
progressive so take say what happened in
2017 in England the Labour Party with a
pretty progressive program what an
extraordinary victory well if you take a
look at say you go polls
people that pretty much the same
attitudes in 2019 the attitudes are
there not the willingness to vote for
the people for the party that were
supporting them well there's a gap there
I'm not going to talk about England you
know much more than I do but take the
United States the santer's program which
is basically the counterpart it's called
socialist it's considered radical but
just take a close look at what's
happening you read the mainstream press
which has kind of lift liberal columnist
some good ones they'll tell you they
right we liked Sanders as programs but
the country's just not ready for it it's
too radical for the country then ask
yourself what are the programs well two
major programs one is universal health
care have you heard of a country that
has universal health care I mean can you
think of one that doesn't have it it's
pretty hard but the rebbe American
people are not ready for that the other
is free higher education well take a
look at the continent almost every
country is free higher education and I
take a look at poor countries like
Mexico next door
cRIO average occasional so what these
colonists are saying the left column is
about the United States is this country
so backwards it can't join the world
well that's
attitude you know but it's if you ask
take a look at what people really want
they say yeah you do want this let's
have it not but if you not represent it
you're not gonna get it now there are
careful studies in the United States by
mainstream political scientists just
comparing people's attitudes and
preferences with the votes of their own
representatives and it's very
straightforward we see the votes got
plenty of coaling data on the attitudes
for about 70% of the population and
there's no correlation
they're totally unresentful o'er 70% on
the income level then you move up you
get a better correlation get to the top
fraction of 1% they're basically setting
policy a perfect correlation
well people may not read political
science journals but they know this they
see it in front right in front of their
eyes
but then comes the role of activists the
demagogues are going to come in and say
yeah this is because of the blacks in
the Porto Ricans and immigrants you know
and so on it's the job of activists to
come something no it's not that it's the
job of the capitalist institutions made
more savage and brutal by Thatcher
Reagan style neoliberalism you can get
that across then I think this gap you're
describing will be overcome
amazing job you're running up against a
ton of propaganda
it takes a England I don't have to tell
you it's bringing coals to Newcastle you
know much more than I do but you know
about the intense campaign of the media
the parliamentary Labour Party do
anything just destroying the effort to
build a participatory party in which
people will be under control of it it's
pretty clear that the Blair a
parliamentary sec they reported was
much prefer to lose the election than to
lose the party
and we see the same thing in the United
States the Democratic National Committee
would prefer to lose the election than
to lose the party to the young
progressives wing which is it's nothing
to join you know the coming in Georgia
and of course the media is media the
same I mean that leads me to because I
kind of felt like there's thousands of
us who lift that experience of seeing
Jeremy Corbyn I mean the People's
Assembly is across the left spectrum
it's not affiliated to one political
party but there was hope in Jeremy
Corbyn from lots of sections of the left
and that opportunity has now gone to
have the one of the most progressive
prime ministers that we have ever seen
in the United Kingdom that has gone and
lots of people are asking this question
it was one that was sent in should we
spend any more time chasing a
parliamentary route socialism in your
view well the traditional view of the
left which i think is valid is that what
matters is constant activism not just
when an election comes up but all the
time no every once in a while an event
comes along cold and lecture that should
lead to a few minutes thought doesn't
matter which one wins if it doesn't do
something else if it does take off a few
minutes push a lever go back to work no
in England one of the things you can do
in your activism is create an authentic
popularly supported participatory party
that was being done under Corbin it was
killed off by then
right after I ear section so that's part
of activism another part is just the
constant pressure on whoever's in
vultures to get them to do things so I
think it's not a choice either
parliamentary politics or activism it's
both balance depending on the nature of
the circumstances and on on the people's
assembly because we are a grass roots
movement combined in large sections of
the left born of anti-austerity politics
essentially and we want to grow even
more people into our movement and pull
people in who have until now being
politically apathetic I want to know
what in your view pulls people into the
struggle into resistance in an
anti-capitalist ink and what makes that
flip for people there are in the United
States but half the population doesn't
vote there have been some studies of the
socio-economic character of non voters
in the United States turns out to be
very similar to the socio-economic
profile of people in Europe who vote for
one of the labor rights or social
democratic parties in the United States
they don't see anybody to vote for so
they stay home if there's a party that
actually represents people in which they
participate not just some bureaucrat up
there says here's the program you can
push the button but in which they
participate locally local activities
things that are required in this
community and build up from there become
a party than people otherwise why should
they what what about getting that
because it's become a bit of a like an
obsession of a few of us who know that
there are many working-class people
who are in those deep experiences of
poverty and uncertainty and like Boris
Johnson for example and what watch what
I suppose a fundamental question is what
changes a person's mind to pull them
into that resistance and honey
capitalist thinking that you're a dog so
take my childhood early 30s was very
similar very deep depression things were
much worse than of the labor movement in
the United States had been crushed in
the nineteen twenties was destroyed by
the early Depression in 1929 about five
years
much too long but the Union started
rebuilding CIO began to organize
political parties began to emerge from
the left a lot of activism as pretty
soon militant labor actions were taking
place by 1935 1936 though they had
reached the level of sit-down strikes no
sit-down strike is a very frightening to
the young to the bosses because that
means we are one minute away from the
people in the workforce saying we don't
need you get lost
we'll take over to put the enterprise
and run it ourselves that's in fact they
can do better than managers so at that
point I started kidding saying a
willingness on the part of the ownership
class to make some adjustments there was
a sympathetic administration by then
made a big difference
then it was possible to move towards
basically we'll finish up stop it
welfare state social democracy okay the
New Deal which made a huge difference
that can happen again
but it started on the ground organizing
activism militant actions when they were
necessary educational groups the labor
unions used to be the cultural
educational organizations you went my as
I said full we started my family was
extended family was mostly
first-generation working clothes but for
them the unions were their lives now
that's where they went for educational
activities cultural activities concert
party even the weekend was given by the
Union so they couldn't did enough jobs
but they had a life rich life which made
them able to participate in the society
help create the new society now that's
what has to be done that has to be done
on the ground everywhere locally
starting and you know maybe starting
with electing a school board and honor
there from anything has to be done up to
the national effect I should say
international level this has to be done
internationally there's a reason why
every Union is called an international
maybe they're not living up to that but
there's a reason behind it this is an
international effort sometimes it's
realized select win longshoreman and
California refuse to Lordships going to
Fort Hood South Africa
that's internationalism then I can go
will beyond that and it must then in
fact right now there's a interesting
framework being developed which might
carry it forward about a week ago it was
the first announcement of the
Progressive International that's
initiated by Sanders in the United
States
Yanis for focus and you're 25 they're
having their first official conference
in September in Iceland where the Prime
Minister is one of the leading figures
in it that's an effort to create a true
international aimed at reversing
overcoming the neoliberal assault and
moving on from there to a much more
participatory free democratic just world
many ways to do that the bringing in the
global self as representatives from
India Africa and elsewhere this is an
effort to counter a reactionary
international which is being forged in
Washington the one to a strategic plan
that you can see emerging from the chaos
of the Trump administration is exactly
this to create an international action
Aryan states in the world guided by the
White House including Egypt the Gulf
dictatorships Israel way to the
international well the Progressive
International counter now if you look at
the level of states it looks totally
unequal look at the level of people's
it's quite a different story
that's weird people like you come in
that can tip the balance and which of
these forces prevails will determine
what kind of world comes own if only
people could kind of realize ever
stark choice but be that power that they
have that they can determine the future
sustainability of the planet the wages
of their loved ones the security of
their homes of the street every species
on the planet that will have a future
and I suppose and it's about how do we
communicate that people have that power
to the broadest and the broadest
possible amount of people to join in the
in the struggle and in and in the fight
and I want to I want to end on this
really know is that you have been
campaigning and writing and thinking and
being an activist for a long time now
and I'd like to know I want to know
first the name of your dog what's your
dog's name
2:09 but I also want to know em what
inspires you to be hopeful what what has
kept you determined all of this time
what hope is there for people truth is
it's people like you people who are on
the front lines don't give up keep
working there's reverses
there's progress you move forward over
if you look over a long stretch there's
a good deal of progress in our societies
are much more civilized than they were
not very long ago and it takes a England
wasn't that long ago when England
murdered the war hero the one of the
great mathematicians in the 20th century
because he was a homosexual
effect just it was just a year or two
ago that he finally got a royal pardon
well that's one of many signs of things
that have changed the law and take a
look at the United States in the 1960s
at the United State
had racist laws that were so extreme
that the Nazis refused to accept them as
a model literally and a miscegenation
laws of one drop of blood you know it's
not perfect now I just quoted a zone
that's a lot different from then now you
go back to the 1960s British common law
still held in the United States
according to British common law
Blackstone women aren't people they are
property property of the father handed
over to the husband wasn't until 1975
that the Supreme Court overruled that
but none of the echoes on none of these
things were gifts from both they came
from constant hard often bitter
dangerous struggle and it's made changes
okay and they're playing young people
doing it now but take again the United
so we face 90 there's two major issues
we face one of them isn't even talked
about nuclear war shocking that people
are talking about so today for example
today Trump dismantle does he one of the
last the arms control agreements the
Open Skies treaty goes back to
Eisenhower does he how far right the
political classes moved that dismantled
over the last one came if I might mean
one is climate change
it's inexorable it's going to be a
disaster
and we have maybe a decade or two to
deal with it if we don't we're toast and
it's changing not say some form of green
new deal is essential for survival a
couple of years ago it was even not
mentioned ridiculed but now it's on the
center of the legislative agenda in
Congress
why group of young people said a sunrise
movement for a part of the much broader
environmental movement very broad mostly
young people extinction rebellion and
others this group that was very active
as they got to the point of taking over
congressional offices now they were then
supported by some of the young
congressional representatives who were
swept in on the Sanders wave especially
Aleksandra Hook a sea of cortez
picked up a senator from massachusetts
ed markey now on the center of the
legislative agenda you can do something
with it if you take a look at the
Democratic program
Biden's program it's farther to the left
than any Democratic program since
roseville not because Biden and the
Democratic National Committee had a
conversion but because of the constant
pounding on the door of people mostly
young people people like you people like
the sunrise movement who made them do it
that can continue well that's a good
enough reason for who I very much agree
with you and I don't think any of us
would go out there and take part in
demonstrations put ourselves up for
elected office
join in people assembly local meetings
if we didn't believe in the potential
for change and every single thing that
you have listed there as you quite
rightly said came from human struggle
from collectivization and I think if
anything this virus has connected our
countries and I don't just mean in the
USA in the United Kingdom I mean
connected all of our countries in that
in that common struggle of knowing that
other other countries are dealing with
intense physical and political crises
and failure in political leadership and
hopefully and and you mentioned one
there
new bonds will be forged out of this
crisis that will allow us to transform
the economic system and and cultural
norms essentially about what we will
injure on this planet what we will
injure in our lives and I just want to
say a huge thank you to you know I you
know you the things that you have
contributed is is overwhelming and I
suppose just wanted to give you one last
opportunity to say anything without the
confines of the questions I put anything
at all that you just wish people would
realize or want people to know well I
think there's one good thing to keep in
mind I get a flood of letters from young
people who were just in despair we
haven't achieved everything anything
just meet in the back what can we do
mother you have to remember that you
basically have two choices you can
decide to be pessimistic hopeless
let the worst come you'll contribute to
that or you can recognize there are
opportunities there are people who have
grasped them under much harsher
conditions than we face and they have
moved things forward
so whatever the probability may be the
choices either sit back in a corner and
let the worst happen grab the
opportunities you can make it a better
world it's not much of a choice and on
that note I will say thank you so much
to you for everything and I have to say
you're just typing your name into
YouTube has made the lockdown experience
at times enjoyable you know you have so
much content out there I'd recommend
anyone that hasn't come across gnomes
work to just do that type his name into
YouTube and see the millions upon
millions of views for his lectures his
interviews his contributions
thanks for supporting the People's
Assembly we are a broad-base activist
group that will not give up until there
is a better world and honestly just
thank so much futures in your hands glad
to be with you thank you
