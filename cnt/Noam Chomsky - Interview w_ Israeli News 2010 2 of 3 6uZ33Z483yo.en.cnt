now their ship it's you know I two weeks
ago I interviewed ership it's on on this
show and he said that quote you are our
enemies biggest assets are Israeli
Bastion Jews like professor Chomsky
that's a problem for Dershowitz I have
no interest in what he said he said I
mean if you want the truth he's a
dedicated a liar who's been exposed over
and over again
he didn't quote me you notice he didn't
because he knows better than to quote by
the way he offered to come to birthday
to debate you do you think that they
would invite a person like there
shaboots to come and talk and be recite
you have to ask for it that doesn't make
any difference to me but I mean I've
agreed to debate him reluctantly because
he's extremely dishonest but I'd do it
but but this issue is absurd there's
nothing to debate
I mean Israel should have the rights of
any state period it wants more because
it's right to exist is questionable on
other many other states in the world but
no state the United States doesn't
demand that Mexico accept the right of
the United States to exist
sitting on half of Mexico because there
isn't a threat when you hear and listen
what Hamas leaders say what Iran leaders
says with Hizballah leaders say you
understand that there's an immediate
threat easily you don't understand that
in 1970s when this claim was made for
the first time as far as I know it was
when Egypt in 1971 offered Israel a full
peace treaty full peace treaty nothing
for the Palestinians 1971 Israel
rejected it because it would have meant
withdrawal from the Sinai it's the only
state I know of which wants recognition
of its right to exist is there any
relevance to the fact that you're Jewish
do you think when you make these claims
when you when you you mean your region
is all right since I'm Jewish and since
I have a special relationship with
Israel since childhood and since I care
about it I think it should take
positions that are moral realistic and
appropriate for its own decent survival
aren't you afraid that even you if you
feel that you're working
for Israel your arguments and your the
very articulate and making your
arguments and are well heard because of
your world reputations aren't you afraid
that these arguments will be misused
from the academic boycott to to the
nuclear weapon and Iran
well actually the academic boycott if
you bother to read is one that I've
opposed its cause but it's true it's
true that my statements will be misused
for example by their Jewett's who is
very dangerous for Israel but yes he
he's dangerous for Israel extremely and
he distorts and this represents my
statements in ways which help his cause
of supporting Israeli aggression and
expansion which is very dangerous for
his room even if I can understand or try
to understand the academic philosophical
approval of a person like you for the
freedom of speech even if Holocaust
deniers not even which specifically it
specifically for views you detest that
for which you call for a certain point
because history has proved otherwise I
mean you're doesn't matter because
you're taking a lot of responsibility I
believe in freedom of speech for Alan
Dershowitz even though the record of his
exposed lies is incredible you're
bothered by Josephus lies and you're not
bothered by the lies of Holocaust
deniers on our country I'm not manat
saying I'm bothered by the earth it's
wise and I say yes we should insist on
the freedom of speech for dedicated
liars and in the case of say the
Holocaust denial yeah that's of course
outrageous just as it's outrageous to
deny what we did namely wiping out
millions of Indians but you know the
number one I think argument against what
you preach for is the double standard
double standard it's saying that you
know from talking of freedom of speech
and countries where freedom of speech is
does not exist you're going to Lebanon
tomorrow or when you go to even here in
Jordan I don't think it's limited to
compared to Israel is Israel as bad as
other countries did I ever say that you
spend so much time targeting Israel did
the international asked me to give a
talk that they could use to criticize
human rights violations in Israel no
they did it for Syria but you said you
have to limit the time looking in the
map in the world there are so many
problems why is Israel in the center
Israel still if you look around is you
know is trying and struggling is trying
to give democracy away and it has gay
rights and human rights if you started
by asking why is Israel in the center
answer it isn't not for me what's in the
center for me is the United States and
for a very elementary moral reason the
moral principle is we are responsible
for our own actions and their
consequences every crime that Israel
commits is because of u.s. participation
and authorization so any decent American
citizen even without a special interest
in Israel as I have should have these in
the center of their attention because
those are the ones we're participating
in we're responsible for and what is
worse than your eyes the actions in
Israel and in the territories or for
example what's going on in Afghanistan
how do you how do you prioritize these -
there's no way - because I talked about
both of them all the time is Israel as
what's going on in Israel as severe as
what's going on Darfur Afghanistan let's
say down in the case of Darfur yes the
crimes are worse but there is much less
that I could do about them much less
nothing in fact so yes it's fine to sign
petitions criticizing them but there's
no moral value delete it and you feel
moral value because you're a citizen of
the US and B you have connections to
Israel and you feel that you're part of
the let's put aside the personal
connection to Israel which is there but
if I had no connection to Israel at all
as simply as an American citizen
okay would be of prime concern because
the u.s. is decisively involved Israel
for example could not attack Gaza could
not carry out the occupation and so on
without decisive and direct US
diplomatic military and economic support
