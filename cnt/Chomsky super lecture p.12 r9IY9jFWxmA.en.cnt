what about the idea that the Cold War
serves certain ideological and political
purposes for the US and now the u.s. is
seeking a new paradigm there's something
true about the fact that the Cold War
paradigm was extremely useful as a way
of controlling people so like they take
the labor movement you know one of the
ways of controlling undermining and
destroying the labor movement was
weeding out the activist elements on the
principle that there are somehow not
loyal enough to the state at this time
of you know when the enemy is at our
throats well like any propaganda even
the most vulgar propaganda that comes
out at Stalinist Russia there's always
some thread of truth to it he just
couldn't have propaganda that doesn't
have some you know marginal element of
truth and there was some marginal
element of truth here too but it wasn't
very real it's like the Cuba case you
know so yes this has been a very
terrific hammer to use over people's
heads and it was understood i should say
if you haven't read it yet you should
read NSC 68 which was everybody agrees
was the fundamental cold word document
it's kind of interesting that its
content everybody recognizes it as the
major document but nobody quotes with
very few exceptions on one but i have a
book called deterring democracy which in
the first chapter has a lot of extensive
quotes from NSC 68 it's april nineteen
fifty and it sort of laid out the basic
picture of the Cold War and it's quite
fascinating to read for one thing
because when you can see why diplomatic
historians don't quote it this was
written by the real hot shots you know
Dean Acheson Paul net see all these
smart guys it reads like a bunch of
Raving lunatics you know I don't take my
word for it read it you know I mean I
concede I picked out the most dramatic
examples but read the whole thing if you
feel like it's not that long in my view
it sounds like a bunch of Raving
lunatics which is why nobody ever sites
it but they do make some points I mean
the picture they tell is kind of a fairy
tale you know on one hand there's
absolute evil that's the other side it's
kind of like a fairy tale you'd be
embarrassed to read your grand
there's this total absolute evil you
know the Kremlin this and that which is
planning to destroy the whole world and
everything that ever existed and so on
on the other side there's utter
perfection that's us you know we're like
super angels the only thing we ever do
is you work you know slave for the
benefit of this and that and it's
portrayed in the picture of a you know
as a an exaggerated fair parody of a
fairy tale there's never any evidence
given because it's just like a matter of
definition they say it's it's a it's in
it it's an essential nature of the
Kremlin that it acts this way so you
don't have to even give evidence because
it's just part of their nature and its
essential property of Aaron nature that
we do this sort of thing okay so there's
no evidence given in fact there is
evidence scattered around very carefully
scattered around so that anybody is
going to look for it's not hard time
finding it and when you find when you do
put together the evidence I did in the
same book you find that it completely
undermines whatever thesis they have
about relative power but forgetting that
then comes the proposals the proposals
are we're involved in a real war to real
war you know the Cold War we have to
fight it like a war to prevent this
monstrous thing from destroying
everything and allowing utter perfection
and magnificence to win and in a war
you've got to have things like just
suppression we have to have suppression
of dissent among us one of our
weaknesses is that were too tolerant and
to open and to free they say that you
know and that's a weakness so we have to
have just suppression and control of
dissent and you know make sure that
everybody's obedient and so on and the
way to do it is through they also call
for military Keynesianism that means
transferring public funds to private
industry which was a big issue then
because everybody knew that the economic
system is not going to function without
a tremendous amount of public funding
state funding port in so that was
crucial and that's true of the
International economy to at that time
very heavily reliant on military
spending to revitalize it the and they
know all that and it's laid out but also
that it would be an ideological weapon
it would be a weapon to control people
and that's true it was I mean from then
until the game started to go away in
1989 round then it was a tremendous
weapon of flood control anything you
wanted the block just yell or do you
know y'all cold war didn't matter how
crazy it was sometimes there was some
truth to it sometimes not so yes you
need a new paradigm okay because how we
going to beat people over the head now
that we don't have that around anymore
and if you look through the 80s it was
already obvious through the 1980s that
this stuff is going to lose its efficacy
you'd have to be a big genius to figure
out that the Soviet Union was in trouble
so you look at stuff say I was writing
since the early 80s have been saying
look they're going to have to go to
something else and in fact right through
the 80s there's an almost desperate
search for something else you know
international terrorism or crazed Arabs
or Hispanic narco-traffickers there
something or other that we have to
defend ourselves against or otherwise
how you going to control everybody okay
domestic crime mostly manufactured you
know us doesn't have crime levels very
different from other industrial
countries it doesn't in fact but as very
different perception of crime welfare
queens you know sort of by implication
black driving around and Cadillacs and
you know that sort of thing so there's
all sorts of effort to you know
manufacture enemies for people to hate
but a foreign enemy is much better and
so here's where the science of
government comes in now let's to get
back to this clash of civilizations
thing Huntington's you know everybody is
flailing around for some paradigm you
know some big thing that you can use to
control people and Huntington's idea as
clash of civilizations so you know
there's Islam and US and all these other
things and the reason why the world if
the idea is the reason why the world is
so disorderly is because you've got all
you know with a cold war gone you've got
all these ethnic groups killing each
other and so on well as usual it's
always a good idea to start by asking
about the facts whenever you hear
anything said very confidently the first
thing that should come to mind is wait a
minute is that true you know so is it
true I mean is it true that there's more
ethnic conflict now than there was 20
years ago well take a look
I in most of the big conflicts that are
going on around the world are we're
going on right through the Cold War like
Burundi and Rwanda not huge maskers
going on in the early 70s actually I
wrote about him at the time nobody was
talking about him because it wasn't
interesting but they were there there
are some the in fact or take say you
know in fact just about everyone you
pick goes way back now there are some
that are new those in within the former
Soviet system including Yugoslavia you
know within the old so-called communist
system yeah they're new so like the war
in Chechnya or you know Azerbaijan
Armenia you know tajikistan these things
are all new but that's standard anytime
a tyrannical system breaks down you have
all sorts of conflict internal to it
just take a look at the breakdown of the
European empires every single one was
like that Muslim were worse so first of
all the very factual basis is very thin
now what about the principal clash of
civilizations like say the big bad guy
is Islam whether a few problems with
that our the most fundamentalist Islamic
state in the world is our big Ally Saudi
Arabia how's that fit you know I mean
Saudi Arabia's are real it's not
Fundamentalist enough for some of the
people in it but it's pretty extreme are
we trying to undermine Saudi Arabia of
course not they're sitting on all the
oil you know in fact there are clients
that's a family to tater ship we keep in
power because they make sure that the
money from oil doesn't go to the people
of the region that goes to London in New
York so they're okay there's no clash of
civilizations there that's state
fundamental what about individual you
know like knots non-state well by far
the worst ones are the guys who are
tearing Afghanistan the pieces you find
create more crazy Islamic fundamentalist
around the nanite
know about them where they get their
power from your pocket you know they got
six billion dollars or so it's claimed
from the United States and Saudi Arabia
and through the 1980s now they're
tearing Afghanistan apart but it's not
our you know nothing like we did you
know we're only wonderful people so how
where is this clash of civilizations
between Islam in the West I don't see it
I mean Indonesia is a Islamic state DC
us trying to undermine Indonesia I mean
a lot of rotten things in Indonesia like
for example wages are about half the
level of China which is not so
munificent to see us doing anything
about that I mean I I think this is all
for us you know I mean I don't mean to
say total force like there must be a new
paradigm you know something that people
can build their careers on and write
books about and so on and so forth which
can then be turned into a device of
controlling people that part is true and
maybe this will work or if it doesn't
you try something else
