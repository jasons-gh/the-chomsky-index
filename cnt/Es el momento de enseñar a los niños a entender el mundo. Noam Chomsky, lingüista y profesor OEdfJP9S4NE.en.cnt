The current situation is very serious, 
you don't have to tell anyone in Spain. 
The virus, we should understand 
as the result of a colossal market failure. 
It is important to understand the context 
if we want to avoid future reappearances 
of catastrophes like this. 
At some point, it will end, 
but the cost can be very high. 
It was known that there was very likely to be a pandemic, 
including one for coronavirus. 
It was something pretty obvious to scientists 
after the SARS epidemic in 2003. 
The genome was sequenced and a vaccine was created, 
and it was all over, but the cost was very high. 
And it was immediately predicted that other coronaviruses would appear 
and that we should prepare for it. 
The foundations were laid, 
but there needs to be someone to pick up the testimonial and move on. 
Who did it? 
No one. 
We will recover from all this, 
we have recovered from worse pests, 
the cost will be terrible, but we will partly recover. 
Maybe we'll even recover completely in a long time. 
The courage and heroism of those who fight on the front lines 
against the pandemic, 
Doctors, Nurses, Health Workers, 
they are admirable. 
Local communities have organized and helped each other. 
Schools are closed, 
the children are at home, the parents cannot work. 
But in this kind of situation, 
in which we live in a very fragile system, 
which can go awry if nothing goes wrong 
but in which everything collapses when there is a catastrophe, 
education will also collapse. 
And we have much deeper problems 
about the kind of education system we want. 
Do we want a society in which we treat children 
as containers where we pour water and something comes out of it? 
Or we want an education system that encourages creativity, 
participation, cooperation 
and encourage you to meet your goals 
and take advantage of the possibilities 
that open before you to pursue your interests? 
I don't think it's a matter of telling them, 
but to provide them with the stimuli and opportunities 
for them to follow their own creative instinct, 
so that they explore the world as much as they can, 
on the Internet if it is the only one they have; 
to do creative activities, 
such as writing, drawing, 
or build things that help them understand the world. 
This can be done at any level. 
For example, there is an interesting project 
which has been done with older students 
in which the following question is asked to them: 
How does a mosquito fly in the rain? 
If we calculate the pressure exerted by a raindrop 
about a mosquito, 
that can be calculated, 
it is so large that it would crush a human being. 
So how does a mosquito fly in the rain? 
As they study it they learn a little physics, 
a little bit of biology, of our organisms, and so on. 
Many similar projects can be done, 
which give children the opportunity 
to satisfy his natural curiosity 
so that they can make them understand things about the world. 
And it can be done in all areas. 
Literature, History, whatever. 
That should be education, and it can be achieved. 
Of course at home, where there is no interaction between children, 
it is more difficult, but not impossible.
