Israel immediately back down sugar was
replaced by Shimon Peres much more
diplomatic essentially carried out the
same policies but in a much more polite
fashion and that conflict was over well
something like that is happening right
now but the situation is different first
of all Israel is a different country now
it's special in the last few years it's
moved very far to the ultra-nationalist
and religious right and it is behaving
pretty rationally that's what happens
when you get ultra nationalist religious
forces in charge if God is on your side
it doesn't matter what you do you know
that for other places and that's now a
significant non-trivial tendency in
Israel the other difference is that the
United States is not what it was for a
number of reasons one reason is that the
United States now has armies in the
field and various Wars of the region and
you probably read General Petraeus is
coming that finally here for those of
you in tears ate a microphone just went
on just no time the Petraeus mein
general in the region made a statement
that was widely publicized and she said
that Israeli intransigence is harming US
soldiers in the field well he person
withdrew the statement he must have been
under White House pressure to shut up so
he withdrew the statement however the
same comments have been made by other
people with high positions high in
intelligence in the military and is now
strain and us thinking now if that
reaches the public has really reached
the public yet but if it reached the
public it could set off a huge wave of
anti-semitism in the United States I'm
the idea that somebody is acting in a
way to harm our brave boys defend
from terror that's not going to sell and
there is a split of a kind in American
Planning between the traditional support
which has plenty of basis and a new
strain of because of concern about the
effect for US interests of this
intransigent policy another change is
that US public opinion has been changing
quite considerably the virtually
reflexive unanimous support for anything
that Israel did is eroding in the Jewish
community to what's happening
particularly since Gaza is just too
inconsistent with sort of standard
values to be easily tolerated that's
very easy to see changes in public
opinion now they haven't affected policy
and they have not affected the media so
you don't see any indication of it in
what you read but the indications are
pretty clearly there on the ground well
for the most part public opinion is
disregarded in policy on almost every
issue but not entirely you can't dismiss
it totally and sooner or later may have
an impact well those are changes and
i'll make my last final statement after
two final statement there there is an
analogy that is very worth thinking
about but many analyses are drawn
between Israel and South Africa most of
them I think are at least misleading if
not totally wrong but there's one which
is not discussed which is significant it
goes back to the early 60s by then the
early 1960s that white South Africa
recognized that it's becoming very
isolated in the world the South Africa
was becoming a pariah state and the
sapphire
foreign minister spoke to the American
ambassador in South Africa about this
the reports of recently been released he
told the American ambassador he said
look well no everybody's voting against
us in the United Nations but you and I
both know that there's only one vote in
the United Nations that's yours and as
long as you're backing us it doesn't
matter what the rest of the world thinks
well thats pretty much predicts what
happened the United States kept backing
them until the late 1980s as late as
1988 Nelson Mandela and the African
National Congress were designated by the
Reagan administration as among the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
like Mandela just got his permission it
was removed from the terrorist list last
year just to indicate how far this went
now he can enter the United States
without special permission but up to
nineteen eighty-eight the u.s. continued
tobacco was strong the sanctions
movement the divestment and
congressional resolutions it didn't
matter us kept backing them and as late
as the late 1980s South Africa looked as
if it completely victorious I mean the
opposition forces had been destroyed
they were doing anything they wanted in
the world attacking Angola Mozambique
maintaining apartheid it looked as if
whose nothing was going to change well
the u.s. changed its policy 1990 roughly
the u.s. changed its policy mandela was
let out of prison they were moved
towards some sort of change in internal
policy within a few years apart I was
gone well it's not the only case now
that's the way the world works and I
think Israel today is rather similar in
its internal the way it's behaving
internally to
the way south africa was during the
period when the US was no dinner in the
back and i think there's a lesson there
another treading on pretty dangerous
turf actually you know keeping me from
talking bears aid is a very minor
example of this from their point of view
is a very irrational Act doesn't matter
much but it's an irrational Act
humiliating the ambassador of Turkey was
a much more irrational Act but things
like this are happening and it's a sign
of opportunities for pressing for a
diplomatic settlement not perfect but at
least reasonable in the short term maybe
our way toward something else and I
think this reality's should not be
overlooked
