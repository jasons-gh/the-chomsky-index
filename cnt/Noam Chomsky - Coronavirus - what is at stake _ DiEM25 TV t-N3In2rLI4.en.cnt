Bouziane Hassan translation Welcome to a different world after the Coronavirus 
Virus I am really happy and my honor 
This episode is special because there is 
A special guest, join us today. 
And this special guest isn't just me 
It's a hero for several generations. 
Unfortunately, we both are 
Isolation, so this is also very special 
Appropriate, but without further introduction 
I think most of you, who are watching this 
I know who I am ostrich Chomsky and me 
Very pleased that Naoum will join us today. 
Hi Noam, can you just tell us, 
Where are you? Are you really? 
Isolation and for how long? 
Well, I'm in Tucson, Arizona 
Self-isolation. 
So, I wrote, I was born in 1928 
I wrote your first article, as far as 
I know, when you were only ten years old, 
Which was an article on Spanish 
Civil war. Actually after the fall 
Barcelona and so it was 1938, 
Which seems too far from 
jelly. I survived the second 
World War, Hiroshima, I was a witness 
To Hiroshima, I have been witness to many 
A very important historical political 
Events, from the Vietnam War to Oil 
Crisis, to the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
Before that, where is the witness 
To Chernobyl, then in the 1990s, 
You are a witness to a historic moment 
That led to 9/11, which was also 
International and recent event 
I'm trying to really shorten a long time 
The life history of someone like you, 
But the last event was 
Financial Crash of 2007 and 2008. 
So in this background, such a rich life 
To be a witness and an actor as well 
These major historical processes, "how 
You look at the current corona virus 
crisis? Is it unprecedented historical? 
The event, is something stunned 
You are? How do you look at it? That would 
Be my question. 
I must say that is my first memories 
Who is chasing me now, is who 
1930s, the article you mentioned 
In the fall of Barcelona he was mainly acting 
About, it seems, a ruthless spread 
From the fascist plague all over, 
Across Europe and how it will end. 
Then, I found out later, When 
Internal documents came out, that 
US government analyst, at the time 
The following years predicted that 
The war will end, the war will end 
Coming, that the war will end, 
The world split into the air dominated by the United States 
Regions and area controlled by Germany. 
So my childhood worries weren't completely 
Misplaced. These memories come back 
right Now. I remember, as a child, prof 
A young child listens to Nuremberg to Hitler 
Marches over the radio, I could not 
Understand the words but you can easily 
Understanding mood and threat 
Etc., and I must say when I'm listening 
Donald Trump rallies today, reverberate. 
It is not that it is a fascist, it is not 
She has a lot of ideology, 
He is just a sociopath, but an individual 
Cares about himself but temperament and 
Fears are similar and the idea is that 
The fate of the country and the world in 
Hands sociopathy collector is 
shocking. The coronavirus is dangerous enough 
But it is worth noting that there is 
We are approaching the greatest horror 
The race to the brink of disaster, much worse 
Then anything that happened in a human 
History. And Donald Trump and his followers 
They are in the lead, in the race to the abyss. 
In fact, there are two enormous threats 
We are facing. The first is the growing threat 
Nuclear war, exacerbating it 
The remaining arms were torn 
Control system and the other is of course 
The growing threat of global warming. 
Both threats can be dealt with, but none 
Much of the time the corona virus is 
Terrible can have terrifying consequences 
But there will be a rebound, while 
Others will not be recovered, it is over. 
If we don't deal with them, we are finished. 
And this is how childhood memories come 
Return to haunt me, but different 
The dimension. Threat of nuclear war 
You have no idea where the world is 
Really, given early, 
Until January, you know 
Every year the clock is set on Judgment Day and set 
With the minute hand at a certain distance 
From midnight, which means termination. 
However, since Trump was elected 
The minute hand moves closer and 
Closer to midnight. Last year it was two 
Minutes until midnight. Top matching 
Highest level ever. This year 
Analysts began cutting out minutes, it started 
Move to seconds, 100 seconds until midnight 
This is the closest it has ever been. 
Seeing three things: a threat 
Nuclear war and the global warming threat 
Democracy degradation that 
It doesn't belong here completely 
But it is, because this is the only one, 
We hope we have, 
To overcome the crisis 
And in the (inaudible) audience 
Take control of their fate, if that 
Doesn't happen, we are doomed. 
If we leave our fate 
The sociopathic buffalo, we're done. 
This is getting closer, Trump 
It's the worst, that's because 
The power of the United States, which is overwhelming. 
We are talking about the retreat of the United States, 
But you just look at the world, 
Do not see it when the United States 
Imposes penalties, killers, 
Devastating penalties, that is 
The only country that can do that, 
But everyone should follow. 
You might not actually like Europe 
Hate acts against Iran, however 
They have to follow, they are 
They must follow the teacher, otherwise 
He is expelled from the International 
Financial system. This is not a law 
Nature is a decision in Europe 
Affiliated to Mr. In 
Washington and other countries 
I don't even have a choice. 
Going back to Coronavirus, 
One of the most shocking, 
From its harsh aspect, it is a use of 
Penalties, to increase pain, 
Consciously, Iran 
In a region, huge internal problems. 
By the throttle tightened 
Consciously designed penalties 
Frankly, to make suffering and suffering 
Bitterly now. Cuba is suffering 
From it, from the moment you gained it 
Independence, but it's amazing, 
They survived, but they stayed 
Flexible and one of the most cynical 
The elements of the virus crisis today, is that Cuba 
Helps Europe. I mean this as well 
Shocking, you don't know how 
To describe it. Germany cannot help 
Greece, but Cuba can help the Europeans 
Countries. If you stop thinking 
What does that mean, all words fail, 
Like you see thousands of people 
Dying in the Mediterranean, Varenne 
From the area destroyed 
For centuries it is sent to death 
In the Mediterranean, you don't know 
What words to use. 
The crisis, the civilizational crisis 
The West at this point is devastating, 
To think about it, it brings 
Even childhood memories of listening to 
Hitler cheers on the radio to the loud crowds 
Makes you wonder if these are the types 
Even viable. 
You mentioned the crisis of democracy, 
At this moment I think we have found ourselves 
Also on a date never seen before 
The situation, in the sense that approx 
Two billion people, that's a number I've found 
Today, one way or another 
Confined in the house, be it isolation, 
Self-isolation or quarantine. 
Almost 2 billion people in the world 
At home, if they are lucky enough 
a house. At the same time we can 
Witness is that Europe, but also other 
Countries, closed their borders, 
Not only the internal but the external borders. 
There is an exceptional property everywhere 
Countries we can think of, which means 
Curfews in many countries, 
Such as France, Serbia, Spain, Italy and 
Other countries, an army in the streets 
And what I want to ask of you as a linguist, 
Is the language of length that is now, 
Spin around. If you just not listen 
To Donald Trump, if you listen to him 
Macron, and some other European countries 
Politicians, you'll hear that constantly 
They talk about war. 
Even the media is talking about it 
Doctors who are on the first front 
Streak and the virus is called the enemy. 
It reminds me of course, 
Not from childhood memories, fortunately however 
A book written at the time, 
Victor Klimbrier, "Lingua tertii imperii" 
Which book is a book about 
The language of the Third Reich and 
In any way through language, 
Ideology was imposed, so who 
Your point of view, what does this speech do 
About the war, tell us and why they are present 
The virus is an enemy, is it only 
Legalizing a new state of exception or 
Is there something deeper in that 
Dialogue? 
Speech protection, but I think it is 
do not make it too much. It has some significance. 
The meaning is that if we want to deal 
With the crisis, we must act 
To something like packing in wartime. 
So if you think of a rich country, 
Like the United States, it has the resources 
To overcome the immediate economic 
Second fill 
World war, I led the country to far the limits 
Greater debt than is imagined today 
It was a very successful mobilization, 
Practically the United States quadrupled 
Industrialization, recession ended, left 
Country with [inaudible] instead, but prof 
The ability to grow. This is less than we need 
Perhaps, not on this scale is not like that 
This is in a world war, but we need to 
Social Movement Mindset ??? 
It is trying to overcome the short term 
Severe crisis. We are here too, 
We can remember the swine flu epidemic 
In 2009, it was raised in the United States 
Hundreds of thousands of people, 
At first glance recovered from 
The worst, but it must be dealt with, 
This is a rich country like the states. 
Now there are two billion people, 
The majority is in India. What happens 
For Indians, they live from hand to mouth, 
Who is isolated, starving to death. 
What is gonna happen? 
In a civilized world rich countries 
They will help after that 
Who needed, instead of strangling 
Them, and that's what we do, 
Especially in India but in many 
Globalism. The type of crisis, you know 
Whether the crisis could be within 
A country like India, I don't know, bears 
Mind that, with current trends 
If South Asia continues, it will 
Be uninhabitable in a few decades. 
The temperature has reached 50 degrees, 
In Rajasthan this summer and it's 
increasing. Water now, 
It can get worse, there are two nuclear types 
Powers, they will fight 
Restriction of low water supply. 
I mean, the corona virus is very dangerous, 
We can't underestimate it, but we have to 
Remember it is a small, small portion 
Part of the next major crisis 
Along. May not disrupt life 
The extent, which the corona virus does today, 
But they will disrupt life to an extent 
Which makes the species neither viable nor viable 
In the distant future. 
So we have many problems to deal with, 
Well, that's immediate, coronavirus 
Seriously, you must deal with it and 
Much bigger, much bigger, 
They are waving. Now, there is 
Civilization crisis, we have to end 
Maybe the good side of the corona virus, 
As it might, it might bring people into thinking 
What world do we want? 
Do we want the kind of world that drives 
To this? We must think 
The origins of this crisis, why is there 
Corona virus crisis? It is a huge market 
Failure, back to the essence 
From the markets, exacerbated by neoliberalism, 
Brutal, intensified neoliberalism 
Profound socio-economic problems. 
It was known for a long time, 
Epidemics are highly probable, and they were 
Understood, well understood, that 
It is possible that there will be a pandemic of the corona virus 
Minor modifications for SARS 
Pandemic, 15 years ago it was overcome, 
Viruses identified and sequenced, 
Vaccines were available, labs around 
The world can work right then 
Develop protection for potentials 
Coronavirus pandemic. 
Why didn't they do that? 
Market signals were wrong. 
Pharmaceutical companies, we delivered it 
Our fate to your tyranny, wait 
Companies that are not accountable 
For the public, in this case, a great pharma 
And for them they make new body creams, 
It's more profitable than finding it 
A vaccine that protects people from 
Of mass destruction. Impossible 
Government to intervene, and back to 
Mobilization in wartime, that's what happened 
Polio at that time, I remember too 
Well it was a terrifying threat, it was over 
By discovering a Salik vaccine by 
A government institution launched before 
Roosevelt Administration. No patents 
Available to everyone. Maybe 
It was done this time, but neoliberal 
The plague prevented it. 
We live under an ideology for it 
Economists have a good amount of 
Responsibility, and it comes from 
Common sector. An ideology, namely 
It boils down to reading Ronald Reagan 
It was on the script, by his company 
Gentlemen with his sunny smile, saying 
The government is the problem. Let's get rid of it 
The government, that is to say, let's help 
Concerning decisions of private despotism, 
That are not accountable to the public. 
On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, 
Thatcher was ordering us there 
A society, in which individuals are only thrown 
The market to survive one way or another 
Moreover, there is no alternative. 
The world is suffering underneath 
Rich, years it is now in point 
Where things, which can be done, 
Like direct government intervention 
On the scale of the Salik invention 
Vaccine, but it has been banned 
Ideological reasons get out of 
Neoliberal plague, the point is that 
It could be this corona virus epidemic 
Was blocked, the information was there 
To read, he was actually well known in it 
October 2019, just before the outbreak. 
There was an extensive simulation, 
By simulating the level in the United States, 
In the world of a potential epidemic 
This type. Nothing has been done now 
Then the crisis got worse than before 
Betrayal of political regimes. 
We did not pay attention to the information 
Which they were aware of on December 31, 
China has informed the World Health Organization 
Regulating pneumonia, such as symptoms 
With unknown etiology. after a week, 
They identified, some Chinese scholars, 
I identified it as Corona virus, 
On top of that they serialized it and gave it 
Information to the world, by then 
Virologists, others who were bothering 
To read the WHO report 
He knew, they were Corona virus and 
They know how to handle it. 
Did they do anything, well, some of them did. 
Region Countries, China, 
South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore have all started 
They do something and they kind of have them 
To a large extent it appears to be containment, at least 
The first boom of the crisis. 
It happened in Europe to some extent. 
Germany didn't have it 
She moved, at the appointed time, to have the hospital 
Sub-liberal regimes, 
It has spare and diagnostic capacity 
He was able to act extremely selfishly 
Fashion, not helping others but for itself 
At least, for reasonable fit 
Other countries just ignored it, the worst 
Them are the UK and 
The worst of it was the United States, 
Which is happening led by [inaudible] 
Who says, you know that one day there isn't 
Crisis, it's like the flu the next day 
I knew it was a terrible crisis 
All day long, we have to give out 
For business, because I have to win 
election. Idea in the world 
These hands are awesome, but the point is 
It started with her, once again, enormous 
Market failure with reference to the fundamental 
Problems of the socio-economic system, 
It made neoliberalism much worse 
The plague continues due to 
Collapse of types of institutions 
Structures, which you can deal with, if 
have been working. 
These are the topics you should be 
I think seriously and think 
In more depth, as I said, 
What kind of world do we want to live in? 
If we beat one way or another, there is 
Options will be. Options range from 
An extremely authoritarian installation 
Brutal states all the way to the radical 
Reconstruction of the community and more 
Humanistic terminology, concerned with human needs 
Your profit. That we must bear 
Mind you, that authoritarian vicious circle 
Countries are fully compatible with 
Liberalism, in fact, [inaudible] 
Neoliberalism from [inaudible] to Hayek 
The rest, they were very happy 
Huge state violence, as long as it is 
They supported what they called the sound 
Economics. Neoliberalism has its origins 
In Vienna in the 1920s, from [inaudible] 
Can hardly contain his joy, in 
Primitive Fascism of the Austrian State 
They smashed trade unions 
Austrian Social Democracy and joined 
The early fascist government, praised 
on him. Fascism is, in fact, praised by reason 
Protect his healthy economy. 
When Pinochet installed a killer 
A brutal dictatorship in Chile, all of them 
Love him, they all fought there, [inaudible] 
Help out from this wonderful 
Miracle, she was bringing sound 
Economy, big profit for her, for the sake of harnessing 
A small portion of the population. 
So, it is not impossible to think 
It could be the barbaric neoliberal system 
Reinstall it by self-call 
Liberals with a strong state 
Violence, impose, this is one part, 
One nightmare, it might happen. 
But it is not necessary, there is 
The potential to organize people, 
She becomes involved, as many do, 
And achieve a much better world, 
That you will also face enormous 
The problems were facing right 
The way, the problems of nuclear war, 
It is closer than it was before 
Environmental problems 
There is no disaster of it 
Recovery once we get to that stage, 
It is not far away, unless we are 
Act assertive. 
So it is a defining moment for a human being 
History, not just because of the aura 
The virus, but to bring us, must bring us 
Awareness of deep imperfections 
The world is flawed, not strong enough, profound, 
Dysfunctional characteristics 
The whole social and economic system, 
That should be [inaudible], if 
There will be a viable future. 
So this can be a warning sign and 
A lesson to deal with it today or prevent it 
From the blast, but think about it 
The roots and how those roots will be 
Lead to more crises, worse than this, 
Pay extra on the spot. 
And since we don't have much time, 
I'll just ask one last question, yeah, so, 
I think a lot of people are interested in and 
We, too, are the ones who are active in the social sphere 
Movements, mobilization and 
Organized for decades, using the physical and 
Social convergence between people, however 
Suddenly we're all together 
Accustomed to what is now called 
"Social distancing," so my questions are 
How do you see a social future 
Resistance, in times of social distancing 
And if that takes another few months, 
Not to mention maybe a year or two, 
We are mainly in self-isolation 
Home, what is your advice 
Progressives around the world, activists, 
Also intellectuals, students and workers, 
How to organize in this new situation? 
And can you tell us maybe the humidity 
Seeing hope, instead of entering 
Global tyranny, that's open 
The historical situation may go drastically 
The world turned, and who would 
They are green, equal, fair and complete 
Solidarity? 
First of all, we must bear in mind that, 
In the past few years, there has been prof 
A form of social isolation, and it is an end 
Harmful. Now you go to 
McDonald's and look at a bunch of 
Teens sitting around the table, 
Having a hamburger, what you see is, 
Two conversations are taking place. One kind of 
Shallow discussion between them, 
The last one, everyone has it 
On his cell phone, with a remote control 
An individual who is with a friend. 
This has resulted in the fragmentation and isolation of people 
To an extraordinary extent. 
Thatcher principle, it was not there 
Society, escalated, misused 
Social media, which people have turned into 
Very isolated creatures, especially young ones 
People. Actually there are universities, 
Now in the United States, where 
On the sidewalk boards on it, saying, 
Look for. Because every child walks 
Around it, it is glued to itself. This is a shape 
From self-induced social isolation, which 
It was extremely harmful. We are now on 
Real state of social isolation. I did it 
To overcome it by reconnecting social 
Any way it can be done, from 
Need if any kind can help 
Needy. Call them, 
Organizational development, expansion 
Analysis, like before I get it 
To be functional and efficient, 
Make plans for the future, 
Gathering people together he can 
Internet era to join and deliberate consultation 
To find out answers to the problems 
That they encounter and work on, 
Which can be done, not face to face 
That connections to humans 
Basic. But she will be deprived of it 
For a while, you can put it on hold to find another 
Ways and continue with and 
Indeed, expanding and deepening activities 
Implemented, can be done, will not happen 
To be easy, but humans ran into a problem 
Can I ask a question, because we're both 
In self-isolation? 
My dog   is trying to have a conversation? 
Was that before a parrot? You have 
A bird as well or a parrot? Or a bird, 
There was a bird sound, yeah? 
Yes ????? Parrot, might say: 
Sovereignty to all people 
Portuguese.
