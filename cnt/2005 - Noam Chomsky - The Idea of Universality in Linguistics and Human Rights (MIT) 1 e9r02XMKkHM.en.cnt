thank you everyone for coming my name is
Bala Krishnan rajagopal I teach in the
Department of Urban Studies and planning
and I'm also the faculty director of the
MIT program on human rights and justice
it gives me great pleasure to welcome
you all to the continuation of our
lecture series during this academic year
on science technology and human rights
and this is a third of the lecture
series we still have two more left we
had two lectures during the fall
semester the series has featured so far
during the fall semester Professor
Rudolf jaenisch
professor of biology at MIT who spoke on
the topic human cloning and human rights
promises and perils
it featured Professor Steven Chu Rover
from the department of brain and
cognitive sciences at MIT on the topic
our brains our selves our common future
neuroscience and the struggle for a more
just participatory in sustainable
society now we have the today the third
lecture in this series and I will
introduce the speaker who all of you
know quite well as well as the topic in
in a short while we still have two more
lectures left one lecture is going to be
by Professor how Abelson from the
Department of Electrical Engineering and
computer science at MIT on the topic
open networks and open society the
relationship between freedom law and
technology and that will be held on
April 26th and finally a lecture by
Professor Curt Godfrey from Cornell
University on the topic science policy
politics and human rights and that will
be held on May 3rd of this year the
series before I introduce the speakers
let me thank a few people first of all
the Dean for undergraduate education
Robert Redwine who has provided generous
and on cynics aport for this series I
should also thank the Center for
International Studies which is where the
human rights program is located and the
Department of Urban Studies and planning
of the department urban studies and
planning in the Center for International
Studies jointly sponsored the program
and human rights and justice I would
also like to thank a few people who
played a key role in making in
organizing this particular event today
as well as the entire series and that is
a first our program coordinator
Susan Frick our assistants m'hijita
Sultana and Bill Misaki as well as many
volunteers who has who have really
generously helped with their time and
effort in this series today's lecture is
titled the idea of universality in
linguistics and human rights and the
person who is going to speak about that
perhaps more qualified than anyone else
at MIT and very few certainly almost
better than anyone else in the world is
professor Noam Chomsky who needs no
introduction here at MIT and certainly
in the entire New England area not to
mention the world professor Noam Chomsky
was was to give a brief summary of his
background was born in 1928 he received
his PhD in linguistics in 1955 from the
University of Pennsylvania he joined the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
here MIT in 1955 and 1961 was appointed
full professor in 1976 he was appointed
Institute professor in the Department of
linguistics and philosophy and his
contributions to the field of
linguistics is so fun
and stellar that I don't need to say
anything really about it his
contributions to our general awareness
of ethical and moral issues and public
policy and foreign policy is also so
stellar and so exemplary that I don't
need to say anything about it these
publications are extremely well known
some of his more recent books are I'll
just try to read out the titles a
generation draws the line new horizons
in the study of language and mind rogue
states 9/11 understanding power on
nature and language pirates and empires
Emperor's old and old and new Middle
East allusions and hegemony or survival
the range and the incredible complexity
of his views obviously making a prime
person to talk about something that is
so incredibly complicated as the topic
of today's lecture
following professor Chomsky's lecture we
will have the pleasure of listening to
Professor Elizabeth Skokie who has
kindly agreed to respond to professor
Chomsky talk professor specky obtained
her PhD in psychology from Cornell
University and has taught in the
psychology departments there as well as
the University of Pennsylvania and now
at Harvard University she was teaching
here at MIT in the department of brain
and cognitive science from 1996 to 2001
and she remains involved at MIT as a
co-director of the mind brain and
behavior inter faculty initiative her
research is on cognition and cognitive
development primarily in human infants
and young children she studies
developing concepts of objects space
number and other people and has authored
numerous articles in several academic
journals she has received fellowships
from the American Association for the
Advancement of science the Guggenheim
Memorial and fulbright-hays among others
and has received many rewards and
recognitions from the National Institute
of Health the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences and the National Academy of
Sciences
it gives me great pleasure now to
welcome professor Chomsky
about quite a few years ago in the 1960s
I agreed in a weak moment to give a talk
with the title language and freedom and
when the time came to think about it I
realized I might have something to say
about language and about freedom but the
word and was posing a serious problem
there is a possible strand that connects
language and freedom actually has an
interesting history of exploring it
primarily in the 18th century but in
substance it's pretty thin and
speculative and if not surprisingly I
have the same problem today there are
useful things I think to say about
universality and language and also about
universality of human rights
but that troublesome connective is still
raising difficulties the only way I can
think of dealing with dilemma is to say
a few things about each of the two
topics with barely a hint about the
conjunction leaving that problem for you
to deal with unless lizz solves it and
her remarks well let me again with
universality and language the most
productive way to approach the problem I
as far as I know is within the framework
of what's come to be called the bio
linguistic perspective in the last 40 or
50 years it's an approach to language
that began to take shape in the early
1950s it was very much influenced then
by recent developments in mathematics
and biology and the approach interacted
productively with a more general shift
of perspective in the general study of
mental faculties sometimes called the
cognitive revolution it would be more
accurate I think to call it a second
maneuver evolution which revived and
extended important insights and
contributions of the cognitive
revolution of the 17th and 18th century
which really deserves the name I think
it was regrettably had been forgotten by
the 1950s fact long before and is still
largely unknown in the 1950s the study
of language and mind was commonly
considered part of what were called the
behavioral sciences all aspects of
sociology psychology and so on well as
the name indicates the object of inquiry
and the behavioral sciences was taken to
be behavior and for linguistics that
meant also the products of behavior like
texts or corpus elicited from native
informant informant linguistic theory
consisted of procedures of analysis
primarily segmentation and
classification it's both European and
American guided by limited assumptions
about structural properties and their
arrangements when prominent theoretician
in 1955 Martin Jo's hardly exaggerated
in an exposition of the field when he
identified the decisive direction as the
decision that language can be described
without any pre-existence scheme of what
a language must be and prevailing
approaches and the behavioral sciences
generally were rather similar it was
very common to suppose that apart from
some initial delimit
