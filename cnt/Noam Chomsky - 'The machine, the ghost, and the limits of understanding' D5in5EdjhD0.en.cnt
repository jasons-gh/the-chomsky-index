welcome everyone I'm Melea Elswick I'm
director CS man and we are extremely
happy to have professor Noam Chomsky
with us
let me just say that he is the most
quoted writer in academia alive now no
comparison at all than anybody else and
I think it's fair to say he is number
one public intellectual in the world
so please professor Chomsky okay I'll
talk some about Isaac Newton and his
contributions to a study of mind that
he's not known for that but I think a
case can be made that he did make
substantial indirect but nevertheless
substantial contributions I'd like to
explain why there is a familiar view
that the early Scientific Revolution
beginning and through the 17th century
provided humans with limitless
explanatory power and that that
conclusion is established more firmly by
Darwin's discoveries theory of evolution
I'm having mine specifically a recent
publication exposition this view by two
distinguished physicist and philosophers
David Albert and David Deutsch
but it's commonly held with may variance
there's a corollary the corollary is
ridicule of what's called by many
philosophers miss Tyrion ISM that's the
absurd notion that there are mysteries
of nature that human intelligence will
never be able to grasp it's of some
interest to notice that this belief is
radically different from the conclusions
of the great figures who actually
carried out the early Scientific
Revolution also interesting to notice
how
in consistent it is with what the theory
of evolution implies and has always been
understood to imply since its origins
and I'd like to say a few words about
those two topics in turn start with
David Humes
the history of England is of course a
chapter on the Scientific Revolution and
in particular on the crucial role of
Isaac Newton who he describes as the
greatest and rarest genius that ever
arose for the ornament and instruction
of the species and Hume concluded that
Newton's greatest achievement was that
while he seemed to draw the veil from
some of the mysteries of nature he
showed at the same time the
imperfections of the mechanical
philosophy and thereby restored nature's
ultimate secrets to that obscurity in
which they ever did and ever will remain
the mechanical philosophy of course was
the guiding doctrine of the Scientific
Revolution it held that the world is a
machine a grander version of the kind of
automata that stimulated the imagination
of thinkers of the time but much in the
way programmed computers do today they
were thinking of the remarkable clocks
the artifacts constructed by skilled
artisans most famous was Jacques de
volcan some devices that imitated the
digestion animal behavior or the
machines that you could find in the
Royal Gardens as you walk through the
pronounced words and when they were
triggered and many other such devices
the mechanical philosophy wanted to
dispense with occult notions do
scholastic notions of forms flitting
through the air sympathies and
antipathies
such are Colt ideas and it wanted to be
hard-headed to keep to what's grounded
in common sense understanding and it in
fact provided the criterion for
intelligibility from Galileo through
Newton and indeed well beyond well it's
well known also that Descartes had
claimed to have explained the phenomena
of the material world in such mechanical
terms while also demonstrating that
they're not all-encompassing don't reach
into the domain of mind his view he
therefore postulated a new principle to
account for what was beyond the reach of
the mechanical philosophy and while this
too was sometimes ridiculed it's in fact
full in accord with normal scientific
not scientific method he was working
within the framework of substance
philosophy so the new principle was a
second substance his race kogatana
and then there's a scientific problem
that he and others faced determining its
character and ask determining how it
interacts with the mechanical world
that's the mind-body problem cast within
the Scientific Revolution that it's a
scientific problem well it was for a
time the mechanical philosophy was
shattered by Newton as humid and with it
went the notion of understanding of the
world that the Scientific Revolution
sought to attain and the mind-body
problem also disappeared and I don't
believe has been resurrected through
this still a lot of talk about what it
those conclusions actually were pretty
well understood in the centuries that
followed they've often been forgotten
today john locke had already reached
conclusions rather similar to Humes
he was exploring the nature of our ideas
and he recognized I'll quote him that
body as far as we can conceive is able
only to strike an effect body and Mo
according to the utmost reach of our
ideas is able to produce nothing but
motion these are the basic tenets of
course of the mechanical philosophy they
yield the conclusion that there can be
no interaction without contact which is
our common sense intuition and modern
research and cognitive science has given
a lot of have given pretty much pretty
solid grounds for Locke's reflections on
the nature of our ideas it's revealed
that our common-sense understanding of
the nature of bodies and their
interactions as no nowadays we would say
in large part genetically determined
it's a lot it's very much as Locke
described very young infants can
recognize a principle of causality
through contact not in any other way if
they recognize causality they seek a
hidden contact somewhere and those in
fact appear to be the limits of our
ideas of our common sense the occult
ideas of the Scholastic's or of Newton
Newtonian attraction it goes beyond our
understanding and is unintelligible at
least by the criteria of the Scientific
Revolution very much like him Locke
concluded therefore that we may we
remain in incurable ignorant of what we
desire to know about matter and its
effects no science of bodies is within
our reach and he went on to say we could
only appeal to the arbitrary
determination of that all-wise agent who
has made them to be and operate as they
do in a manner wholly above our weak
understanding to conceive actually
Galileo had reached much the same
conclusions at the end of his life he
was frustrated by the
failure of the mechanical philosophy is
ideal its failure to account for a
cohesion attraction other phenomena and
he was forced to reject quoting him the
vain presumption of understanding
everything were to conclude even worse
that there is not a single effect in
nature such that the most ingenious
theorist can arrive at a complete
understanding of it actually Descartes
though more optimistic had also
recognized the limits of our cognitive
reach occasionally he's not entirely
consistent about this but a rule eight
of the regular reads if the series of
subjects to be examined if in the series
of subjects to be examined we come to a
subject of which our intellect cannot
gain a good enough intuition
we must stop there and we must not
examine the other matters that follow
but must remain from refrain from futile
toil specifically that Descartes
speculated that the workings of race
kogatana
second subjects substance may be beyond
human understanding so he thought
quoting him again we may not have
intelligence enough to understand the
workings of mind in particular the
normal use of language one of his main
concept he recognized that the normal
use of language as what has come to be
called a creative aspect it's every
every human being but no beast machine
is has this capacity to use language in
ways that are appropriate to situations
but not caused by them as crucial
difference and to formulate and express
thoughts that may be entirely new and to
do so without bound may be incited or
inclined to speak in certain ways by
internal and external circumstances but
not compelled to do so it's the way his
lowers but the matter which was a
mystery to Descartes and remains a
mystery to us though quite clearly as a
fact
well Descartes nevertheless continued
that even if the explanation of normal
use of language and other forms of free
and coherent choice of action even if
that lies beyond our cognitive grasp as
it apparently does that's no reason he
said to question the authenticity of our
experience quite generally he said the
free will which is at the core of this
is the noblest thing we have and there
is nothing we comprehend more evidently
and more perfectly so it would therefore
be absurd to doubt something that we
comprehend intimately and experience
within ourselves namely that the free
actions of men are undetermined merely
because it conflicts with something else
which we know must be by its nature
incomprehensible to us that much like
Lockheed had in mind
divine preordination one of the leading
galileo scholars Peter matcha Mar
observes that by adopting the mechanical
philosophy and thus initiating the
modern Scientific Revolution Galileo had
forged a new model of intelligibility
for human understanding with new
criteria for coherent explanation of
natural phenomena so for Galileo real
understanding requires a mechanical
model that is a device that an artists
artisan could construct least in
principle
hence intelligible to us so Galileo
rejected traditional theories of tides
because as he said we cannot duplicate
them by means of appropriate artificial
devices and his great successors adhere
to these high standards of
intelligibility and explanation so it's
therefore quite understandable why
Newton's discoveries were so stridently
resisted by
the greatest scientists of the day
christiaan huygens described newton's
concept of attraction as an absurdity
Leibniz charged that he was
reintroducing occult ideas similar to
the sympathies and antipathies of
the much ridiculed Scholastic science
and he was offering no physical
explanation for phenomena of the
material world and it's important to
notice that Newton agreed very largely
agreed he wrote that the notion of
action at a distance is inconceivable
it's so great an absurdity that I
believe no man who has in philosophical
matters a competent Faculty of thinking
can ever fall into it as philosophical
means what we call scientific by
invoking that principle he said we
concede that we we do not understand the
phenomena of the material world so a
Newton scholarship recognizes that I'd
be Cohen for example or dukester house
pick someone else points out that by the
word understand that Newton still meant
what his critics meant
understand in mechanical terms of
contact contact action Newton did have a
famous phrase which you all know I for
the phrase I frame no hypotheses and
it's in this context that it appears he
had been unable to discover the physical
cause of gravity so he left the question
open he said to us it is enough that
gravity does really exist and act
according to the laws which we have
explained and abundantly serves to
account for all the motions of the
celestial bodies and of our sea the
tides but while agreeing as he did that
his proposals were so absurd that no
serious scientist could take him
seriously he defended himself
from the charge that he was reverting to
the mysticism of the worst Italians what
he argued was that his principles were
not occult only their causes were a cult
so in his words to derive general
principles inductively from phenomena
and afterwards to tell to tell us how
the properties of actions of all
corporeal things follow from these
manifest principles would be a very
great step in philosophy of science
though the causes of the principles were
not yet discovered and by the phrase not
yet discovered Newton the word yet is
crucial Newton was expressing his hope
that the causes would someday be
discovered in physical terms meaning
mechanical terms that was a hope that
lasted right through the 19th century
was finally dashed by 20th century
science so that hope is gone the model
of intelligibility that reigned from
Galileo through Newton and he well
beyond has a corollary when mechanism
fails understanding fails so Newton's
absurdities were finally over time just
incorporated into a common sense Natural
Science study them in school today
but that's quite different from common
sense understanding so to put it
differently one long-term consequence of
the Newtonian revolution was to lower
the standards of intelligibility for
natural science there's the hope to
understand the world which did animate
the modern scientific revolution that
was finally abandoned it was replaced by
a very different and far less demanding
goal namely to develop intelligible
theories of the world so as such further
absurdities as say curved space-time or
quantum indeterminacy were absorbed into
the natural sciences the very idea of an
intelligible of intelligibility is dis
does itself absurd for example by
Bertrand Russell who knew the science is
very well by the late 1920s he
repeatedly praised it places the word
intelligible in quotes to highlight the
absurdity of the quest and he dismisses
the qualms of the founders the great
founders of the Scientific Revolution
and Newton others dismisses them as
their qualms about action at a distance
he dismisses these as little more than a
prejudice although a more sympathetic
and I think accurate description would
be that they simply had higher standards
of intelligibility and if you look at
the work of leading physicists they more
or less say the same thing so a couple
of years after Russell wrote Paul Dirac
Rhoda well-known introduction to quantum
mechanics in which he says that physical
science no longer seeks to provide
pictures of how the world works that is
a model functioning on essentially
classical lines but only seeks to
provide a way of looking at the
fundamental laws which makes their
self-consistency obvious so we
understand the theories we've given up
trying to understand the world he was
referring of course to the inconceivable
collusions conclusions of quantum
physics but if modern thinkers hadn't
forgotten the past he could just as well
have been referring to the classical
Newtonian models and which were
undermined by Newton undermining the
hope of rendering natural phenomena
intelligible that was the primary goal
the animating spirit of the early
scientific revolution there's a classic
nineteenth-century history of
materialism by Friedrich longa
translated in English an introduction by
Russell longa observes that we have so
accustomed ourselves to the abstract
notion of forces or rather to a notion
hovering and a mystic
obscurity between abstraction and
concrete comprehension that we no longer
find any difficulty in making one
particle of matter act upon another
without immediate contact through void
space without a material link from such
ideas the great mathematicians and
physicists of the 17th century were far
removed they were genuine materialists
they insisted that contact mediate
contact as a condition of influence this
transition he says was one of the most
important turning points in the whole
history of materialism deprived the
notion of much significance if any at
all and with materialism goes the notion
of physical of body other counterparts
they have no longer any significance and
he adds that what Newton held to be such
a great absurdity that no philosophic
thinker could light upon it is prized by
posterity as Newton's great discovery of
the harmony of the universe those
conclusions are quite commonplace in
history of science so 50 years ago
Alexander quarreied another great
historian of science and scientists
observed that despite his unwillingness
to accept the conclusion Newton had
demonstrated that a purely materialistic
pattern of nature is utterly impossible
and a purely materialistic or
mechanistic physics as well his
mathematical physics required the
admission into the body of science of
incomprehensible and inexplicable facts
imposed on us by empiricism that is by
what we conclude from observations
despite these this recognition the
debates did not end so about a century
ago Boltzmann's a molecular theory of
gases or kick relays structural
chemistry in fact even Bohr's atom ones
you will learn in school these were only
given an instrument
interpretation modern history of
chemistry standard history points out
that they were regarded as calculating
devices but with no physical reality and
Newton's belief that the causes of his
principles were not yet discovered
implying that they would be it was
echoed it was echoed by for example by
Bertrand Russell in 1927 he wrote that
chemical laws cannot at present be
reduced the physical laws much like
Newton he hoped it would happen an
expected that it would but that
expectation also proved to be vain as
vain as Newton's shortly after Russell
wrote this it was shown that chemical
laws will never be reduced to physical
laws because the conception of physical
laws was erroneous finally done and
Linus Pauling's the quantum theoretic
account of the chemical bond shortly but
very much as in Newton's day the
perceived explanatory gap as it's now
called by philosophers that was never
filled today interestingly just few
years ago we read of the thesis of the
new biology that things mental indeed
minds are emergent properties of brains
though these emergencies are emergencies
are produced by principles that we do
not yet understand
that's a neuroscientist Vernon Mount
Castle he's formulating the guiding
theme of a collection of essays
reviewing the results of what was called
the decade of the brain last decade of
20th century
his phrase we do not yet understand
might very well suffer the same fate as
Russell's similar comment about
chemistry seventy years earlier or for
that matter Newton's much earlier one
in fact in many ways today's theory of
mind I think is recapitulating errors
that were exposed in the 1930s with
regard to chemistry and centuries before
that with regard to core physics though
in that case leaving us with a mystery
that may be a permanent one for humans
as humid actually asserted throughout
all this and today as well we can
optimistically look forward to
unification of some kind but not
necessarily reduction which is something
quite different
talk about reductionism is highly
misleading it's been abandoned over and
over again in the history of science
seeking unification much weaker goal
sometimes in the case of classic case of
Newton and what he left veiled in
mystery
that's may involve a significant
lowering of expectations and standards
well let me go back to the beginning the
exuberant thesis that the early
Scientific Revolution provided humans
with limitless explanatory power if we
look over the history I think quite
different conclusion is in order the
founders of the Scientific Revolution
were compelled by their discoveries to
recognize that human explanatory power
is not only not limitless but does not
even reach to the most elementary
phenomena of the natural world
that's masked by lowering the criteria
of intelligibility of understanding well
according if we accept that much as I
think we should a less ambitious
question arises the goals of science
having been lowered to finding
intelligible theories weaken sensibly
can we sensibly maintain we can ask this
can we sensibly maintain that humanly
accessible theories are limitless in
their explanatory scope so much weaker
goal
and furthermore does the theory of
evolution establish the limitless reach
of human cognitive can disseminate sense
actually think about it the opposite
conclusion seems much more reasonable
the theory of evolution of course places
humans firmly within the natural world
it regards humans as biological
organisms is very much like others and
for every such organism its capacities
have scope and limits to go together
that includes the cognitive domain so
rats for example I can't solve for say a
prime number maze that's because they
lack the appropriate concepts it's not
lack of memory or anything like that
they just don't have the concepts so for
rats we can make a useful distinction
between problems and mysteries problems
are tasks that lie within their
cognitive reach in principle mysteries
are ones that don't mysteries for rats
then may not be mysteries for us if
humans are not angels if we're part of
the organic world then human cognitive
capacity is also going to have scope and
limits so accordingly the distinction
between problems and mysteries holds for
humans and it's a task for science to
delimit it maybe we can maybe we can't
but at least it's a formula will test
and not inconsistent it's not
inconsistent to think that we might be
able to discover the limits of our
cognitive capacities therefore those who
accept modern biology should all be
mysterion's instead of ridiculing it
because mysterion ISM follows directly
from the theory of evolution everything
we believe about scientifically believe
about humans so the common ridicule of
this concept right through philosophy of
mind
at what it amounts to is the claim that
somehow humans are angels exempt from
biological constraints
and in fact far from be whaling the
existence of mysteries for humans that
we should be extremely grateful for it
because if there are no limits to what
we might call say the science forming
capacity it would also have no scope
just as if the genetic endowment imposed
no constraints on growth it would mean
that we could be at most some shapeless
amoeboid creature reflecting accidents
of an unanalyzed environment the
conditions that prevent a human embryo
from becoming saya insect or a chicken
those very same conditions play a
critical role in determining that the
embryo can become a human can't have one
without the other and the same holds in
the cognitive domain actually classical
aesthetic theory recognized that
recognize that there's a relation
between scope and limits without any
rules there can be no genuine creative
activity and that's even the case when
creative work challenges and revises
prevailing rules so far from
establishing the limitless scope of
human cognitive capacities a modern
evolutionary theory and in fact all
standard science undermines that hope
now that was actually appreciated right
away when the power of the theory of
evolution came to be recognized one
enlightening cases Charles Sanders purse
and his inquiry into what he called
abduction which is rather different from
the way the term is used today purse was
struck particularly by striking fact
that in the history of science that
major discoveries are often made
independently and almost simultaneously
which suggests that some principle is
directing inquiring minds towards that
goal under the existing circumstances of
understanding
and something similar is true for early
childhood learning so if you put aside
the pathology or pathology or extreme
deprivation that children are
essentially uniform in this capacity and
they uniformly make quite astounding
discoveries about the world going well
beyond what any kind of data analysis
could have could yield in the case of
language now known that that's starts
even before birth so child is born with
some conception of what counts as a
language and can even recognize its
mother's language is distinct from
another language both spoken by a
bilingual woman who's never heard before
this interesting distinctions
determining how it works but can be done
at birth and in fact even the first step
of language acquisition which is
generally searches taken for granted
it's quite a remarkable achievement an
infant has to select from the
environment from what William James
called the blooming buzzing confusion
the infant has to somehow select the
data that are language related it's a
task that's a total mystery for any
other organism they have absolutely no
way of doing it but it's a reflexively
solved problem for human infants and so
the story continues all the way to the
outer reaches of scientific discovery
well and it may not be continuous I'm
not suggesting that there's probably
different capacities involved rather
like Hume that purse concluded that
humans must have what he called an
abductive instinct which provides a
limit on admissible hypotheses so that
only certain explanatory schemes can be
entertained but not infinitely many
others all compatible with available
data purse argued that this instinct
develops through natural selection that
is the variants that yield truths about
the world provide a selectional
advantage
and are retained through descent with
modification Darwin's notions while
others fall away that belief is
completely unsustainable takes only a
moment to show that that can't be true
and if you drop it as we must we're left
with a serious and challenging
scientific problem namely determine the
innate components of our cognitive
nature those that are employed in
reflexive identification of language
relevant data or in other cognitive
domains take one famous case the
capacity of humans which is quite
remarkable - if presented with a
sequence of two Kista scopic
presentations just dots on a screen
three dots on a screen presented with a
sequence of these what you perceive is a
rigid object in motion some of the
cognitive principles are known but not
the neural basis for or for example
discovering and comprehending Newton's
laws or developing string theory or
solving problems of quantum entanglement
or as complex as you like and there is a
further task that's to determine the
scope and limits of human understanding
incidentally some differently structured
organism some Martian say might regard
human mysteries as simple problems and
might wonder that we can't find the
answers or even ask the right questions
just as we wonder about the inability of
rats to run prime number of mazes it's
not because of limits of memory or other
superficial constraints but because of
the very design of our cognitive nature
and their cognitive nature so actually
if you think it through I think it's
quite clear that the Newton's remarkable
achievements led to a significant
lowering of the expectations of science
a severe restriction on the role of
intelligibility they furthermore
demonstrated that it's an error to
ridicule
what's called the ghost in the machine
that's what I and others were taught at
your age and the best graduate schools
Harvard in my case but that's just a
mistake Newton did not exorcise the
ghosts rather he exercised the machine
he left the ghost completely intact and
by so doing he inadvertently set the
study of mind on a quite a new course
that made it possible to integrate it
into the sciences and Newton may very
well have realized this throughout his
life he struggled the later life
struggled vainly of course with the
paradoxes and conundrums that he
followed from his theory and he
speculated that what he called spirit
which he couldn't identify but whatever
it is might be the cause of all movement
in nature including the power of moving
our body by our thoughts and the same
power within other living creatures
though how this is done and by what laws
that we do not know that we cannot say
he concluded that all nature is not
alive going a step beyond Newton the
Locke suggested Locke added that we
cannot say that matter does not think
that's a speculation that's called Locke
suggestion in history philosophy so as
Locke put it it just has God had added
to motion inconceivable effects it is
not much more remote from our
comprehension to conceive that God can
if he pleases
super add to matter the Faculty of
thinking locked found this view
repugnant to the idea of senseless
matter but he said that we cannot reject
it because of our incurable ignorance
and the limits of our ideas that is our
cognitive capacities having no
intelligible concept of matter or
or physical as we still don't
incidentally but having no such concept
we he said we cannot dismiss the
possibility of living or thinking matter
particularly after Newton had undermine
totally undermined common sense
understanding permanently lock
suggestion was understood and it was
taken up right through the night the
18th century a human concluded that
motion may be and actually is the cause
of our thought and perception others
argued that since thought which is
produced in the brain cannot exist if
this organ is wanting and since there's
no reason any longer to question the
existence of thinking matter it's
necessary to conclude that the brain is
a special organ designed to produce
thought that much as the stomach and the
intestines are designed to operate the
digestion the liver to filter bile and
so on through the bodily organs so just
as foods enter the stomach and leave it
with new qualities so impressions arrive
at the brain through the nerves and are
then isolated they arrive isolated and
without any coherence but the organ the
brain enters into action it acts on them
it sends them back changed into ideas
which the language of physiognomies and
gesture or the signs of speech and
writing manifest outwardly I'm still
quoting we conclude then with the same
certainty that the brain digests as it
were the impressions that that is
organically it makes the secretion of
thought just as the liver secretes bile
Darwin put the matter who agreed with
this but the matter succinctly he asked
rhetorically why is thought being a
secretion of the brain more wonderful
than gravity a property of matter a
property that we
understand but we just came to accept
its therefore rather odd to read today
what I quoted before the leading thesis
of the decade of the brand that ended
the last century namely that things
mental indeed Minds are emergent
properties of brains mount castle
summary strange to read that because it
was commonplace in the 18th century so
it's not clear why it's an emerging
thesis and it's many other prominent
scientists and philosophers have
presented essentially the same thesis as
quotes and contemporary examples and
astonishing hypothesis of the new
biology of radical new idea in the
philosophy of mind the bold assertion
that mental phenomena are entirely
natural and caused by the
neurophysiological activities of the
brain opening the door to a novel
promising inquiries a rejection of
Cartesian mind-body dualism and so on
all of these reiterate in virtually the
same words formulations of centuries ago
the traditional mind-body problem having
become unfor malleable with the
disappearance of the only coherent
notion of body again physical material
and so on and so for example Joseph
Priestley's conclusion 18th century that
properties termed mental reduce somehow
to the organical structure of the brain
ID ingenuity which he developed in quite
interesting ways an idea which was
stated in different words less detailed
by Hume Darwin many others and almost
inescapable it would seem after the
collapse of the mechanical philosophy
well with the belated revival of ideas
that were reasonably well understood
centuries ago and our direct conclusions
of Newton's discoveries we're left with
scientific problems about the theory of
mind they can be pursued in many
like other questions of science maybe
with an eye to eventual unification
whatever form it may take
if any that enterprise renews a task
that Hume understood quite well he
called it the investigation of the
science of human nature the search for
the secret Springs and principles by
which the human mind is actuated in its
operations including those parts of our
knowledge that are derived from the
original hand of nature so what we would
call genetic endowment I'm another human
core tsa's you know the arch empiricist
but also a dedicated nativist supposed
to be the opposite of empiricism and he
had to be because he was reasonable the
that this inquiry which Hume compared in
principle to Newton's I had in fact been
undertaken in quite sophisticated ways
by English neoplatonist and work that
directly influenced Kant in there's a
contemporary in contemporary literature
there are their names for this and
sometimes called naturalization of
philosophy or epistemology naturalized
or sometimes just cognitive science but
in fact it's the direct consequence of
Newton's a demolition of the idea of
grasping the nature of the world and
inescapable so let me just summarize
briefly I think it's fair to conclude
that the hopes and expectations of the
early Scientific Revolution were dashed
by Newton's discoveries which leaves us
with several conclusions one conclusion
actually reinforced by Darwin is that
while our cognitive capacities may be
vast and scoped they are nonetheless
intrinsically limited some questions
that we might like to explore may well
beyond lie beyond our cognitive reach
that we may not even be able to
formulate the right questions the
standards of success may have to be
lowered
once again as has happened before they
vary dramatically with the collapse of
the mechanical philosophy and another
conclusion is that the mind-body problem
can safely be put to rest since there is
no coherent alternative to Locke's
suggestion and if we adopt Locke
suggestion that opens the way to the
study of mind as a branch of biology
much like the study of the rest of the
body on the body below the neck could
get metaphorically a great deal has been
learned in the past half century of
revival of traditional concerns of the
early Scientific Revolution and the
Enlightenment but many of the early
leading questions have not been answered
and may never be
thank you very much we're going to open
for questions and comments right away I
have a question about mind body you just
ended year with like maybe we should
just forget that dilemma and my question
to you is if you have thought about
instead of a well instead of
just to forget it and put it in a
bracket and then we can just add another
factor mind body and the senses and see
what happens and I my question to you is
have you have anything to say about that
combination mind body in the senses yes
well mind body is meaningless if there's
no body there's no mind body problem
and there hasn't been any concept of
bodies in student I mean Newton still
thought that was there was one but as he
put it we haven't yet discovered it
meaning accounted for it in mechanical
terms but that's been given up certainly
by the 20th century so there is no
concept of physical the term physical is
just kind of like an honorific word kind
of like the word real when we say the
real truth it doesn't add anything it
just is what a serious truth so to say
that something physical today just means
you got to take it seriously but there's
no further concept of physical or
material or body so there can't be a
mind-body problem it son for me label
there's a lot of work you find plenty of
articles on the mind-body problem oh
that's funny I follow that 12f that's
one that I understand yeah but what
about senses yeah thank you added that's
senses are part of the body
no we if you okay I'm so and we all
agree yeah
this some way in which external the
external world impinges on an organism
and the way that happens is what we call
the senses we have different senses from
other organisms like you know there are
other working as as much smarter than us
they can see ultraviolet light hear
things we can't hear and so on but we
all have our scope and limit with senses
too is that that we there was some kind
of reduction of expectations of what an
explanation should be when it was no
more mechanical and not necessarily
mechanical understandable and I wonder
the relation between mechanical and
material and yeah and also I I've just
been to conference on Gregory Bateson
and he's easy very into this idea of a
information being a difference that
makes a difference and he says that a
difference is intrinsically non material
so the cybernetic causalities they are
non material but still mechanical and
then I wonder what is the relation
between mechanical and material and
could there be some of the problem well
there can't be a relation because
there's no such thing as material that's
like saying what's the relation between
information and ectoplasm you can't ask
that question till you tell us what
ectoplasm is and nobody can tell us what
material is actually when you look at
modern physics you have some pretty
interesting proposals there's a book I
don't pretend to understand it but
published by the American Physical
Society so I guess it's taken seriously
by a very well-known physicist I think
he died recently a physicist at the
Institute for Advanced Study John
Wheeler who argues that the only thing
that exists in the world are bits of
information namely answers to questions
that we pose to nature that's all there
is
everything else is some kind of
construct for those so you know from
that point of view all there is is
information you know it's apparently not
ridiculed by physicists
so I'm not able to ridicule and I
understand what he means at what he's
talking from the framework of quantum
theory which says this what's there is
our observations the questions we posed
to nature and the answers it gives back
to us and those are just bits of
information
everything else is constructed from that
it's a little bit like say Eddington and
Russell you know early twenties saying
that all that really exists is meter
readings and everything else is our
construction for meter readings
so if physicists had the same illusions
as psychologists they were in
sociologists and others they might call
physics meter reading science the way
modern study of society and action is
sometimes is often called behavioral
science it's confusing the topic with
the data for it some of the data yeah
you were talking about the limits of
understanding a little bit and I was
watching a clip on YouTube I believe it
was in 1971 and you were debating with
the French philosopher which is Foucault
I believe I don't remember
Michel Foucault and you were debating
about or his arguments were more I guess
that the social limits that we impose
ourselves are something that needs to be
taught and needs to be enforced well you
were trying to say that it was something
inherently in the human mind to have
kindness and intelligence in order to be
like social my question is what what do
you think it's our limits for or to be
able to go in peace in a social contest
and and start struggling I believe in
evolution so I think that it's an
evolution thing but I think your
philosophers are trying very very hard
to develop or to understand in order to
be more social and peacefully creatures
not just philosophers all of us are in
our ordinary lives raising children
whatever it may be there's no real
debate between I mean the debate was not
about the importance of social factors
of course they exist
the debate was about what has taken to
be contentious but shouldn't be the
existence of innate factors that's very
commonly denied and Foucault in fact was
denying it but it's just incoherent to
deny it if you deny it then our
cognitive and social behavior would be
like some imagined organism if you can
imagine one that doesn't have any
genetic program that determines what
kind of organism it will be and nothing
that determines that will be an insect
or a mouse or a human or whatever and it
therefore will be nothing it will be
some amoeboid style reflection of
accidental data a lot of scientists have
argued that philosophers too so Quine
for example famously I would say
infamously argue that language but it
would hold free yelled it for all
behavior in fact all theories is just
the result of some it's a kind of an
accidental collection of behaviors they
constructed by develop through
conditioning I mean that's essentially
like saying we're all amoebas amoeboid
not even an amoeba because an amoeba has
internal structure it doesn't doesn't it
doesn't make any sense you can't have
any structure in an organism unless
there's some form of predetermination
that form of predetermination will
provide scope it will also impose limits
and there's just no way out of that
that's practically logic but yes to try
to become more humane creatures is not
just philosophers quest it should be
quest for all of us what are the
determination what are the historical or
scientifical factors determining the
scope of our understanding and can we
assume that the scope of our
understanding have progressed since say
the act and
well as far as we know human cognitive
capacities have not changed for at least
50,000 years
when humans are some small group of
hunter-gatherers left Africa and spread
all over the world where all their
descendants I mean maybe a little more
complex than that but not a lot more now
we know that pretty well certain moments
is like you know it's not that anyone
understands the biological nature of it
but there's very strong evidence so for
example if you take an infant from some
tribe in Papua New Guinea that hasn't
had other human contact for 40,000 years
and that's a possibility and you take
that infant and you bring it to Oslo and
raise it from infancy in Oslo it will be
indistinguishable from the people
studying physics and Oslo University it
has the same cognitive capacities and
conversely you take a you know an infant
from here and put it in that drive in
Papua New Guinea it will be able to do
all the complex cognitive tasks that
they can solve but that you and I
couldn't possibly solve we couldn't
survive there for a week so it looks
from evidence less young from evidence
like that which is maybe not conclusive
but is certainly powerful it seems that
cognitive capacities just haven't
changed in fact humans are genetically
very much alike as compared with other
species natl and it's not surprising
because there's apparently a common
origin not very long ago the 50,000
years is nothing in evolutionary time
that's a live link so chances are that
whatever the cognitive capacities were
50,000 years ago they still are of
course they have to be brought out like
like other innate capacities they have
to be elicited by experience but they're
there you know and I think that's you
know him wasn't thinking about evolution
of course but when he talked about the
common faculties that are
given by the original hand of nature I
think must be what he meant these were
real problems in the 17th and 18th
century remember that at the time of the
early Scientific Revolution that was
also the time of the first real
explorations and explorers were finding
all sorts of creatures that didn't look
like Europeans like Negroes and
orangutan and so on and they weren't
sure how to distinguish them so which
ones are some of them human or not if
you if you're a Cartesian rationalist
there's a sharp distinction between
human and non-human Cartesian
rationalism is incompatible with racism
so a point that historian philosophy
Howard Harold Harry Bracken has
discussed at length you can't be a
rationalist and a racist you either have
a mind or you don't have a mind and if
you have a mind it's the same there's
only one you know so that's it you can't
empiricists on the other hand could be
racist because there's no there's you
can have different properties and these
were hotly debated issues in the 17th
and 18th century they couldn't figure
out what those other creatures were were
the humans or weren't they if they were
did they have rights and if so what
rights and so on but of course that's
long past that now there's just humans
were apparently essentially all alike
and what we could there could be a study
of what our common cognitive capacities
are in fact it's studied quite a lot so
when you study what the way say infants
determine continue the continuity of
objects on the basis of very scattered
data you're essentially asking the kinds
of questions that Descartes asked the
court actually people own you know
unfortunately philosophers these days
tend only to read the meditations but
that's
Descartes in fact that was kind of
propaganda even pointed that alle P the
famous letter he wrote to his friend
Marcin where he said that the point of
the meditations is to try to convince
the Jesuits to take his physic seriously
that's what he really cared about when
he wrote principles of philosophy that
means principles of science that's the
real stuff and in that work and in the
optics and other things he posed very
interesting questions he didn't carry
out the experiments but he carried out
thought experiments very much the way
Galileo did and but there she carried
him out they'd probably come out his way
so like when one was to ask the question
I said imagine an infant who has had no
experience with geometrical figures okay
which in fact is every infant because
geometrical figures don't exist in
nature just some other things but so
take an infant with no experience with
geometrical figures present that infant
with a triangle drawn on paper is that
what the infant will perceive is a
distorted triangle not a perfect
instance of whatever crazy figure it is
you know with the two lines not quite
coming together one of them somewhat
curved and so on and he regarded that as
kind of paradoxical why should that be
true and if you're a thoroughgoing and
period empiricist you shouldn't permit
that conclusion in fact it's a sense the
conclusion is almost certainly correct
it's a easy refutation of standard
empiricism and his conclusion de cartes
conclusion was well we must have some
innate system of he was some Euclidian
geometry which we impose on data to
yield our understanding in fact our
perception and there's quite a lot of
work in the speculation and through the
18th and 17th century on how this could
be in basic ideas are probably correct
there's no a lot of experimental work
and
with infants and comparative work
investigating it and that is at the
beginnings of work trying to find out
what our cognitive capacities are
there's also work on something like
rudimentary science forming how do
children develop a concept that the
world lacks some rational fashion a lot
of this developed out of PJ's work even
though doesn't stand up as it he
presented it that kind of work has been
pursued and that is I think the study of
what you're asking how far it can go
how can it go up to what kind of
scientific theories we can understand
that's far off if we no longer consider
materialism as relevant but still we
want to do philosophy there should be an
endeavor there should be a point and
what should the endeavor of philosophy
be then if it is it pure consciousness
is that what we are exploring and and if
so how do we go about to explore those
limits of knowledge and and how do we
practically do that because many people
propose for instance that they can use
psychedelic substances and so are there
some taboos that are stopping us from
making that research that would be
leaving materialism behind and moving on
forward considering different aspects of
our experience or whatever I'm not
forgetting that right well I don't think
we can leave materialism behind until
somebody tells us what materialism is
that's kind of elementary there was a
concept of materialism right through the
early Scientific Revolution right
through Newton Newton still accepted it
in fact the great scientists of the next
century accepted it you know lagron
others kept trying to develop a material
mechanistic concept of the universe
that went right through the
nineteenth-century ether theories and so
on it was finally given up in the 20th
century you know finally recognized like
we're never going to get it and totally
different ways of looking at things were
developed which have no relation to
traditional materialism and Friedrich
longest correct
so since and nobody's ever suggested
another notion it materialism just is
like anything we more or less understand
it includes thinking it includes
reasoning and so on and so forth
Locke suggestion so we can't leave it
behind unless someone tells it what it
is but there's no reason why we can we
can't study it and we can study what the
human capacity of understanding is in
fact we know some things about it we
know some negative things for example we
can't understand the way the world works
because our concept of understanding is
too limited to incorporate what Newton
described as an absurdity you know
people like Newton and Hume and Locke
were not idiots
I think I'm seriously they regarded it
as an absurdity for very good reasons
and modern cognitive science which
somehow tries to recapitulate some of
this finds pretty much that so as I
mentioned an infant presented with
presentations which indicate that
there's some kind of causality like you
know when the ball rolls this way light
turns red or something they will invent
a mechanical cause and they don't care
if it's not visible because infants
understand that most of what goes on is
invisible you know but there's got to be
some mechanical cause otherwise the way
for it to influence anything else so
that does seem to be the way our minds
work and that tells us something about
the limits of our understanding in fact
a classical crucial case and it can go
on to other cases so and when we can't
study it directly in principle we can
study it directly it's not simple and
it's not easy to understand why a rat
can't understand can't deal with the
prime number may
even that's hard and we have good
evidence that's true but why it's true
is unclear nothing known about the
brains of rats that explains why they
can't do that if I we can explain why
say the tiniest organism that seriously
studied C elegans nematodes that eight
hundred cells three hundred neurons
entire wiring diagram known live in
years of study trying to explain why
this thing it goes left instead of right
let's say it's just we don't know how to
explain that it's there's an answer but
that these are hard scientific questions
when you talk about how human
intelligence works it's incomparably
more difficult so you can you can ask
the questions you can you know cut away
at them but we shouldn't we shouldn't
exaggerate its kind of striking that
going back to what philosophy owe to
duel philosophers often appear to intend
to want to get answers about humans that
we can't get about insects and that's
too much you know science sort of works
at the edges of understanding and it
faces hard questions all the way so we
can sort of talk about it but if you
want to seriously work on it you have to
take a look at what is understood and
trust even formulate questions which
will which are can be investigated and
will tell us more about what's
understood actually is interesting work
going on on this having to do with
things like mark the human moral
instinct in the past twenty thirty years
that's become an experimental subject
with interesting experimental work on
universal probably universal moral
principles a very important book just
came out a couple of weeks ago by John
McKay oh he's a philosophers now teaches
law at Georgetown University who is a
very acute he more or less initiated
this modern study didn't publish much
but other people of drawing off his
a combination of reanalysis of
traditional moral philosophy may lead
roles and is antecedents and an analysis
a lot of the critique of roles and and
then on to developing experimental
programs to investigate some of these
questions and it's feasible maybe we can
get some insight into in a human and
moral concepts that are that are
cross-cultural like you're going to find
them at every culture and that you can
find with young children the pre any
serious cultural impact those are all
things that can be studied and there's
beginnings of studies I was wondering
what do you think about the prospects of
genetic engineering and how that might
perhaps expand our cognitive abilities
and thereby maybe also expanding the
scope of what we're able to understand
well in order to carry out genetic
engineering you have to understand
something about the genetics of the
traits that you're trying to deal with
so if you know Monsanto wants to
genetically engineer and say rice that
will be immune to some kind of disease
they have to understand something about
what in the genetics of rice yields the
you know the susceptibility of disease
when we talk about human understanding
we have no clue at the genetics or so
you just can't even begin to ask a
question I mean that raises the question
should we even try if we did know but
that ethical question is pretty far off
in the distance because the genetics of
it aren't understood I mean my own
professional work is mostly on language
and even in the case of language which
is a small part of our cognitive
capacity a kind of a central part for a
small part and there is any idea with
very little idea with the genetics or
it's obviously there and you can see its
consequences but to try to find it it's
very hard
and as I said questions like that are
not easy to answer about insects or tiny
worms would you say that the search for
deep so-called particles carriers of
influence like the Higgs boson and the
photon is that a search for a path back
to contact action and therefore
mechanical philosophy I'm sure I'd
inertia for the photons ever tried to
the potato sort of contact the photon
Folio the Higgs boson well you know
there's a slight problem in physics they
can't find 90% of what the universe is
made up of but you know doesn't mean an
end to physics you just look harder and
what they're searching for is the Higgs
boson which is supposed to be there and
if it is there it can account for why
particles have mass other words energy
otherwise just can't account for it I'm
going to just assume either it's there
or something different from the standard
models correct but you know until it's
found
you can't ask whether you can't say
whether it exists or whether the
standard model that presupposes it is
wrong that's a very life question
they're spending billions of dollars
trying to answer it in Switzerland
CERN things like United States instantly
it's given up on that quest
Congress won't fund it hi I'm my name is
timothy chen i'm a postdoc here at CSM
bad ok yes ok so I'm professor Tom
schedule you mentioned that you fought
is legitimate scientific project to
investigate go where the limits of human
understanding lies
so whether question is beyond our
ability to answer I just wonder what
what kind of evidence or inquiry do you
think would be relevant to that so
so so just an example you know in
philosophy call him again host the wheel
that the nature of consciousness or the
explanatory craft that's something that
you human beings are just never going to
be able to answer and I guess there's
some some affinity between his position
and what you say but then an objection
to him that I'm sympathetic to you said
well how do you know we cannot know how
do you know that if you give human
beings with 10,000 years or support we
suppose that we haven't gone extinct by
that how do you know that you give
10,000 years people are going to come up
with new concepts that they don't now
have so how do you know that they are
not going to be able to solve it so so I
just wonder you keep you fake you think
there's a scientific evidence for these
questions well comp evidence would that
be well first of all we're talking about
empirical questions and in the case of
empirical questions you never know with
certainty that's what makes some
empirical questions otherwise they'd be
questions of logic or maybe arithmetic
and even there you can ask questions but
if it's empirical we were never going to
know with certainty that's for sure
that's true by definition so the
question really is what evidence do we
have and how good is the evidence well
in some cases the evidence is pretty
good like take the classical case what
Newton regarded as an absurdity and
again I think have take people like
Newton seriously you know and Hume and
the Huygens and the rest of them what
they regard it as an absurdity is that
there could be influence without contact
and I well we don't know with certainty
that that's the limits of human
intelligence there's pretty good
evidence if you study first of all we
just have it from our own intuitions and
from you know the history of centuries
of efforts by the leading scientists to
try to do --scent to overcome it finally
ending in failure
abandoning the quest and we also know it
are beginning to understand it from just
the experimental study of infants
children things of the kind that I
mentioned they reflexively seek some
kind of contact in order to account for
correlations than make sense otherwise
office visits are finally given that up
they said look we're never going to find
it it doesn't exist but is it how strong
is that evidence well you decide how
strong it is
looks pretty compelling to me and if it
is really the limits of our
understanding then nothing's going to
change in 10,000 years that just as it
didn't change in the last 50,000 what
about things beyond that well you know
it's not an easy question to ask even
about other creatures like rats but you
can investigate it
are you ever going to get certainty no
you'll never have certainty because it's
an empirical investigation so that you
no bother looking for as far as
consciousness is concerned I was very
hot topic these days in fact in
philosophy it's called the hard problem
everything else is an easy problem
something but this is the hard problem
now you go back to the 17th and 18th
century they also had something called a
heart problem namely how is motion
possible that was the hard problem I
mentioned you know Newton wrestled with
it finally said it's impossible I'll
just have to accept even though we can't
find difficult a physical cause that was
called the hard rock and philosophy
Voltaire you know dedicated Newtonian I
said that the fact that humans can cause
motion by thought and like I can think I
want my hand to go over here and
something will move
he said that's so inexplicable that it's
got to be divine intervention he was of
course a pretty dedicated atheist by the
standards at the time but it looks as if
we're stuck with that
and there seemed to be if we look
further there are many other many other
things oh he takes a language which is
easier study there are impossible
languages you can construct things you
know things that look symbol sequences
which are given interpretations and so
on but which have a structure that
humans cannot learn I mean they may deal
with it as a puzzle of some kind but
they can't deal with it as a linguistic
task
there's by now pretty good experimental
data on that well that's the kind of
thing you expect to find when you look
at any organism including our cognate
other cognitive capacities as far as
consciousness is concerned you know I'm
not so convinced that it's the hard
problem first of all you have to
formulate it coherently what's the
problem I mean I quoted Francis Crick I
didn't mention him as saying that he has
an astonishing hypothesis that
consciousness comes from activity of the
brain that's lot you know Hume I mean
yes they took that for granted so that's
the astonishing hypothesis and then you
can go to proceed as he and others have
done to ask what's going on in the brain
when people are conscious okay that's
serious work does it answer them suppose
you could get all those questions
answered does it tell you what
consciousness is no leaves open the
questions of consciousness and in fact
you know we might ultimately be reduced
to something like what Bertrand Russell
thought it read his analysis of matter
for example which unfortunately isn't
read much but it's important I think I
think it's 1928 or so he says he says
look the only thing we have any
confidence in is our immediate
consciousness and we may be wrong about
it but at least we have some degree of
constant confidence in it everything
else is a metal isn't an intellectual
construction including our conception of
objects or theory the world and so on so
that's if you want the hard rock not too
hard because it could be wrong but
that's what we have to start with and
the best you can do is human okay your
political ideas and I they have a
foundation on ethics yeah a ethics
morality and then I want to ask you how
is morality compatible with a limited
limited mind better mind human as you
put it if I understood you well because
in limited mind and determine human I
don't see a place for the free will
which is the base of morality in the
human world so what you think about it
about free will and morality which is of
course the base of politics and social
yeah so human moral principles we can
study like the kind of work that I
mentioned John mikail
others are carrying out the beginnings
of experimental work which sheds light
on and may ultimately shed a lot of
light on what Aaron ate moral principles
are what Hume was looking for for
example Adam Smith and others that could
shed some light on it so I think it's
going to tell you much about freedom of
the will a freedom of the will I think
we're stuck pretty much where dick Hart
was we just can't abandon believing it
it's our most immediate
phenomenologically obvious impression
but we can't explain it and as he said
if there's something which we just know
to be true that we don't have any
explanation for it well too bad for our
explanatory possibilities but I don't
see any way of getting around that
there's a lot of arguments that we don't
have freedom of the will and those
arguments are there's a ton of
literature on there and the literature
is kind of interesting actually for
reasons that William James discussed
they said if you believe that there's no
freedom of the will why bother
presenting an argument
you're just you're forced to do it the
person you're talking to can't be
convinced because there's no such thing
as reasons so why not watch a baseball
game that wasn't his example but you
know anybody who denies freedom the will
actually believes that it's there
otherwise they wouldn't bother
presenting reasons I mean unless they
say look I'm just forced to present the
I can't do anything else but these
reasons yeah
and it's very very odd these discussions
many of them actually you may have seen
some experimental work which caused a
big flurry a couple of years ago some
neurophysiologists discovered that if a
person is going to carry and act the
willed action let's say you know pick
this up say there's you can find
activity in the motor centers of the
brain before there's a decision to pick
it up okay and that was held to show
okay we've undermined freedom of the
will it didn't say anything all it cell
says is what we ought to know anyway
decisions are mostly made unconsciously
by the time they reach the level of
consciousness they've probably already
been made but that doesn't tell anything
about how decisions are made but you
didn't answer me at least I didn't
realize I didn't egg I perceive that I
got an answer is it compatible you're
teaching about determined genetically
determined humans and ethics political
ethics morality we will that is what I
asked is it compatible or comparable
it's incompatible and unexplained you
said it's unexplainable I don't
understand why belief in certain ethical
principles should be inconsistent with
the belief that we have an ability to
make choices in fact they seem totally
consistent maybe it's all wrong but
they're consistent if somebody's
determined one cannot take a choice that
is that is the that's the base of
I didn't I don't understand what the
alleged inconsistent to use if over here
it's more like what you what I thought
you said before that immoral the
commitment tomorrow principles basically
presupposes freedom of the will but I
don't see any inconsistent she
attributed its some belief in genetic
determinism to you but you haven't
committed to anything like yeah genetic
there's genetic determinism of course
that's why I'm that's why we're all
humans and not insect because that's our
genetic endowment that's genetic
determinism just what follows from it
you know you have to look and see we
don't know
my question relates to the previous
question actually um free well you know
as a philosopher I'd like to pull you as
a philosopher I'd like to ask you this
question you know studies have shown
that decisions made in the brain
actually appear some moments before an
individual silentium um well how can you
then say that there is such a thing is
free will I mean thus wiring determinism
you know it proves that free will
basically doesn't exist those are the
experiments I was just referring to
there are some experiments which show
that in a willed action simple will that
motor action you know picking something
up there is activity and the relevant
parts of the motor cortex before the
decision to pick it up is conscious okay
that tells us absolutely nothing about
freedom of the will accept that
choices are probably unconscious but I
think we know that without the
experiment one complicated oh yeah
anything in this area
we understand nothing everything's
complicated yeah it's another truism you
do seem to imply that the theories of
physics and chemistry in some way
constructs of our imagination and I
wouldn't work very much okay to that but
you also seem to imply some that they
can be deconstructed in some way into in
biology they can be deconstructed into
the neurobiology of our brains but what
gives you the confidence that our
scientific method is scientists were I
was scientific method yes this method is
well what gives you enough confidence in
the scientific method to believe the
evidence that biology give gives others
that seems to be some innate skepticism
in that system of thought and me it's
all I would other ends up believing in
no no nothing at all not even that we do
not believe anything than actually
believing in our own limitations
so if we are so if we are so
fundamentally limited as you claimed we
are how can we have any confidence in
the evidences providing the fact that we
are limited a pure skeptic you can give
no answers to which means that they're
not asking sensible questions we're only
interested in sensible questions the
kind to which you can even imagine an
answer may be a wrong answer but if you
can't even imagine an answer it may have
the form of a question but it's not a
question like for example if you were to
ask why two things happen okay that
happens I've the structure of an
interrogative sentence but it has no
answers no even imaginable answers so
therefore it's not a question just as
the structure of an interrogative
the pure skeptic if one can be imagined
is posing things that look like
questions but aren't really as to how
you can have confidence first of all you
never have complete confidence if it's
if it's an empirical issue in fact you
know even even arithmetic you can't have
complete conscience come it's known you
know you can have non-standard models of
arithmetic which satisfy the axioms but
are different and so on so if it in
empirical questions you develop
consonant confidence from experience
intuition experiment and so on what's
called the scientific method but that's
a funny term because there really is
nothing that's the scientific method
like when you take say a psychology
course a program you do take a course in
methodology but when you study physics
you don't take a course in methodology
there's no method other than being
reasonable you know and learning from
what has been done and seeing if you
carry it forward and so on in fact the
courses in methodology that you take say
in psychology or sociology or our mostly
courses in statistics and think
techniques you can use but scientific
method is you know just whatever way we
have of dealing with the world
rationally reasonably can we have
confidence in it no maybe it's
misleading us just as rats are
consistently being misled about mazes we
can understand it for them but if that's
true all we can do is try to see if we
can use the same rational approaches to
see if we can figure out what the limits
of error intellectual capacities are and
we have some examples in which I think
can have fair confidence like the
collapse of the intuitive intuitively
obvious fact content interaction
requires contact I don't know much about
physics so I'm going to ask this like
simple simply and maybe you already
answered this and do you reject the
possibility of a non-physical reality
interacting with this physical reality
and you like acknowledge it the
possibility of it through seeing the
effects it might have on the physical
reality I'm thinking of like the study
of like the smallest entities of an atom
and um yeah and also just the power of
Attraction what is it well the two of us
share something I don't understand
physics either so that so we're in the
same but in fact I don't think
physicists understand it and I'm pretty
open about it but see you can't ask the
question about a interaction between
physical and non-physical until you tell
us what physical means okay if at least
got to be able to tell us what physical
means in order for the question to be
answered but there hasn't been any
concept of physical for hundreds of
years um there was one in the early
Scientific Revolution a very intuitive
concept of the physical that's what
inspired Galileo the cart Leibniz in
Newton the garage you know many others
all throughout the modern history of
science but it's been recognized but it
was already recognized after Newton that
it's gone like Locke recognized Hume
recognized for him it's already gone
it's a total mystery beyond our
intellectual capacities and that we can
speculate about but it's certainly gone
and no one has proposed anything else
the physical these days are things that
Newton would have regarded as total
absurdities like curved space-time how
can that be physical a quantum
entanglement I mean Einstein regarded
that as non-physical because it's so
absurd but you know now scientists just
accept it physical is just anything we
more or less understand and if that's
the only notion of physical we have
there can't be interaction between
physical and non-physical non-physical
be all the things just all the things we
don't understand if we ever get to
understand them
physical I think that they're getting
right close to six o'clock by hankie
