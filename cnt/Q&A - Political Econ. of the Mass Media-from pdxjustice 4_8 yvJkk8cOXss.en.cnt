Express that fact and I certainly don't
think that we should be deterred in
expressing this fact if other people
whose you know fascists whatever
happened to condemn the Soviet Union
just for the same reasons the Trotsky
mentioned in the 1930s getting back to
losing the forest for the trees do we
have part two of the book pulping story
please pardon part two of your book
pulping story you promised in question
answers might come up would you said you
had some further oh the aftermath of
that poping incident yeah is that what
you meant yes yeah well that that's kind
of a more subtle and complex which is
what I didn't talk about it but here's
what actually happened but we the book
was later decided to rewrite and update
it and we did and it came out from south
end press which was then in existence a
small radical press run but cooperative
run by a young people and it was
published as the political economy of
human rights a two-volume book that came
out in 1979 well South and press wasn't
going to pulp it so it exists in fact
you can even buy it now what happened at
that point you can't pulp the book any
longer so how do you react to it well
there are two ways of reacting to it the
main ways to ignore it there were a lot
of things in the book you can read it
and see what was there but for example
part there was a discussion of it was
discussion of u.s. foreign policy in the
media basically that's what it was and
the extensive case studies of both
topics and so on and so forth mostly it
was ignored as you'd predict but it
wasn't entirely ignored there was one
exception and a very interesting
exception let me give you the background
it explains some of the more subtle ways
in which the system works in this one of
the things we did in this in order to
put the propaganda model to a test we
didn't call it propaganda model then it
the same thing in order to put it to a
test we try to compare sort of paired
thora coincidence kind of like I was
doing in connection with freedom of
press issued fine I mean history doesn't
create exact controlled experiments but
there are enough cases that are similar
enough so you can test how the media are
going to deal with them when we looked
for such cases we particular we looked
for atrocities and we divided the
atrocities we looked at into three
categories what we called constructive
blood baths meaning ones that are good
for us power and the corporate class so
their constructive benign blood baths
one where us power and privilege doesn't
care very much one or another it's sort
of irrelevant and nefarious blood bets
those are the ones carried out by
official enemies so we had various types
of benign constructive in the various
blood beds and we gave quite a number of
examples of these well our prediction
was that the media would welcome the
constructive blood baths that they would
ignore the benign blood baths and that
they would become outraged over the
nefarious blood beth's and in fact in
the case of the nefarious bloodbath it
would invent all sorts of fantasies and
so on and so forth to make them look
even worse than they were that was the
prediction and we have a bunch of cases
and we showed that I think we tried to
show and I think did show that the
predictions were correct now there's
actually another prediction that comes
out of that model which we didn't make
but it's implicit if you think about it
and that has to do with the way that
this exposure will be responded to what
you'd predict if you think it through is
that our discussion of the constructive
blood baths would be ignored because to
reveal the fact that the media welcomed
huge blood baths as they did would not
be very conducive to the interests of
power or to the media it would also
expose the fraud about the the apparent
anger over nefarious blood bet so you'd
expect the constructive bloodbath to be
ignored as far as the benign blood
deaths are concerned you might expect an
occasional statement since it's over the
fact that the media ignored the benign
blood bath doesn't show to you no such
terrible things it doesn't listen
applaud them and as long as you can
exclude the role of the United States
and being
involved in them not terrible maybe a
few odd comments with regard to the
nefarious blood best what you'd expect
is fury and venom over the fact that the
media that the fabrications over
bloodbath of the enemy were exposed as a
fraud and that's important and that can
be used it can be used in fact to defame
the critics see if you show that people
are lying about the crimes of official
enemies that you can easily distort that
into a defense of those crimes right
like okay now what happened well let me
take two cases which were very close to
cases that we were that we discussed
were the slaughter and team were from
nineteen seventy five to nineteen
seventy-nine and the slaughter in
Cambodia from that in the same years
1975 279 we compared those two cases the
one in Timor we called a benign blood
bet the United States didn't care much
one way or the other so hundreds of
thousands of T Marie's get killed it's
not very interesting the case in
Cambodia was of course in nefarious
blood death that was the bad guys doing
and we gave a very detailed account of
what evidence was available about these
two they're in the same area of the
world the same years the same timeframe
the evidence available was comparable
the the slaughters were apparently
comparable in scale the one in Timor was
considerably greater relative to the
population but probably roughly
comparable in scale the difference was
that in Cambodia it was carried out by
the enemy Paul Pott whereas in Timor it
was carried out by a friend Indonesia
and furthermore it was carried out by
Indonesia with American arms which were
provided by the Carter Administration
which were expand these as the arms flow
was expanded by the Carter
Administration as the atrocities
increased well how did the media deal
with this first fact number we went
through this in detail the media dealt
with the team or blood baths by
suppressing there was considerable
coverage of Timor believe it or not in
1974 and 75 this was all in the context
of the breakup of the Portuguese Empire
in as the as Indonesia attack teamwork
and the massacre started with us support
coverage began to drop when the massacre
hit its peak in 1978 and it was really
approaching genocide with it with
increasing us support coverage dropped
to zero literally zero that's the way
they dealt with the team were massacred
what about the Cambodia massacre well
within weeks after the Khmer Rouge to
power they were already being accused of
genocide but New York Times about a year
later they were being accused of
carrying out auto genocide and of having
murdered two million people in fact even
if having boasted of having murdered two
million people that became the
conventional line there then came a huge
outcry ranging from The Reader's Digest
and TV Guide over to the new york review
of books and including just about
everything in between vasc outcry of
outrage over the Communist monsters who
were carrying out this horrifying
bloodbath and so on and so forth
interestingly in all of the there was a
tremendous amount of fabrication just
plain fabrication of evidence for
example that just give you one example
take this two million boast of two
million kill you know that's what
everybody's heard you ask people how
many people had Paul Pott killed by say
1977 they'll say two million here's
where it comes from in there was a book
published by a French priest Paul swap
on show as his name who's from Cambodia
he wasn't there then but he knew about
Cambodia he published a book in French
the book was of course not available in
English it was in French it was reviewed
by a French journalist journalist named
Jean loquitur was reviewed in France
that review was immediately picked up
and translated in the United States who
here in the New York Review of Books
that's a fastest translation of a review
of a French book that's ever appeared
but in in the review loquitur said this
he said according to Pancho the Khmer
Rouge boast of having murdered two
million people auto genocide horrifying
and so on and give a whole bunch of
quotes from the book about the
horrifying things the Khmer Rouge said
and so on and so forth that was
immediately picked up by the rest of the
media it was all over the place you know
news
her articles oh my god what they're
doing and so on and so forth well I was
curious at the time because that didn't
you know I didn't hadn't seen the
evidence about that I just want to know
what was going on so I the book was
unavailable so I wrote two friends in
France and asked them to send it to me
and I got the book and I probably was
the only person in the United States
would read it all there was being quoted
all over the place on the base of this
review and I quickly discovered that the
whole review was a total fraud whatever
was going on in Cambodia that's not what
the book said the book didn't say
anything about a boast of two million
people the quotes that were given in a
review he didn't peer in the book or
they may be he sort of figure out what
they were from was some wording a little
bit like them but they were grossly
distorted and some of them didn't even
weren't even quotes from the Khmer Rouge
they would quote from Ty and so on but
in fact every factual statement and the
in the review was just totally false
here's the way the two million figure
came Paul show in the book says that
about 800,000 people were killed in the
American War 70 to 75 meaning primarily
by American bombing and the word that
the United States ran from 70 to 75
that's 800,000 people he
