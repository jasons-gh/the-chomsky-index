the war and peace report
I'm Amy Goodman we continue our
conversation with Noam Chomsky Democracy
Now is nermeen Shaikh and I spoke to him
on November 1st it was just days after a
gunman shot dead 11 Jewish worshippers
October 27th at a synagogue in
Pittsburgh it was the deadliest
anti-semitic attack in US history
I asked known to talk about
anti-semitism and his own Jewish
upbringing in Philadelphia Pennsylvania
his father was a Hebrew linguist when I
was a child the the threat that fascism
might take over much of the world was
not remote that's much worse than what
we're facing now my own locality
happened to be very anti-semitic we were
the only Jewish family and uh Irish
mostly Irish and German Catholic
neighborhood much of which was pro-nazi
so I could see it better on the ground
what we're now seeing is a revival of
hate anger or fear much of it encouraged
by the rhetorical excesses of the
leadership which are stirring up
passions and terror even the ludicrous
claims about the Nicaraguan army ready
to invade us Ronald Reagan the caravan
of miserable people planning to kill us
all all of these things plus you know
praising somebody who body slam the
reporter
one thing after another all of this
raises the level of anger and fear which
has roots the roots lie in what has
happened to the general population
over the past 40 years people really
have faced significant distress
it's an astonishing fact about the
United States is that life expectancy is
actually declining that doesn't happen
in developed societies apart from you
know a major war or the huge famine but
it's happening because of social
distress and not necessarily
impoverishment the people who are
demonstrating this fear and resentment
maybe even moderately affluent but what
they see is they're stagnating in the
past that was you had this dream you
worked hard you could go I'd get ahead
your children be a little better now it
stopped it stopped for the last 40 years
as a result of very specific
socio-economic policies which have been
designed so that they sharply
concentrate wealth they enhance
corporate power that has immediate
effects on the political system for in
perfectly obvious ways even to the point
where a lobbyist literally write
legislation this onslaught has literally
cast the popular bunch of the population
aside they're stagnating they're not
moving forward they see no prospects and
they're bitter and angry about it and
then if you could talk about
specifically the targeting of the Jewish
worshippers I mean and the clear
connection that the shooter made between
this temple and the highest the what's
formally known as the Hebrew immigrant
Aid Society the group that has helped
to resettle refugees of any religion for
well over a hundred years and he
repeated words that Trump has begun
using more and more about you know
they're helping the invaders come in if
you could respond specifically to that
well I think it's pretty clear these
whipping up terror about invasions
people pouring across the border to plan
to kill us all to destroy our
civilization
you take people are already somewhat
disturbed living under harsh conditions
this can incite them to acts of extreme
violence against targets like the Jewish
a Jewish temple all the anti-semitic
tropes are pointing in that direction
but most also against afro-americans
McGrath's
any vulnerable population or population
that's easy to target for lots of
cultural and historical reasons all this
amplified by the loud speaker up in the
White House and his minions who are
doing what they can to terrorize the
population create the conditions under
which you can get something like the
attack on the synagogue so I wanted to
turn then to a clip of the Israeli
ambassador to the United States Ron
Dermer who was interviewed by a man
wielding on MSNBC on Sunday so it was
soon after the Pittsburgh synagogue
Massacre to simply say that this is
because of a one person or it only comes
on one side is to not understand the
history of anti-semitism or the reality
of anti-semitism one of the big forces
in college campuses today the
anti-semitism in those and the
anti-semites are usually not neo-nazis
on college campuses they're coming from
the radical left this is right after the
white supremacists attack on the
synagogue and the Israeli ambassador to
the u.s. is now injecting saying this
comes from both sides if you could
respond to this interestingly two days
later when Trump and his family went to
Pittsburgh the only and this is pointed
out in the New York Times the only
public official standing there to greet
him was Israel's ambassador to the
United States Ron Dermer people like the
Pittsburgh mayor and the others said
this was not the time to come well I
think it's quite easy to understand
there is a an alliance of reactionary
repressive States developing under the
US Aegis Israel is a leading member of
it Saudi Arabia's and other one of the
most brutal of regressive harsh states
in the world United Arab Emirates Egypt
under the harsh brutal dictatorship the
United States Israel and the United
States of course very mushy under this
the alignment goes way back but the
Trump administration is going way out of
its way to lend support to Israeli
crimes Israeli expansion and the Israeli
right-wing of course is filled which is
increasingly dominant is delighted so
the fact that say the Israeli ambassador
would come out and say that is really no
more surprising than the fact that John
Bolton would praise the election of a
strong advocate of torture murder and
repression the hole fits the same
pattern this issue of the number of
people who died this weekend the
horrific mass
occur eleven Jews died the model of the
coverage of knowing who each person was
hearing their names their life stories
their ages who their families were
knowing when the funerals are taking
place through the week what about this
being a model for what's happening in
Gaza I mean for example on I think it
was Friday six Palestinians were killed
with those ongoing protests near the
separation wall Israeli military has
gunned down more than 200 Palestinians
that was Friday six Palestinians died
and on Sunday three Palestinian
teenagers were killed in Israeli air
strike on the Gaza Strip your thoughts
on Dermer trying to make this connection
to get away from the issue of white
supremacy and somehow someway blame the
left well the what remember all of this
in Gaza is being done with overwhelming
US support even US weapons literally the
Gaza is on the verge of becoming
literally uninhabitable the
International monitors UN and others
have warned that within just a few years
it it may be literally unlivable I mean
right now there's virtually no potable
water the sewage pours into the the sea
because Israel is bombed and destroyed
the power plants in the sewage plants
when back in 2005 when Israel withdrew
its illegal settlers and Gaza moved them
to illegal settlements in the West Bank
imposed a siege on Gaza the official
terms for that official not making this
up or we have to impose a diet on Gaza
not harsh enough so the old die
implication being that wouldn't look
very good but harsh enough so they can
barely survive and there have been quite
apart from the brutal siege there have
been repeated attacks on Gaza by the
Israeli army gas is a virtually
defenseless this is one of the strongest
armies in the world lashing out to
devastate Gaza
there's always pretext there pretext for
everything
the Hitler a pretext for invading Poland
he was protecting Germany from the wild
terror of the poles and the Israelis
with us backing have concocted pretext
no time to go through it here there's
plenty and print about it every one of
them collapses on inspection it's just a
punching bag and the effect on the
people of Gaza is to create utter
desperation the the current March is
just an attempt to somehow break the
siege make life possible the problem
could be overcome easily simply by
providing them with the opportunities
for survival that's it not not trying to
block every attempt at political
unification of the fact factions that's
often been a pretext for another attack
some of what's going on
parts of it we've seen or just a
grotesque like when a highly trained
Israeli cypher murders a young woman far
from the border who's trying to help a
Palestinian volunteer medic young woman
who's tried to help a wounded man and a
snipe
murders are trained highly trained
snipers they know what they're doing the
International monitors have gone to the
hospitals are shocked by the kinds of
wounds they're finding purposely
designed to maim people so they'll
barely not kill them but maim them so
they won't be able to have a even take
part in the minimal life that exists
they're actually a trump had a solution
to this to the misery of Gaza and the
prospect that 2 million people half of
them children will soon be in a
situation of literally beyond the
possibility of survival they had a
lifeline what's called the UN raw
support international support which was
barely keeping them alive so Trump's
reaction is to cut it cut support for it
and even had a reason he said they're
not being grateful enough to me for my
efforts to give them the ultimate deal
that I'm planning altima deal which
means give up all your rights and forget
it I mean the the the war in Yemen which
finally at last is getting a little bit
of attention has been a major horror
story of the most careful estimates of
the killing that are now just coming out
show that there may be seven or eight
times as high as what has been the
numbers that have been given there were
in the order of 70 or 80 thousand the
analysis of these Saudi emirate programs
a long study that came out of the
Fletcher School of international
diplomacy at Tufts University recently
showed quite persuasively that the
policies of the attackers are aimed at
destroying the food supplies making sure
the population starves to death
they're also trying to close the port
through which some supplies come all of
this is fully backed by the United
States US and Britain secondarily supply
the arms us supplies of the intelligence
for the city air force which is carrying
out massive atrocities all of these
things are happening for years they've
been barely discussed now finally you're
seeing pictures on the front page of
starving Yemeni children even a call for
a ceasefire much belated little
attention to our crucial responsibility
for it just like our responsibility
which is overwhelming for the plight of
the miserable people trying to escape
from the troika Honduras El Salvador
Guatemala the three countries that have
been completely under our thumb and our
suffering bitterly for it now tried to
escape so we turned them into an
invasion mob planning to destroy us all
of this is surreal that only is
overshadowed by the failure to attend
even minimally to the literal
existential threats that are not remote
do you consider this one of the gravest
times in your lifetime in US politics no
it's one of the gravest times in human
history humans have been around for
200,000 years for the first time in
their history they have to decide and
quickly whether organized human society
is going to survive for very long so is
it the most gravest moment in my life
yes but also in all of human history the
world-renowned professor linguist and
dissident known
Chomsky he was speaking to us from
Tucson Arizona where he now teaches at
the University of Arizona
he's also Institute professor emeritus
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology where he has taught for more
than 50 years to see a transcript or a
