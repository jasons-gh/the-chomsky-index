I hope you've read or wills introduction
to Animal Farm as you probably know it
was not published found 30 years later
in his unpublished papers but it's
interesting in it he addresses himself
to the people of England free England
and he says you shouldn't feel too
self-righteous about this satirical
denunciation that alterrian enemy
because in England that young quoting
now he said in England unpopular ideas
can be suppressed without the use of
force and one of the mechanisms that he
mentions is a good education if you've
gone to the best schools lse thank you
for that clock yeah a rather ambivalent
then you have instilled into you the
understanding that there are certain
things it wouldn't do to say and I think
we can add it wouldn't do to think
that's a significant element in free
societies and carries with it severe
moral responsibility much more so than
people who suffer in authoritarian or
totalitarian states
