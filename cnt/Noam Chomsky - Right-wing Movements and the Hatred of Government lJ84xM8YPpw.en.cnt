the militia movement you know so after
the Oklahoma City bombing a lot of
attention of the militia movement poses
why you know how come they don't have a
militia movement and you know Sweden
there's nothing why we have it here well
does it have anything to do with what's
been going on here for the last twenty
years you know I mean what's going on is
pretty striking there's been a
spectacular redistribution of wealth
there's an enormous Catholic countries
just awash in capital over the profits
are going through the roof but it's very
narrowly concentrated meanwhile you take
people like say Timothy McVeigh done the
bombing you look I don't know anything
about him but if you look at that sector
of the population that he comes from
they've taken quite a beating over the
past 20 years not by any laws of nature
you know it's not so many laws of
capitalism or anything business
conscious social policy directed rolling
back the whole system of social support
and solidarity and so on whatever
developed over the past you know years
it's been a very concentrated campaign
and it's a lot of a thing people of say
Timothy McVeigh's background like you
know say white male high school
graduates that kind of category have
probably lost 20% of their income in the
last in the last 15 years as a result of
very deliberate social policy those same
policies that are putting plenty of
money into the pockets of the super-rich
well you know they don't see what's
going on and there's all the corporate
offensive which has been incredible the
propaganda offenses a big story in
itself not to talk about it but the
stuff things are beginning to come out
about it even
academic studies it's been astonishing
over the past 50 years picking up in the
past 20 years and one of its goals is to
demonize government they want people to
hate government no it's not because they
don't remember they're the tools and
tyrants of government and they intend
that to continue so they want the
government to continue pouring money
into their pockets powerful government
on the other hand it's very good idea to
get people to hate government why well
you know there's plenty of things that
the government does that are pretty
awful and that like to hate but that's
not why they want you to hate they hate
government for two reasons one is
because government is because we put it
government is the shadow cast by
business over Society and it's better to
have people look at the shadow and not
the substance so they don't hate for
fortune 500 you know hate government
hate the tool not the tyrant you know
the the other reason is that government
has a flaw it's potentially democratic
you know potentially it can be
influenced by people and we even know
how to do it and it does work so there
are ways for people to participate in
some fashion in effecting and
influencing governmental decisions and
that's a serious flaw if power shifts
over into the hands of private tyrannies
which are totally unaccountable and are
basically totalitarian institutions it's
perfect then there's no way for the
public to do a thing like you can't we
can't decide make any decisions about GE
policy let's say and we can't organize
to do anything about it except you know
in very directly like you can't like
even at the palette Aryan state you can
influence policies by disruption you
know all sorts of things but there's no
mechanism for doing it
these are tyrannical organizations and
that's long been understood
in fact in fact even their roots come
out of the same background as Bolshevism
and fascism if you look at it and if
power can be shifted over into their
hands we're home free you know then
there is no threat of democracy that's a
large part I think the main part of the
purpose of getting what's cool you know
evolution getting moving power from the
federal government down the state
government I mean the federal government
is basically the shadow of big business
but state governments are even the
shadow of middle sized business they're
very easily manipulated by private power
a lot more than the federal government
so therefore if you can get decisions
you get block grants down to the states
you know they're gonna be so controlled
by local business interests that that
money is going to end up in the pockets
of rich people I mean it more or less
does any no but it'll go far more in
this case so yeah all of these are of
any how coming back to Timmons the right
wing movements yeah they end up with the
move with what's called anti politics
because if your life is collapsing and
you don't understand what's going on and
you just can't see the source of power
because it's sort of you know read
Fortune magazine and you got drummed
into your head over and over actually
for 50 years this you know hate labor
hate the government welfare mothers and
so on and so forth what's called auntie
politics then you take it out on
somebody and you take it out on
immigrants or you know black mothers or
or government offices that's the only
thing you see around that you can blame
anything on so I think and so what's
missing in the analysis of the
right-wing movements I think is the
source of it no it's not coming out of
nowhere it's not because people are
crazy you know it's a very devastated
Society
it's full of cults you know fanaticism
people are isolated from one another
they can't figure out rational
constructive ways to respond to what's
going on and the end result can be
pretty ugly people like Pat Buchanan are
exploiting that to the land
but they're exploiting something that's
real and that's what it'll be discussed
not waiting
