and now I would like to present noam
chomsky thanks well I the most recent
article was my series that I've seen I
hope that surprises them it was a few
weeks ago a an article in which I read
as being sort of a account of work in
progress and an outline of future
projects to be undertaken which are of
immense significance in the article
Monsieur began with the typically
incisive analysis of the current bless
the Oslo process the last couple of
years explaining lucidly expanding on
things he's written before which
unfortunately not enough people paid
attention to of how the built-in
properties of it were almost with the
logical necessity are going to lead to
very ugly outcomes which have been
happening ever since and are now more
and more apparent but then he went on
and the book of the article was devoted
to something else namely constructive
alternative these constructive
alternatives well for what it's worth I
think I think both I think are right on
track and back to always thought so this
is the moment when I could give a speech
but i'm not going to don't worry about
it some other time but i think that the
account is exactly right that what has
to be done is to dismantle the year I
the set of ideas which were formulated
as an totally inconceivable to state
settlement which would have been a
rotten outcome for everybody and was
never going to happen anyway because of
the balance of forces in the
international situation and to recognize
that a settlement has to be based on
ideas which in fact of coexistence and
justice and equality and democracy an
interaction actually throughout the
region not only in the former Palestine
ideas which actually is necessary out
have deep roots often forgotten but
quite real in the separate traditions of
the conflicting parties and in fact
there are even more deeply rooted in the
principles to which almost everyone pays
at least lip service namely the ones
articulated and codified in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
which remains a very distant goal even
as we approach its 50th anniversary in a
few months you might one might argue
maybe even a receding goal and a mint
certainly distant well all of these are
causes to which Monsieur has dedicated
himself for many years and made the
highly valued contributions to the
rewards of retirement are sure to be
great for Monsieur his family and many
others not the least of these rewards I
expect with confidence would be the
opportunity liddie is now afforded to
dedicate himself even more fully and
more energetically and to these to these
goals to turning them into a
pretty helping bring them closer to
reality that's a prospect that I
personally look forward to seeing
developed and participating in as I can
over the years and all I can say is that
I wish him and his family the greatest
pleasure and success in the wonderful
years that I'm sure lie head
