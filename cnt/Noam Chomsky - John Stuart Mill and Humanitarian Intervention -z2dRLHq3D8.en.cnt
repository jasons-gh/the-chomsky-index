the first serious essay about the topic
of humanitarian intervention term 1859
the term doesn't use it wasn't used but
that's what it's about this is an essay
by John Stuart Mill and it's of
particular significance that not only
because of its content it is kind of the
classical essay on the topic but because
of who he was he was a man of unusual
moral integrity intelligence pretty hard
to match him it turns out that with a
few changes of names the content of his
essay could appear today I think don't
want to I'll quote you some of the
central parts I don't want a paraphrase
milk there was a view in England at the
time is the late 1850s that England
which was of course the world's
hegemonic power of the day that England
should keep away from intervention
unless some quoting him unless its
safety is threatened or any of its
interests hostile and unfairly or
endangered but Amil objected to that
standard view he thought that was a
mistake
and the reason was he said that England
is a novelty in the world
it's a remarkable nation that acts only
in the service of others it's dedicated
to peace but if the aggressions of
barbarians force it through a successful
war itself lessly bears the cost while
the fruits it shares in fraternal
equality with the whole human race and
that even includes the barbarians that
it conquered for their own benefit he
does say that England has a fault
misplaced modesty that leads Englishmen
to AB negate the character which we
might with truth lay claim to of being
incomparably the most conscientious of
all nations
national axe England is not only
peerless but near-perfect it has no
aggressive designs it desires no benefit
to itself at the expense of others its
policies are blameless and laudable and
he went on to say that England should
not be deterred by the fact that it is
held up to public we on the continent
incidentally the thoughts of others
outside the continent don't enter into
this question including those who Adam
Smith referred to long before and when
he condemned the what he called the
savage and justice of the Europeans
particularly the vile acts of the
British in India but not by 1859 it's
only that we England receives publicly
on the continent held up toggle flee on
the continent but he nevertheless said
despite this England should be ready to
intervene in the service of others of
course however its motives may be
misrepresented by those who cannot
believe the magnificence that is before
their eyes and atribute cynical motives
to the British it's a great philosopher
he went in to study the criteria for
intervention and he said it's
permissible when dealing with barbarians
those with a low degree of civilization
whose minds are not capable of
comprehending rules
let alone observing them these
barbarians which is essentially everyone
outside of Europe even outside of
England they need the protection of a
civilised power of Christian Europe
particularly of course the noblest among
them
well mill was interesting to look at the
timing of when Mill was writing this it
was 1859 that was right after the public
exposure very
exposure of Britain's and vicious
atrocities in India and suppressing what
in British history is called the Indian
Mutiny a rebellion in India now this was
you might tell you how Johar Lal Nehru
described that in his history of India
written from his prison cell he was
imprisoned by the British he described
it as a ghastly and horrible picture
showing man at his worst sighting
contemporary records both British and
Indian which are quite accurate this
incidentally was not long after the
Irish Famine horrible Irish Famine in
which the England's role was not obscure
it was it was also in the midst of the
Second Opium War that was 1856 to 1860
this is right in the middle of it when
bill was writing and that had its own
horrors bombardment and deliberate
burning down of thousands of houses and
densely settled the Canton for example
with many killed that had caused such an
uproar in England that Parliament was
dissolved and a new election was called
all of this shortly before Mill Road and
of course he knew all about it he was an
educated literate person he was also an
official of the East India Company which
was right at the center of the
atrocities in India well that's the
context in short we can say that England
was the nineteenth-century
counterpart of today's and now quoting
today's idealistic new world bent on
ending inhumanity in a noble phase of
its foreign policy pursuing policies
with a saintly glow quoting the New York
Times
leading commentators in the 1990s at the
end of the 90s the nation reached the
height of its glory acting from altruism
and moral fervor alone it's a historian
David from cand dedicating itself for
the first time in history to principles
and values instead of self-interest
that's left Havel and thus opening a new
era of enlightenment very much like
England the England that Mill was
describing well that raises some
questions plainly if that's the peak of
nobility of humanitarian intervention
exactly what is humanitarian
intervention
