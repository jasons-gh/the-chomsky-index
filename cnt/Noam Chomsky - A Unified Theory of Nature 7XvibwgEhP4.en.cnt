the general concession before even that
the wall stays one and the form of falls
then is also one scientist but it also
answers all right let's clear what it
means I mean that in the Natural
Sciences one sort of works by a kind of
a hope the things will become unified
but they never have been I'm after the
present day there are aspects even a
physical theory that are not unified and
they take gravity tanam still not
unified with weak forces people hope
that there'll be a unified theory of
nature but of course when they talk
about nature they're talking about a
very special part of there's no there's
no rational reason to believe that
things like human thought and action
belong to the kind of nature that
physicists are talking about that's the
Cartesian problem again so sure everyone
you know kind of hopes somehow but
there'll be a more unified way of
explaining things the reason for that
hope is just that you're hopefully
deeper understanding and if the word
universe turns out to be divided the
separate realms you won't have
understanding of why those realms
difficult for what their relation is so
naturally one hopes that there are
limits to understanding you know okay so
many people might hope there are limits
to understanding and I can see reasons
for that too but within science you kind
of act on the working hypothesis that
you can always understand more and say
that you can always understand more is
to say that you expect a kind of unity
of nature but every time you lake legs
up like you link biology and chemistry
you understand a little more you
understand things about keeping biology
you couldn't understand before but
whether there are limits to this process
whether the world is in fact designed so
that this there is a unified account of
everything it's an open question and the
fact the idea that humans might be
capable of finding it even if it's there
is
not all of these
