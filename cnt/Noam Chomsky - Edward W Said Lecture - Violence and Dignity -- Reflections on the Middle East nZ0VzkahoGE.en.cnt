thank you thank you good evening
everyone
I'm very sorry for the slight delay as
you saw the weather was atrocious and a
lot of people were late so we now have
more or less a packed house and I'd like
to welcome you tonight on behalf of the
organizing committee of the Edward Sayid
annual lecture Mariam Saeed who will
introduce professor Chomsky Mary Kay
Wilmers I haven't seen yet I hope she's
here at Hef's wife and Jacqueline Rose
also on behalf of the London Review of
Books and the am Curtin foundation I
welcome you tonight this is our fourth
lecture in a series which I hope will go
on for many years and tonight we present
professor Chomsky speaking about
violence and dignity reflections on the
Middle East professor Chomsky needs no
introduction for over 60 years he's
helped generations of citizens including
students activists and intellectuals
unravel and analyze some of the most
challenging and complex questions facing
them facing us and in an astonishing
number of disciplines ranging from
linguistics to international relations
and so on but it is his principled
engagement with and struggle against
injustice throughout these years that
have made his insights so very forceful
and necessary
helping many of us in our attempts not
only to better understand the world but
to also strive to make it more just and
equitable before we begin however I'd
also like to thank Mary whet Mary Kay
Wilmers again and the London Review of
Books for their fantastic and generous
support to us this year - Fiona McMurray
and her team who have handled press
relations so very effectively and the
mosaic groom's team who have worked
tirelessly to make this evening a
success I think you can see that we're
already there more or less
professor Chomsky will be introduced by
Miriam and will speak for approximately
40 minutes he'll then take a small
number of questions afterwards he has
also very generously signed a limited
number of copies of his new book power
systems which are available to purchase
in the outside hall please join me in
welcoming Miriam side
I would like to start by thanking all
the people our Martha thanked from the
London Review of Books to the team who
made all this possible and also the a.m.
Catan Foundation who has been our
biggest supporter from the inception of
this lecture series good evening
everybody we all know that Professor
Noam Chomsky needs no introduction I
will try to be as brief as I can in
order not to take too much of his time
reknowned
academics public intellectuals activists
and humanists are the words used to
describe Noam Chomsky and my late
husband Edward sight exceptional people
with vision responsible intellectuals
whose interpretations on what is what is
taking place in the real world is unique
and different they're respected fields
had to do with the importance of
language Chomsky as a linguist and
Edward as a literary critic what they
say is always create clear and precise
Noam and Edward met in the 1960s and
over the years maintained an off-and-on
conversation on various subjects
including current affairs and policy
formation at some point they toyed with
the idea of collaborating together on a
book both were very busy
unfortunately this idea never
materialized the telephone the Xerox
machine and the mail were the only means
of communication during the 1960s and
70s copies of hard-to-find printed
information such as newsletters or
translations of foreign language
articles would be sent by mail Edward
and Noam had a friend who was a very
important source of this kind of
alternate information
his name was Israel shocked and Israeli
professor of chemistry a Holocaust
survivor a remarkable man who spent
hours and hours every day translating
from Hebrew to English you
paper articles that appear in the
Israeli press and commenting on them in
the beginning he would write his
translations by hand
eventually he accepted to use the
typewriter both Eduard and norm were
recipient of his diligent work and his
analysis challenged them and others to
Bro to probe further nowadays we are
privileged to have the world of
cyberspace news and images are received
instantly thanks to the internet and
cellular phones with cameras however it
takes a very long time to sift through
the massive amounts of alternate
information
Edward was getting overwhelmed with the
barrage of information Nomi introduced
him to a wonderful woman called Chiffre
stern a paralegal by profession and like
Israel Jacques had taken it upon herself
to provide others with hard to find
information Chiffre spends hours on the
internet compiling information from
unknown sources and emails her output
and emails her output to people like
Noam and Edward during the last few
years of his life Edward would eagerly
await Chiffre input and after going
through her package would say to me
Chiffre is amazing before he passed
before Edward passed away he wrote a new
preface for the twenty five year
anniversary edition of Orientalism and I
caught and lastly most important
humanism is the only and I would go as
far as to say the final resistance we
have against the inhuman practices and
in justices that disfigure human history
we are most privileged to have with us
tonight a rare voice with deep insight
and intuition please join me in
welcoming professor Noam Chomsky the
most prolific humanist and resistor
whose value will work over 60 years
income income
passes the whole word globe and rich is
the first farthest corners of the earth
thank you
thank you I am a Swedish novelist
Henning Mankell tells of an experience
in Mozambique at the peak of the hideous
atrocities of the apartheid era he
describes how he saw his walking towards
the village he saw a man walking towards
him and ragged clothes in his words in
his deep misery
the wretched survivor had painted shoes
on his feet in a way to defend his
dignity when everything was lost he had
found the colors from the earth and he
had painted shoes on his feet
seems like that will evoke many poignant
memories among people who've witnessed
cruelty and degradation and also the
steady resistance of the Sami Dean Baro
Rajesh ahadith term for the those who
endure remarkable book on Palestinians
under occupation thirty years ago like
many of you and in fact much less than
many of you I've witnessed many scenes
like that throughout the world over many
years once again last October when I was
able to visit Gaza for the first time I
tried earlier but couldn't make it
greeting me on my return home were the
reports on the latest outburst of
shocking crimes the November Israeli
assault supported by the United States
and tolerated politely by Europe as
usual one of the first reports I
received was a photograph by a young
Gaza journalist man have known for some
years
met again in Gaza the photograph showed
a doctor in a hospital ward holding the
hideously charred corpse of a murdered
infant the doctor is the director and a
head of surgery at the han eunice
hospital and south of Gaza were actually
a few days earlier I had heard his
passionate appeal for drugs and surgical
equipment so that patients would not
have to rise in agony a wild awaiting
simple surgery that cannot be performed
for lack of facilities as the November
attack exploded the United Nations
released its weekly review of the
permanent humanitarian crisis in Gaza it
reported that 40% of essential drugs are
out of stock consequence of the Israeli
blockade and Western complicity which we
should not forget and the unwillingness
of the new Egyptian government to offend
the masters it appears that the court in
credible reports that the borders are
still under the control of Mubarak's
dreaded Mahabharat secret police is
closely linked to the CIA and Israeli
Mossad just last week I received another
article by the same Gaza journalist you
may have seen describing the terrible
impact of the Morsi government's latest
assault against the people of Gaza it
has devised a new way to block the
tunnels that are a lifeline for people
imprisoned under our siege and constant
attack flooding them with filthy sewage
same days news brought a report by the
Israeli human rights group B'Tselem on a
new device adopted by the Israeli army
to overcome the
ingenuity of the Sammy Dean hidden
coping with tear gas
spraying protestors and homes with
powerful Jets of raw sewage sewage this
is punishment for the weekly nonviolent
protests against ills Israel's illegal
separation wall actually an annexation
wall so more evidence that great minds
have similar thoughts in this kind case
combining criminal repression with a
useful humiliation the tragedy of Gaza
dates back to 1948 hundreds of thousands
of Palestinians and fled in terror or
were forcibly expelled across the border
by the conquering Israeli forces they
actually continued to truck them across
the border after the official ceasefire
for at least four years we've recently
learned a recent Israeli scholarship
notably the very important work of avi
Roz it reveals
sykes documentary evidence that the
government's goal was to drive the
refugees into the Sinai and if feasible
also the rest of the population of
Palestine these long-standing goals may
well be a factor contributing to Egypt's
reluctance to open the border to free
passage of people and goods that barred
by the cruel western-backed Israeli
siege getting rid of the Arabs of Gaza
was only one facet of much broader goals
during the 1948 expulsion Israeli
government Arabists predicted that the
refugees would either assimilate
elsewhere or would be crushed and died
while most of them would turn into human
dust and the waste of society and join
the most
first classes in the Arab countries as
for the Arabs of what called the Land of
Israel themselves Prime Minister David
ben-gurion held that they have only one
function left to them to run away the
causes of the refugee flight are no
longer seriously in question there very
few who would question the conclusions
of the most prominent Israeli historian
of the topic
Ben Morris in his words the refugee
problem was caused by attacks by Jewish
forces on Arab villages and towns and by
the inhabitants fear of such attacks
compounded by expulsion atrocities
rumours of atrocities and by the crucial
Israeli cabinet decision in June 1948
right in the middle of the atrocities at
the barre refugee return leaving the
Palestinians crushed with some 700,000
driven into exile Morris is critical of
Israeli atrocities in part because they
are too limited ben-gurion great error
he says perhaps a fatal mistake was not
to have cleansed the whole country the
whole Land of Israel as far as the
Jordan River there's actually evidence
just appeared in the last few days from
recently declassified Israeli cabinet
records that ben-gurion apparently had
the same same reaction to the failure
the fatal mistake of not completing the
purification of the land as it's called
from the earliest days Arabs were
regarded as an alien implant in the land
of is
as the Balfour Declaration was released
hi invites Minh as you know Israel's
first president the most respected
Zionist figure he remarked that the is a
British had informed him that in
Palestine there are a few hundred
thousand Negroes Schwartz's affection he
said but that's a matter of no
significance
veidt's Minh in turn had informed Lord
Balfour that the issue known as the Arab
problem in Palestine will be of merely
local character and in effect anyone
cognizant of the situation that does not
consider it a highly significant factor
so displacement of the inhabitants by
the Jewish settlement raises no moral
issue a later President Israeli
president crime heretic also
incidentally a labor dove he articulated
the basic guidelines in 1972 the dates
important this is often attributed to
nom beggin and laocoon but it's not it's
a old labor party program he said I do
not deny the Palestinians any place or
stand or opinion on every matter but
certainly I am not prepared to consider
them as partners in any respect in a
land that has been consecrated in the
hands of our nation for thousands of
years for the Jews of this land
there cannot be any partner that's the
does that I'm quoting the humanists Lord
Balfour himself who was a devoted
Christian Zionist he expressed similar
views these were actually quite a common
element of elite Christian Zionism which
long predates Jewish Zionism it included
the leading figures in the United States
as well that was primarily a British
phenomenon that they were immersed in
the holy book with lessons that the Land
of Israel was
promised to the Jews others are
interlopers Woodrow Wilson Harry Truman
many others it's for example why one of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's leading
advisors an important cabinet member
described the Jewish return to Palestine
as the most remarkable event in history
in the United States a traditional elite
Christian Zionism is now buttress by an
enormous right-wing Christian movement
passionately pro-israel deeply a D
Semitic forms much of the current base
of the current Republican Party it's
important to recognize that to
understand lots of things that take
place regularly like the Chuck Hagel
hearings a few weeks ago at Christian
Zionism is an important factor in
shaping policy towards Israel Palestine
from early years there are others it's
noteworthy for example that the
strongest support for Israel in the
international arena comes from the
countries that are called the
Anglosphere
Britain and soft shoes US Canada and
Australia these are unusual in history
of imperialism and that there are
settler colonial societies based on
extermination or expulsion of indigenous
populations in favour of a higher race
and in them such behaviors kind of
instinctively considered unnatural and
praiseworthy
so what Israel's doing looks entirely
normal
quite apart from the religious element
the crucial factors certainly since 1967
our strategic and economic and still
prevail but others shouldn't be
overlooked well going back to Gaza after
Israel's 1967 conquests torture took new
forms at
too awful the review all seems to be
pretty much under control until December
1987 when the Intifada suddenly broke
out first in Gaza spreading quickly
throughout the territories largely
nonviolent it stimulated quite
impressive popular organization anyone
who visited I was there could see that
large respects revolt against the feudal
society the Palestinian society it
elicited brutal repression became
reached its peak of savagery under the
orders of Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin's another admired of he informed
the peace now delegation at the peak of
the state crimes that meaningless us
dialogue with the PLO was designed to
grant Israel on quoting him at least a
year to suppress the uprising by force
the inhabitants of the territories are
subject to harsh military and economic
pressure robbing explain that in the end
they will be broken abandon battening
their hopes for a life of dignity Gaza
was placed under closure that time
breaking any connection to the rest of
Palestine this was extended shortly
after within the framework of the Oslo
Accords of 1993 at which if anyone cares
declared that Gaza and the West Bank are
an indivisible territorial unity which
cannot be separated us and Israel we're
doing the opposite and that remains us
Israeli policy to the present it's quite
significant separation of the two
regions guarantees that if any limited
autonomy is gained in the West Bank it
will have no access to the outside world
except through Jordan and that's being
barred by the systematic expulsion of
the inhabitants of the Jordan Valley
expulsion that the Israeli press
accurately called calls T her Bobby Cobb
purification of the valley cleansing of
the valley these are programs that have
slowly reduced its population from
300,000 in 1967 to less than 60,000
today they continue steadily with
extreme cruelty will soon be
commemorating the 20th anniversary of
the Oslo Accords they were held at the
time as a historic breakthrough on the
path towards resolution of the
israel-palestine conflict and not
universally held of course certainly not
by prominent Palestinian figures who
could see easily what's happening among
them was Raja Shahada
he was Palestinian Palestine is leading
legal specialists he'd been trying in
vain for years to block Israel's
violations of international law and the
territories he recognized right away
that the Accords were a surrender in the
interests of Israel and the tunis based
PLO leadership which was being
marginalized within the territories but
is now restored to power through the
side channel in Oslo
another one was Edward Sayed who saw
exactly what was happening and condemned
the capitulation at once another was a
historian Rashid Khalidi he was actually
an advisor to the Palestinian
negotiators at the Madrid negotiations
he described the Oslo agreements as an
infernal trap still another was Haider
Abdullah fee is probably the most
respected Palestinian within the
territories he headed the Palestinian
delegation at the us-run Madrid
and he refused to capitulate the
us-israeli demands he insisted that any
agreement must at the very least bar
illegal Israeli settlement in the
territories that issue was ignored at
Oslo and Abdel Shafi refused to attend
the signing of the ceremony on the White
House lawn described as a day of awe in
the American press
there were many illusions about Gaza but
no basis for them whatsoever to
understand what was taking place that
was sufficient to read the short several
pages of the Declaration of Principles
the document that emerged these were
quite explicit about satisfying Israel's
demands and completely silent on
Palestinian national rights article 1 of
the declaration states that the end
result of the process noticed the end
result when everything's finished is to
be a permanent settlement based on
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338
anyone familiar with diplomacy knows
that these resolutions say nothing at
all about Palestinian rights
apart from vague reference to just
settlement of the refugee problem though
mention of Palestinians there are UN
resolutions referring to Palestinian
national rights but these were ignored
in the Declaration of Principles so if
the culmination of the peace process
would be as clearly articulated in the
Declaration of Principles then
Palestinians could kiss goodbye to any
hopes for some meaningful form of
autonomy of national rights in the
former Palestine the assault on the
people of Gaza mounted very sharply in
January 2006 when Palestinians committed
one of their major crimes in the first
free election in the Arab world
they voted the wrong way such
insubordination
conflicts very sharply with the really
existing passion for democracy that's
regularly proclaimed by Western leaders
in the political class and at once the
US and Israel with Europe toddling
obediently behind that it usually does
instituted the harsh measures to punish
the miscreants actually punishment
became even more severe your year later
when Gazans committed an even worse
crime immediately after the elections
with their unwelcome outcome Washington
turned through standard operating
procedure when criminal populations vote
improperly prepare a military coup this
was to be led by Fatah strongman
Muhammad Allah the elected government
preempted the coup that's an event
denounced in the West as Hamas is a
violent takeover of Gaza context
suppressed it's bad enough to vote the
wrong way in a free election but
preventing a us run military coup to
overthrow the government
that's a truly unspeakable crime and
accordingly the siege and other
punishments were sharply increased in
retaliation we then move on to Operation
Cast Lead other atrocities I won't
review the shocking story which
Westerners should know by heart given
their critical role throughout well
throughout these years Gaza has been a
showcase for violence of every
imaginable crime kind the record shows
such sadistic and very carefully planned
atrocities as Operation Cast Lead
called infanticide by the Norwegian
physician mots Gilbert who worked
tirelessly at Gaza's al-shifa hospital
with his dedicated Palestinian and
Norwegian colleagues right through the
criminal assault the term infanticide is
appropriate hundreds of children were
massacred and from there the violence
ranges through just about every kind of
cruelty that humans have used their
higher mental faculties to devise up to
the pain of Exile that Edward Edward
Sade wrote about so eloquently
this is particularly stark and Gaza
where older people can still look across
the border towards the homes a few miles
away from which they were driven or to
be more precise they could do that if
they were able to approach the border
without being killed one form of
punishment has been to close off the
Gaza side of the border that includes
almost half the arable land according to
the leading academic scholar of the Gaza
and Harvard's and Sarah Roy while a
showcase for the human capacity for
violence and humiliation the Gaza zijn
also an inspiring exemplar of the demand
for dignity the first phrase wasn't here
is in Gaza when asking about personal
aspirations is for a life of dignity the
distinguished human rights lawyer
internationally known human rights
lawyer Raji surrani writes from his Gaza
home that what has to be kept in mind is
that the occupation and the absolute
closure is an ongoing attack on the
human dignity of the people in Gaza in
particular and all Palestinians
generally it is systematic degradation
humiliation isolation fragmentation of
the
Tinian people while bombs were once
again raining down on defenseless
civilians in Gaza last November he
repeated that we demand justice and
accountability we dream of a normal life
in freedom and dignity and others
perceive the same reality in the lancet
leading International Medical Journal a
visiting Stanford physician who was
appalled by what he witnessed described
Gaza as something of a laboratory for
observing an absence of dignity a
condition that has devastating effects
on physical mental and social well-being
still quoting him the constant
surveillance from the sky collective
punishment through blockade and
isolation the intrusion into homes and
communications restrictions on those
trying to travel or marry or work and
make it difficult to live the dignified
life in Gaza young woman professional
who managed to escape from Gaza to
Canada doctor there nada agiels her name
she writes about her a couple of weeks
ago about her 87 year old grandmother
who still trapped in the Gaza prison
before her expulsion she writes she
owned a house farms and land and she
enjoyed honor dignity and hope and
amazingly like Palestinians rather
generally she hasn't given up hope so I
keel continues when I saw my grandmother
in November 2012 as she was unusually
happy or in the midst of the latest
atrocities surprised by her high spirits
I asked for an explanation she looked me
in the eye and to my surprise said that
she was no longer worried about her
native village and the life of dignity
that she is lost for her irrevocably
when I see you
her grandmother said I know that our
native village long ago destroyed is in
your heart and I also know that you're
not alone in your journey don't be
discouraged we're getting there
the call for dignity resounds through
the Arab Spring which despite all of its
uncertain outcomes is doubtless
development of historic significance
prominent Lebanese commentator rummy
Horry
writes that the process at hand now in
Tunisia and Egypt will continue to
ripple through the entire Arab world as
ordinary citizens realize that they must
seize and protect their birth rights of
freedom and dignity
the uprising as you know was sparked by
the self-immolation of Muhammad was easy
in reaction to his humiliating and
degrading treatment Muhammad did what he
did for the sake of his dignity his
mother recounts on the anniversary of
his suicide cart statue he was a hadn't
sold things with cart the cart statue
was unveiled in his honor in the town
where he carried out the action that
triggered the uprising spreads
throughout Middle East North Africa the
ceremony was attended by two newzeas
first elected president who thanked him
and those he inspired for bringing
dignity to the entire Tunisian people in
the oil dictatorships the uprisings have
been suppressed often by violence much
to the relief of Western powers but not
entirely
so in quoits while protesters were
fleeing from the riot police equate the
political scientist commented that
people want dignity and political
participation and equality before the
law and
a revolution not the kwaity citizens at
least great majority who do the work
might have other ideas in mind such
driving sentiments of oppressed people
extend far beyond the Arab Spring we've
just passed the centenary of the great
textile strike of immigrant workers in
Lawrence Massachusetts near where I live
led by the Wobblies who played a leading
role in the labor movement until it was
crushed a few years later by Woodrow
Wilson's Red Scare the work the strikers
won won the strike under the banner
Bread and Roses now famous slogan
sustenance and dignity and today
immigrant workers in immigrant activists
in the United States organize in what
they call the immigrant dignity campaign
the lively labor press of the early
industrial revolution bitterly condemned
the rising industrial system for
depriving those driven to the mills of
their dignity as free human beings the
early 1970s witnessed the last militant
strike wave in the United States before
the labor month movement has once again
been crushed under the neoliberal
assault on the population which taking
place everywhere you're suffering from
it here
the strikes were called for we're a call
for bread and roses for workers control
of the workplace so that they could
uphold their basic dignity and that
continues today with the spread of work
Iran enterprises and cooperatives on the
rather impressive scale these
aspirations have been suppressed by
violence throughout history but the
sparks never extinguished and
continues to burst into flames the
search for dignity is understood
instinctively by those who hold the
clothes and who recognize that apart
from violence the best way to undermine
it is by humiliation that's second
nature in prisons everywhere it reaches
its sordid extreme in places like Bagram
and Guantanamo portrayed unforgettably
by Victoria Britain who's recently
broadened the shameful picture to
include the fate of the women left
behind the normal practice in Israeli
prisons has gained some attention the
last couple of weeks because of the
concern that it might spark another
uprising third intifada after the death
of a young man Arafat Jaradat he was
arrested at his home at midnight of
course that's to properly intimidate the
family he was charged with having thrown
stones and a Molotov cocktail a few
months earlier during israel's november
attack on Gaza he was healthy and
vigorous when arrested he was last seen
alive by in court by his lawyer who
describes him as doubled over scared
confused and shrunken the court reacted
by remanding him to another 12 days of
what's called interrogation and he was
found dead in his cell Israeli
journalist Amira Hass writes that
Palestinians do not need an Israeli
investigation for them Jarrah that's
death is much bigger than the tragedy he
and his family have suffered from their
experience Jarrah that's death is proof
that the Israeli system routinely uses
torture and from their experience they
know that the goal of torture is not
only to convict someone
but to deter and subjugate an entire
people by humiliation degradation terror
familiar features of repression at home
and abroad and Europeans should not
overlook their willing and significant
participation in the latest phase of
Washington's reign of tortures I say
latest phase because there are Apple
presidents the Open Society Institute
just released its study called
globalizing torture a CIA secret
detentions and extraordinary rendition
you know what that means sending people
to the most miserable dictatorships that
could be tortured properly without us
saying we're doing it the study reveals
that 54 countries participated in the
campaign that included most of Europe
and most of the rest of the world
actually one region of the world was
exempt a Latin America virtually alone
it refused to participate in globalizing
torture and that's quite a remarkable
fact only a few years ago the Latin
America remained Washington's obedient
backyard did what it was told and it was
also during this period one of the
torture capitals of the world not any
longer one can easily see why Western
elites are so concerned about the threat
of democracy and so committed to
limiting it most recently in the Middle
East the need for humiliating those who
raise their heads is an inner Attica
element of the Imperial mentality just
one typical case was a highly regarded
liberal commentator of the New York
Times also a the East specialist Thomas
Friedman he was asked on TV for his
recommendations for the US UK occupying
army
a couple of months after the invasion
and his answer was elegant and
forthright quoted he said we needed to
go over there basically take out a very
big stick right in the heart of that
world what Muslims needed to see was
American boys and girls going from house
to house from bus route to Baghdad and
saying which part of this sentence don't
you understand you don't think we care
about our open society
you think this bubble of terrorism
fantasy we're just going to let it grow
well suck on this mainly what they did
so in short a severe dose of humiliation
administered by American boys and girls
will teach the terrified women and
children whose houses they break in to
teach them they better stop terrorizing
us well as usual it elicited a little
comment the part from people who are
called the misguided sentimentalists the
need not just control but also to
humiliate the victims is second nature
to political leaders as well case after
case one interesting case was in 1988 a
year when the Palestinian National
Council formally accepted the
international consensus on a two-state
settlement the US by then was becoming
an international laughingstock with its
unwillingness to hear Yasser Arafat's
call for peaceful diplomacy and the
reasons were explained by Secretary of
State George Shultz in his memoirs also
respected statements statesmen he
informed his boss Ronald Reagan that
Arafat was saying in one place UNK
and he was saying at another place click
the club but nowhere will he yet bring
himself to say uncle in the style of
abject surrender that's demanded of the
lower orders
well Israel actually did hear the call
for a political settlement and it
reacted at once by declaring that there
could be no additional Palestinian state
between Israel and Jordan Jordan's a
Palestinian state by Israeli fire
whatever misguided Jordanians and
Palestinians might think Washington very
quickly endorsed Israel's reaction it's
the James Baker plan of December 1989
all of this has been quite effectively
excised from history there's no need to
sample the reflexive resort to the
principle in imperial history one case
that probably has not been forgotten by
the victims is the attitudes of the
anglo-iranian oil company administers
towards what they called the woggs
during the glory days of the of the
company in their words the only way to
handle the logs is to browbeat them to
cal them into submission with the iron
fist always poised when such gentler
means do not suffice
Lorenza brave and dignified a leader
Mohammed Mossadegh it was subjected to
ugly abuse and humiliation by the
British government and the educated
classes in the u.s. to because he sought
to implement Iran's right to take
control of its own reserves resources
these incidentally are called our
resources in internal documents which by
accident happen to be somewhere else
my thought I was a dedicated
constitutionalist he insisted on keeping
the completely nonviolent means like I
ended and he paid for it
with the US UK military coup in 1953
which was greatly lauded in the West so
the New York Times editors for example
soberly explained that underdeveloped
countries with rich resources now have
an object lesson in the heavy cost that
must be paid by one of their number
which goes berserk with fanatical
nationalism it's perhaps too much to
hope that Iran's experience will prevent
the rise of Musa those and other
countries but that experience may at
least strengthen the hands of more
reasonable and more foreseeing leaders
who will have a clear-eyed understanding
of the principles of decent behavior
meaning crawl properly and say uncle
when you're supposed to and it did for
many years though by the 1970s the tide
of independent nationalism could no
longer be crushed by violence these
attitudes are so close to the surface
that they break through at the slightest
provocation that happened at once when
the woggs asserted their rights in the
early 70s and sought to overcome the
sharp decline in oil prices relative to
other commodities which had been so
beneficial to the West thanks to its
effective controls influential
intellectual irving kristol he's one of
the godfathers of contemporary
conservatism he wrote that in
significant nations like insignificant
people can quickly experience delusions
of significance which has to be driven
from their primitive minds by force and
truth explained the days of gunboat
diplomacy are never over
gunboats are as necessary for
international order as police cars are
for domestic orders thoughts widely
echoed sometimes humiliation can take
slightly more subtle forms the one was
the topic of a lecture here
two years ago an honor Edwards alien by
Rashid Khalidi
his title was a human dignity in
Jerusalem prep somebody heard it holiday
discussed a project of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center which is dedicated to
promotion of human rights and dignity
the project was to build a Center for
human dignity in Jerusalem the site they
chose is the mamela Cemetery in
Jerusalem the most venerated Muslim
burial place in Palestine where
companions of the prophet or reputedly
very many other honored figures actually
parts had already been taken for a
parking lot on the site of Israel's
independence square the idea of
desecrating a cemetery to construct a
Center for human dignity that could only
occur to people so dedicated to
humiliation of their victims as they
can't perceive what they're doing there
was an appeal to bar the project it was
denied by the Israeli Supreme Court well
finally I'd like to say a few words on
how these themes which just run through
history how they arise in the foreign
policy issues that are of primary
significance for US policymakers and for
the US political class at least if we
judge by the presidential debates Chuck
Hagel senatorial hearings and the
coverage they've received in the there
was a foreign policy debate last of the
debates before the election they too
contestants the two countries
predominated overwhelmingly Israel and
Iran Obama Romney two candidates vied
with each other in proclaiming their
undying loyalty to Israel and in
identifying Iran as the gravest threat
to world peace in the Hagel hearings
there were 136 mentions of Israel 135 of
Iran scattered mentions of mention of
other countries foreign policy issues a
Hagel was berated by the Republicans and
it's crucial to remember that it was the
Republicans for being insufficiently
loyal to Israel and not sufficiently
dedicated to bombing Iran if it does not
capitulate well in the case of Israel
there's been near unanimous
international consensus on a diplomatic
settlements been blocked by the United
States for 35 years with tacit European
acceptance I've mentioned some of the
reasons a contempt for the worthless
victims is no small part of the barrier
to achieving a settlement with at least
a modicum of justice and respect for
human dignity and rights it's not beyond
imagination that the barrier can be
overcome that'll take dedicated work as
has happened in other cases on Iran I'd
like to suggest the U of you not
familiar with it a fine talk by Jon Snow
about a year ago at the Chatham House so
those Iran very well he had much of
interest to say his main point was that
the West must overcome its contempt for
Iran and its people
he ended the talk by calling for esteem
esteem esteem which is respect around
its history its civilization while also
making it quite clear that
we condemn its government we should
engage with Iran by trade the cultural
interchange other measures he brings up
one highly successful case a cooperative
exhibition of Iranian artistic treasures
by the British Museum and Iran which is
another example more recent there was an
International Congress in Teheran last
October on hiv/aids American scientists
participated just a couple weeks ago
with the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of
science main scientific organization the
u.s. participants in the Tehran
conference described Iran as a model for
the rest of the region in its response
to AIDS and added that we can learn a
lot from what Iranians are doing or
could they add if it weren't for the
fact that these efforts are now being
severely undermined by the harsh
sanctions but the most coming back to
snow is the most important step he
emphasized would be to overcome the
contempt that has guided the West for a
century it's primarily Britain the
United States since it largely replaced
Britain in 1953 when the two overthrew
the parliamentary government installed
the harsh tyranny of the Shah I will
review the disgraceful record of
contempt and purposeful humiliation
actually explored in depth in a new book
the first the best scholarly study of
the coup there about abrahama ins very
revealing works it's just appeared it
should evoke shame and deep regret in
Britain in the United States and we
should also remember that in the last 60
years not a single day has passed when
the US and Britain were not brutally
punished
Iranians at first by installing and
backing the Shah than by supporting
Saddam Hussein's aggression then our
sanctions now the open threat of war
which is a violation of the UN Charter
and a sentimentalists about you care the
current issue is Iran's nuclear programs
interesting to ask who shares the
Western perception that's the obsession
that this is the greatest threat to
world peace and that questions are easy
to answer the obsession is not shared by
the non-aligned countries it's most of
the world they continue their vigorous
support outspoken support for Iran's
right to enrich uranium as signers of
the non-proliferation treaty it's not
shared in the Arab world where the
population dislikes --red for all kind
of reasons that go way back but does not
consider it much of a threat now the
population does perceive threats
primarily Israel in the United States
the people I'm talking about Western
commentary keeps to the oil dictators
who do see Iran is a threat this helps
explain why the West is so opposed to
democracy in the Arab world they had any
disregarding the usual boilerplate if
you have some kind of functioning
democracy public opinion has some sort
of influence on policy and the last
thing that the West wants is for policy
to focus on the threats that are
perceived of us and Israel and not on
the threat that the West is obsessed
with the alleged threat of Iran well
secondly whatever the threats alleged to
be is there a way to address it a short
of sanctions that punish the population
and war well there are a number of
possibilities
one approach would be to revive the try
to revive the Terran agreement of May
2010 then Tehran Iran accepted a Turkish
Brazilian proposal to send a low
enriched uranium for storage abroad in
Turkey and that have the nuclear powers
and satisfy REMS needs for needs for its
medical reactors the US government and
the media bitterly condemned Turkey in
Brazil for overcoming the greatest
threat to world peace and Obama quickly
rushed through new sanctions at the
United Nations the u.s. refused to
accept yes for an answer is putting
Mohamed ElBaradei the former head of the
International Atomic Energy Agency the
Brazilian foreign minister was rather
annoyed by this and he released a letter
from Obama to president Lula da Silva of
Brazil proposing exactly to what Turkey
and Brazil had achieved presumably Obama
was assuming that Iran would reject the
proposal and get some propaganda points
the incident was glossed over rather
quietly but the option may remain one of
several and there's also a broader
approach to the problem which is worth
thinking seriously about it was
vigorously it's it was actually proposed
by the non-aligned conference that met
in Tehran last August it renewed
long-standing proposal
which has been vigorously advanced by
Egypt in particular for many years and
has such overwhelming international
support that Washington has been
compelled to express its formal
agreement but only formal reservations
that had can't do it it's also supported
by some of the most prominent US and
Israeli strategic analysts that proposal
would be to establish to move towards
establishing a nuclear weapons free zone
in the region if even steps were taken
towards that it would mitigate whatever
crisis is perceived might be a way to
end them well an opportunity to carry
forward the program arose last December
an international conference was to be
held in Finland to move towards
implementation under UN auspices in
November Iran agreed to attend a few
days later Obama canceled the conference
the core issue of course is that the US
will not allow Israel's nuclear weapons
to be subject to inspection or even
discussion well a few days after Obama
cancelled the conference of the UN
General Assembly passed a resolution
that calling on Israel to join the
non-proliferation treaty 174 to 6
joining Israel in voting know where the
United States Canada several US Pacific
island dependencies I didn't check but I
suspect that Britain abstained the u.s.
then proceeded to carry out a nuclear
weapons test once again banning
international inspectors from the test
site shortly after that a meeting took
place under the auspices of
the Washington Institute for Near East
policy some offshoot of the Israeli
Lobby the press likes to pretend that
they're independent experts the there
was an enthusiastic report in the
Israeli press it said that Dennis Ross
Elliott Abrams of other former top
advisors to Obama and Bush assured the
audience that the president coding at
the president will strike Iran next year
if diplomacy doesn't succeed well one
reason why diplomacy won't succeed is
that there's no protest against what's
happening and there can't be that can't
be any protest for the failure of
diplomacy or efforts to seek the yet to
end the greatest threat to world peace
for a very simple reason hardly a word
about these recent events in fact
virtually nothing has been reported in
the United States so another interesting
illustration of how free speech can be
restricted in a very free society with
essentially no government coercion
I haven't investigated but I suspect
that the same is true here you can tell
me there are other possibilities that
none can be seriously pursued unless the
powerful are capable of learning to
respect the dignity of their victims if
this is beyond their means impassable
barriers will remain and the world will
be doomed to violence cruelty and bitter
suffering
