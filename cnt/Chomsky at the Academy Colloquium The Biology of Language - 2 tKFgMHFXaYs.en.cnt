hitters including historians of
linguistics sometimes observe that there
is little reference to evolution of
language in the early literature of
generative grammar that's quite correct
but the reasons are apparently not
understood the topic was much discussed
from the early 1950s later by Leno
burger and in scientific conferences but
for the reasons mentioned there could be
fused substantive conclusions hence few
references by the by the early 1990s
there was contrary to the standard story
a little quoting again little
respectable new scientific information
relevant to the evolution of language to
be synthesized nor were there
intellectual roadblocks to be demolished
but several changes did take place the
one change is what I mentioned progress
in the study of ug raised the
possibility that something like smt
might be correct that suggested that a
major barrier to the study of evolution
of language might be overcome a second
development was the appearance of a very
important paper by evolutionary
biologist Richard lewontin who explained
in some detail why it would be next to
impossible to study the evolution of
cognition language in particular by any
approach currently understood and the
third a change was the beginning of the
vast outpouring of papers and books on
evolution of language all ignoring Lou
Anton's careful and I think persuasive
arguments much to their detriment and my
onion and almost always avoiding the
advances in understanding of ug that
open the way to at least some
investigation of the topic in fact a
common conclusion is that ug does not
exist because you g is dead as Michael
Tomasello puts it if that's the case
then there is no topic of evolution of
ug of course that is no topic of
evolution of language in the only
coherent sense rather emergence of
language reduces to evolution of
cognitive processes that we cannot be
seriously investigated for the reasons
that the one discussed so end of
discussion it's also necessary to ignore
the substantial evidence on dissociation
of language capacity from other
cognitive processes as in fact is
commonly done it's also necessary to
ignore the uniqueness of ug to humans
the fact which is evident from the first
moment of birth so a newborn human
infant instantly selects from the
environment language related data which
is no trivial feat an ape with
approximately the same auditory system
here is only noise the human infant then
proceeds on a systematic course of
acquisition that is unique to humans and
that demonstrably goes beyond far beyond
what any general learning mechanism can
provide that's true from word learning
to syntactic structure and semantic
interpretation the huge growth of a
field that barely exists that raises
some
interesting questions about sociology of
science I'll put them aside here and
turn to what seems to me to be a
productive approach to the questions
that arise emphasizing that this is very
far from a consensus view and that of
course it is speculative for the ones
reasons so let's proceed nevertheless to
the extent that smt holds we can at
least formulate the problem of evolution
of the capacity of language in a
coherent way well if it does not we
cannot formulate the problem let's then
ask what conclusions about language and
it's evolution would arise insofar as
something like smt holds well every
computational system has embedded within
it somewhere that operation that applies
to two objects called amex and y which
have already been constructed and
constructs from them a new object call
it Z that's the essence of computation
call this operation merge smt dictates
that merge will be as simple as possible
that means it will not modify x and y
while constructing z nor will it impose
any arrangement on them in particular it
will leave them on order it's an
important fact to it's all return it
follows from that that merge is simply
set formation the merge of x and y
yields the set containing x and y but we
can think of the computational processes
operating like this there's a workspace
which has access to the lexicon of
atomic elements and which contains any
new object that's constructed to carry a
computation forward an element
is selected from the workspace then a
second element Y is selected x and y can
be two distinct elements selected from
the workspace as for example when read
and books are merged to form the
syntactic object underline the phrase
read books that's called external merge
the other possible alternative the only
possible alternative is that one of X
and Y is part of the other it's called
internal merge an example would be when
the phrase he will read which books is
merged with the phrase which books
within it to yield which books he will
read which books which underlies the
sentence which books will he read by
other rules that's an example of the
ubiquitous property of displacement
found everywhere in all the languages of
phrases being pronounced in one place
and interpreted both there and in
another place it had long been supposed
by me in particular that displacement is
a very strange imperfection of language
on the contrary turns out that it's an
automatic property of a very elementary
computational process of the most
elementary one that can be conceived so
to repeat merge of he will read which
books and which books yields which books
he will read which books that has two
occurrences of which books the reason is
that merge doesn't change the merged
elements it's optimal that turns out to
be a very important fact this copy
property of internal merge accounts for
the interpretation of sentences with
displacement so that we understand the
sentence which book will he read to me
something like for which books x he will
read the books X with the phrase which
books assigned semantic roles in two
distinct positions and in fact quite
complex properties of sentence
interpretation to fall out at once from
these optimal assumptions about
computation so let me illustrate with a
very simple example consider the
sentence the boys expect to meet each
other it means each of the boys expects
to meet the other boys suppose we embed
the sentence in the context I wonder who
that yields I wonder who the boys expect
to meet each other the former
interpretation of disappears I hear the
phrase each other refers back to the
remote element who not the proximal
element the boys in I wonder who the
boys expect to meet each other the
reason is that for the mind though not
the ear the proximal element really is
who in the mental expression I wonder
who the boys expect who to meet each
other thanks to the copy property of
internal merge to take a more complex
example that consider the sentence which
one of the paintings did the gallery
expect that every artist likes best the
answer can be his first one different
for every artist the quantified phrase
every artist binds the pronoun is in the
phrase which one of his paintings though
an interpretation like that is not
possible in the structurally very
similar sentence one of his paintings
persuaded the gallery that every artist
likes flowers the reason is
the copy property of internal merge of
displacement what the mind receives is
which one of his paintings did the
gallery expect that every artist likes
which one of his paintings best that's a
normal configuration for binding by the
quantifier as in every artist likes his
first painting best and as sentence
complexity increases there are many
intricate consequences clearly none of
this can be possibly learned by
induction statistical analysis of big
data other general mechanisms that are
fashionable today but the results do
follow in a rich variety of cases from
the fundamental architecture of language
assuming smt well if both of the copies
were pronounced in examples such as
these perceptions would be much easier
in fact one of the main problems faced
in schizophr programs of machine parsing
interpretation one of the main problems
is to find the unpronounceable tiller
gaps problem filler gap problems and
there's a good computational reason why
only one of the copies is pronounced to
pronounce more of them and there could
be several would yield enormous
computational complexity in all but the
very simplest cases so we therefore have
a conflict between computational
efficiency and efficiency of use and
computational efficiency wins hands down
universally in all languages as far as
is known this is true of all
constructions in all languages there's
no time to go into it here but there are
many other cases of
titian conflict between computational
efficiency and efficiency of use
possibility in kitchen and soul in all
known cases efficiency of use is
sacrificed the language design keeps to
computational efficiency and these
examples are by no means margin the case
just discussed for example is the core
problem of possibility and perception
well these results suggest strongly that
language evolved for thought and
interpretation that it's fundamentally a
system of meaning that would mean that
Aristotle's classic dictum that
languages sound with meaning should
actually be reversed the languages
meaning with sound or some other
externalization or none at all and the
concept with is richly significant
externalization at the sensorimotor
level then appears to be an ancillary
process reflecting properties of the
sensory modality that's used in fact
there are different arrangements for
sign and speech it would also follow
that the modern doctrine and it is
modern that communication is somehow the
function of language is mistaken and
that a traditional conception of
language as an instrument of thought is
more nearly correct in a fundamental way
the language apparently really is a
system of audible signs for thought and
whitney's words if he's expressing a
traditional view the modern conception
that communication is the function of
language whatever that is supposed to
mean which is not very clear that
probably derives from the mistaken
belief that somehow language must have
evolved from animal communication though
evolution
biology supports no such conclusion as
lenna Berg already showed half a century
ago and the available evidence is
strongly against it in virtually every
important respect from word meaning to
the basic property in acquisition and
use language apparently human language
appears to be radically different from
systems of animal communication lending
support to Lenna Berg's dissociation
'used CSIS one might suspect that the
modern conception also derives from
lingering behaviorist tendencies which
have a little merit in my opinion
whatever the reasons the evidence
available seems to me strongly favored
the traditional view that language is
fundamentally a system of thought and
there is substantial further evidence
for this conclusion notice again that
the optimal operation optimal
computational operation merge imposes no
border on the merged elements so it
follows then that the mental operations
involving language should be independent
of order which is order should be simply
a reflex of the sensory motor system we
have to impose linear order on words
when we speak of the sensory motor
system apparently was substantially in
place long before language emerged and
it appears to have little to do with
language it does not permit production
in parallel or production of structures
but that limitation seems to have
nothing to do with language only with
the sensorimotor this particular
sensorimotor modality actually it is
different if the modality assign and as
earlier the apes that have approximately
the same auditory system as humans here
only noise when languages produced
though a newborn instant instantly
infant instantly extracts language
relevant data from the busy environment
using the unique human language faculty
which is much more deeply embedded in
the brain that some illustrations of
these conclusions are quite familiar so
for example languages differ and whether
they have verb object or object verb
constructions but the language is
assignment the identical semantic roles
independently of the order then the
conclusions appear to generalize far
beyond these observations have some
quite interesting empirical consequences
the bearing on puzzles that arose of 60
years ago so consider the sentence birds
that fly instinctively swim or the
sentence the desire to fly instinctively
appeals to children now these sentences
are ambiguous the adverb instinctively
can be associated with the previous verb
fly instinctively or the following one
instinctively swim or instinctively
appeals suppose now that we extract the
adverb from the sentences forming
instinctively birds that fly swim
instinctively the desire to fly the
fields to children and now the ambiguity
is eliminated the adverb is construed
only with the remote verb swim or
appeals not with the proximal verb fly
these facts are one illustration of a
universal property of language is the
property of structure dependence of
rules
the computational rules of language
ignore the very simple property of
linear distance and keep to the much
more complex property of structural
distance that's a puzzle the strange
puzzle it was noticed long ago when the
earliest efforts were made to construct
precise parameters there have been many
attempts to show that the consequences
can be derived from data and experience
in fact this is the major case by far
with in computational cognitive science
of an effort to deal with some
non-trivial property of language all
efforts fail totally and it's obvious
why in cases like the one I mentioned
there simply is no data the child has no
evidence at all to show that the simple
property of linear distance must be
ignored in favor of the complex property
of structural distance that nevertheless
experiment by Steve crane shows that
children understand that they understand
that rules our structure dependent as
early as they can be tested by about age
three and do not make effort errors and
of course I'm not instructed all of this
follows at once if we assume that smt
holds that the computations of language
are as simple as possible and there is
no other explanation offered the failed
efforts there are many have kept two
auxiliary inversion and two relative
clauses which were indeed the earliest
cases discussed this artificial
limitation misled researchers into
believing that the phenomenon might have
something to do with raising rules or
that there might be data available to
the child or that the phenomenon might
have something
to do with presupposed information in
relative clauses among the many
proposals made that even in these terms
the efforts are a complete failure but
when we move beyond the earliest
illustrations to rules of control such
as those I mentioned which behave in
exactly the same way it becomes entirely
clear that all of the efforts and the
literature totally beside the point so
again there is a very simple explanation
for the puzzling phenomenon furthermore
the only explanation that survives
inspection the results follow from the
optimal assumption about the nature of
ug the strong minimalist thesis as Mt
while some researchers have at least
tried to account for the phenomenon
others fail to understand that it's a
puzzle at all one example is FJ Neumeier
linguist historian of linguistics he
supposes he proposes quoting him that
structure dependence of rules follows
from design pressures to make all
information bearing complex systems
structure hierarchies there are in fact
far simpler and more persuasive reasons
why a computational procedure yields
structured hierarchies but that fact
leaves the puzzle unchanged both
structured hierarchy and linear order
clearly exists the puzzle is why the
simple computational operation of
shortest linear distance is universally
ignored in favor of the more complex
operation of shortest structural
distance doesn't help to say that
structured hierarchy is available so is
linear order available plainly
incidentally this is a rather common
error a right to technical
appearing in the current literature and
incidentally on the side it's only one
of the series of errors that render this
particular article irrelevant to its
goal of refuting earlier versions of
arguments related to those I'm reviewing
here the errors that also undermine
conclusions drawn by other authors in
the curious volume on evolution of
language in which it appears the one I
cited earlier and the word curious is
indeed appropriate the
misinterpretations that appear there and
elsewhere are sometimes curious indeed
that one is the confusion between
evolution and natural selection which
are of course distinct natural selection
is a factor in evolution as Darwin
stressed not the factor other errors are
stranger still so gene HSN and the same
volume discusses what she calls the pop
hypothesis that language might have
popped into existence relatively fast
and to illustrate the absurdity of this
hypothesis she cites my reference to the
idea that half a wing is not useful for
flying failing to mention however that I
brought this up as a fallacy and went on
and the following sentences to cite a
recent technical publication proposing
that insect wings evolved in turn
initially as thermo regulators and were
then accepted for flying a regretted
regrettably these are not exceptions in
the literature on evolution of the
language but I want Terry on that matter
here well returning to the main topic
it's also of some significance i think
that the apparent variety and complexity
of language
and its susceptibility to change lie
mostly and perhaps even entirely in the
process of external ization not in the
systems that generate the underlying
expressions and provide them to the
conceptual interface for other mental
operations these appear to be virtually
uniform among languages and if that
turns out to be true which increasingly
seems to be the case would not roll be
surprising because the child receives
virtually no evidence about as in the
simple case as I mentioned no evidence
at all in cases like these and the facts
become much more dramatic as we turn to
examples of normal complexity there's
also both neurological evidence and some
evolutionary evidence to support the
conclusion about the ancillary character
of externalization in one or another
modality and hence about the ancillary
character of use of language for
communication and other forms of
interchange research conducted in milan
decade ago initiated by aundrea Mauro
showed that nonsense systems keeping 2ug
principles elicit normal activation in
the language areas of the brain but much
simpler nonsense systems using linear
order in violation of ug you'll diffuse
activation implying that subjects are
treating them as a puzzle and not as a
nonsense language there's confirming
evidence by neil smith and ii on Theed
simply in their investigation of a
cognitively deficient but linguistically
gifted subject and smith and simply also
made the interesting of the vey
that normals can solve the problem if
it's presented to them as a puzzle but
not if it's presented to them as a
language of presumably activating the
language faculty these studies suggest
some very intriguing paths that can be
pursued in neuroscience and experimental
psycholinguistics well to summarize
briefly the optimal conclusions about
the nature of language would be that its
basic principles are extremely simple
perhaps even optimal for computational
systems that was in fact the goal that
has been sought since the earliest study
of generative grammar in the mid 20th
century it seemed completely
unattainable in earlier years but much
less out of reach today and from that
optimal assumption some quite
interesting empirical conclusions follow
for one we see that displacement far
from being a puzzling anomaly in fact is
an expected property of a perfectly
designed language it would be would be
more complex if it didn't exist
furthermore optimal design yields the
copy property of displacement with quite
rich and complex consequences for
semantic interpretation we also have an
immediate explanation for the very
puzzling fact that language ignores
simple properties of linear order and
uniformly relies on the more complex
property of structural distance in all
languages in all constructions again of
course without data for the child we
also have an explanation for the
apparent fact that the diversity
complexity and malleability of the
language subject to change is mostly may
be entirely localized
in an external system that is ancillary
to the core internal properties of
language structure and semantic
interpretation if all of this is correct
we see that language is well designed
for computational efficiency an
expression of thought but prose opposes
serious problems for use in particular
for communication language is in essence
an instrument of thought as
traditionally assumed now of course the
term designed as a metaphor what it
means is that the simplest evolutionary
process consistent with the basic
property of human language yields a
system of thought and understanding
computationally efficient since there
were no external pressures preventing
this optimal outcome well returning to
the two facts of evolutionary history
one firm the other reasonable a
plausible speculation is that some small
rewiring of the brain within that narrow
evolutionary window provided the core
element of the basic property namely an
optimal computational procedure which
yields an infinite array of
hierarchically structured expressions
each interpreted systematically at the
conceptual interface with other
cognitive systems that's different from
the way I formulated the basic property
before keeping to the conceptual
interface in fact it's not easy to
conceive of a different possibility
different coherent possibility since
there can't be a series of small steps
that leads to infinite yield that's a
logical impossibility a mutation of
course takes place in an individual not
in a group an individual and down with
this small rewiring it would have
advantage
his capacity to think and plan and so on
and the capacity might proliferate
through a small breeding group over
generations at some point
externalization would be useful but it
poses heart cognitive problems a system
designed for computational efficiency
must be mapped to a sensory motor system
that's quite independent of it that
problem can be solved in many ways of
course with constraints yielding
superficial variety and complexity and
perhaps involving no evolution at all
could be just a cognitive problem now
that fits pretty well with what we
observe and it seems to me the most
parsimonious explanation a speculation
though of course it is a speculation for
de Colombes reasons well needless to say
these remarks only scratch the surface
there is recent work exploring the SMT
and new and I think promising directions
and quite naturally a vast array of
phenomena that have been unearthed about
language remain barely examined
unexplained but the picture that I
sketched here seems to me the most
plausible one that we have and one that
offers many opportunities for fruitful
research and inquiry
thank you much no and actually many of
the people that you mentioned like
Stephen Crane and neil smith and an
jamora are all here today so the talk is
open for questions who can I give the
microphone don't be shy here's the
microphone so to come say fitch would
like to ask her purse I know my don't
know if you can see on here but we can
see you so I just said actually but I
can't hear we're going you cannot hear
can I can hear but my hearing is not
great but ok I'll try and speak very
clearly I have to to clarification
questions about the copy principle of
internal merge these are just the naive
biologists not understanding so in your
example where we have he which books
will he will read which books and you
merge that with which books the copy
principle that you told us about
explains why we don't hear which books
taste when we output we the we only hear
that the first time so that gives us
which books he will read but we still
have this inversion in English which
books will he read that's what we
actually say in English so there's
something else that happens there is
that where and what's the explanation
for that well the the optimal
computation tells us two things first it
tells us that the copy theory the copy
property holds that is what reaches the
mind is which books he hears which books
because merge being optimal doesn't
delete either of them it also tells us
why what reaches the ear drops one of
the two namely that to keep both with
you computational complexity now you're
pointing out that there are other
rules involved like the rule of
inversion so why do we say will he
instead of he will actually we can make
up examples in which there's no
inversion just to make it look simpler
so if we said I wonder which books he
will read which books that's what would
reach the mind what would reach the ear
would be I wonder which books he will
read and there's no inversion okay the
inversion holds only in what's called a
matric sentence that you know the top
sentence not in embedded sentences and
the reason for that is a phenomenon that
appears in many languages of raising of
the verbal element to a second position
in the in the matrix sentence in the
full in the external part of the total
sentence it's another rule then left
abstract away from that to see the way
the copy properties working if we take
embedded cases like a guess which book
he reads or under which book you reads
we don't have that extra complication
does that respond to the query it does
but it still begs the question that I
really want to know which is is that
extra inversion that you're talking
about is that done as part of external
ization or is there a part or is it a
different versions of internal merge or
who does it well actually that's an
important question and not a trivial one
and much contested the usual way I the
usual way of looking at this is that the
inflectional element to which a verb is
attached is a joint raises to the second
position I think that's a mistake I
think actually this has to do with the
nature of what's called head movement my
own view it's discussed in a recent
paper which still isn't out that's work
a lot of you have seen is that head
movement has been misinterpreted head
movement has always been in
as the as if the raised element adjoins
to the element to which it attaches but
I think it's pretty clearly the other
way around the Rays del the element to
which it attaches is joined to the
raised element so when you raise verb to
inflection the result is not an
inflection with a verb a joint to it
it's a verb with an inflection a joint
to it and the same and that means that
the raising from T what's usually call T
the inflectional element to see the
second position complan ties a position
is actually very zhing it's not
inflection raising the verb raising is
something that happens in all kinds of
languages German Dutch others and it's
probably the same thing in English not
inflection to complement Iser but just
normal for brazing that's a not the
usual view of incidentally that's it no
it isn't even in the literature up until
an unpublished paper of mine which
coming in ok thanks my second question
about the copy principle is why would it
be so computationally inefficient or so
computationally expensive to simply
pronounced the whole thing it just
doesn't seem like it would be
computationally expensive it would make
long sentences they'd be kind of Adwords
but that seems like that would be a
small price to pay so why it's a
computational expansion well you have to
think about the externalization process
which includes morphology phonology and
phonetics right if you have a phrase
like save the which picture of the
artist and you have to articulate it you
have to go through all the computations
of morphology and phonology all inside
the mind and ultimately the articulatory
motions and that's a huge computational
problem especially because it can appear
over and over and these phrases remember
can be of arbitrary complexity so it
could be which picture of the
artist that he painted last year while
he was in England to run through best
leaf ontological and morphological
operations that yield the narrow
phonetics is a huge amount of
computation and that can't remember in
remember of coal of course that this is
also successive cyclic movement so these
things appear at many points in the
utterance that's an enormous
computational burden and it's in
addition it's an enormous articulatory
version in addition to the internal
computation so I think there's a very
strong computational reason why only one
is pronounced the question that arises
which one will there are three
possibilities it could be you know the
top one could be the bottom one or could
be one of the medial ones in reality
what we hear is either the lowest one
which is called in in situ language or
the highest one which is like English
although English also has nc2
constructions those are the two things
that appear as possibilities what is not
a possibility is leaving it in them
leaving the WH fairies in the middle now
it can't appear in the middle in like
after a word like wonder but it can't
appear in the middle in a declarative
embedded sentence although there's very
strong reason to believe that it appears
there and then comes the question well
why can't it appear in the middle
actually I think this is an I've
suggested in what seems to be an
interesting answer to that I can't talk
about it here some of you know about it
in terms of what's called labeling
theory the theory of how phrase does get
identified for semantic and phonological
interpretation that appears in a
discussed in a paper that appeared in
lingua journal lengua about a year ago
called problems of projection and
there's a lot of further work on this
topic by reading point versus their
other
but that's that's basically the story
right I thanks against thank you all the
questions yes villarama so thank you
very much Williams item are from
Amsterdam so as one of James her efforts
former students I was hoping I could ask
you a question about that that's
scenario you presented at which the end
and I think I I think that that sounds
plausible as you were saying but you
would eat at some point so if I answered
it right you're saying like merge
appears in an individual manages to
spread in a population and then the
solution of the of how the interface
constraints are are solved basically and
that can be that can work out in all
kinds of different ways I hope I
understood that right but that process
of sort of working out all of those that
interface business that is that
happening in just ahead of one single
individual or is that a process that
unfolds over several generations where
so something that Jim erfurt and i would
call cultural evolution might play some
role or I don't see why don't see why
that wouldn't be a helpful addition to
the scenario well I'm uncomfortable
about the phrase cultural evolution
because I think the term i prefer at
least personally to take the term
evolution much more seriously and
restricted to biological objects there
definitely is cultural change okay but i
think it's confusing to describe it as
evolution is no similarity to biological
evolution but that's a terminological
point i think what you read the question
you bring up the race is very serious
issues first of all notice that there
are two questions about connection to
interface interfaces one question is how
let's say merge evolves an individual
okay that individual can then construct
an indefinite number of an arbitrary
number of hierarchically structured
expressions but to be at all useful to
the individual it has to link to the
conceptual interface okay how does that
happen that's total mystery that goes
back to the mystery that i mentioned at
the beginning about the total mystery of
how the atomic elements of the
computation emerged the simplest words
of human language you know the river
tree person you name it all have the
property do not have the referential
estea they do not link to extra mental
entities contrary to animal
communication where that linkage seems
to be universal this cuz i mentioned
goes back to the pre-socratics who
raised questions like this about river
Aristotle discussed the question of use
the example of house the early modern
philosophers 17th 18th century locked
Hume and others that we're concerned
with many examples including a crucial
one person and so on most of this has
been forgotten but it's very important
and it relates to the first part of the
linkage to the conceptual interface
somehow we don't know how these atomic
elements emerged in human evolutionary
history they have to be used by the
computational process and the that means
that the result that the expression that
is created by the by the process must
have an interpretation at the thought
interface well going back to your
question that has to happen in
individual the first individual for whom
system was at all useful actually it's
perfectly conceivable that endless
numbers of times in the prehistory of
humans merge appeared but was never
linked to anything so it's not a wood it
died out because it would had no use you
know just kind of like an accidental
development that disappears that's quite
possible and maybe it even though I
don't know of any evidence for it exists
in some other organisms but it is not
linked to anything so therefore just
dies out the linkage to the sensorimotor
interface i think is quite different the
what of the speculation that I'm
proposing is that merge linked to the
conceptual interface using the atoms
which are a mystery appeared in a single
individual that's almost a logical
necessity so I think we can safely
assume that possibly it could have
proliferated in since its genetic
property it could have proliferated to
future generations some of them at some
point a number that remember we're
talking about small breeding groups a
number of people in that reading group
would have had the internal capacity and
at that point it becomes useful to
interact with it but how do you do it
you have to solve problem of how to map
this internal system which may satisfy
smt to a sensory motor system which has
been around for hundreds of thousands of
years and has nothing
do with it that mapping is complex and
in fact what we discover is I think that
overwhelmingly and may be completely the
complexity variety malleability of
language lies in that part of the system
in the morphology phonology phonetics
that's what you learn when you learn a
second language when you learn a second
language you don't learn structure
dependence you don't learn the copy
property nobody's ever learned that if I
nobody even noticed until recently what
you learn is the phonetics the
phenomenology the irregular irregular
verbs some facts about word order things
like that which are all acting part of
the externalization so how would that
change develop well you know through
interaction among people of the nature
of the culture would have an effect
there could be cultural processes that
lead it to develop one way or another as
I said I would prefer not to call them
evolution but that's terminological
that's the speculation that I proposing
does that has that respond to the
question okay thanks very much the next
question is from bart de Bourgh so it's
in a sense of follow-up to what the
other just asked but it has to do with
the timing of the biological evolution
and I find your argument if language
evolved late the cognitive changes must
have been simple very persuasive but
then we do find evidence of a fair
amount of adaptation in the
externalization system as well so for
instance are our sensitivity our infants
sensitivity like to language that you
mentioned must have evolved as well um
so I'm sorry what what is it must've you
know the sensitivity for speech for
the capacity for speech yeah and and the
capacity to learn it um so my worry is
aren't you shifting the whole problem by
saying well because we've had there's
this there's been very little time for
length to evolve but then all of this
complexity all these biological
adaptations to externalization must now
have evolved in the last say seventy
five thousand years as well so I'm not
convinced that they've evolved at all
they developed but it doesn't follow
that they evolved let's use the term
evolution in its literal sense genomic
change basically it's not clear that
that's involved in the say ability to
pronounce or let's take the ability to
use x which is pretty much common to
humans and apes and as we know sine
works strike two dramatically like
spoken language to find it and children
acquire sign language in the same at the
same rate at the same stages and so on
as spoken languages you know babbling
the interchange of pronouns you know in
first and second pronoun and roughly
fifteen months of age the structures and
so on looks like the same process and
it's using a modality which it may have
very early evolutionary origins pretty
much common destinations as far as the
articulatory mechanisms are concerned
I'm past it been speculation about you
know lower into the larynx and so on and
so forth but I think it's pretty weak I
don't think it in it gives strong
evidence that any of this evolved
co-evolved with language it probably is
just there because that's the way that
for whatever reason it developed and
then it's taken over it's appropriate
for external ization when that process
when the mapping from the internal
mental system to the sensory motor
systems undertaken and in many different
ways I mean not you know there are
constraints of course but we find the
fair variety of phonetic outputs in
languages across the world and sign is
entirely different in fact as we know it
can even be the modality that's used can
even be touch you know the Helen Keller
type case so it's pretty likely that any
sensory modality is available for humans
that we can't use smell because it's
just too primitive maybe dogs could you
smell but we humans can use sound sight
and touch at least and none of which at
least sign and touch certainly didn't go
evolve with language ok thank you very
much the next question is from Eden
tattersall oh hello yes I'm in terrace
all I'm a paleontologist and first of
all I like to say I really liked a lot
what you said about the evolutionary
process and particularly about the
dangers of conflating evolution and
natural selection and I think there is a
pretty simple solution to this matter
that we've just been discussing the
anatomical species Homo sapiens came
into existence about 200,000 years ago
but the real inflection in the
complexity of behavior as we see it in
the archaeological record occurred just
in that time scale that you were talking
about a hundred thousand 75,000 years
ago by which time everything must have
been in place the the obvious point at
which both the at which the
computational ability was achieved
presumably was that enormous
mental event when Homo sapiens as a as a
anatomically recognizable and highly
derived species came into existence
around 200,000 years ago and it was this
new capacity simply lay fallow for a
hundred thousand years until it was
recruited by some behavioral means
possibly the adoption of language and at
that point of course the the peripheral
structures that allow the
externalization of speech the
sensorimotor structures would already
have been in place as they would have
been since the birth of the species
itself so I don't think we have a
problem in matching the two things
because that make sense the yarn em
actually just side comment the reason
why I'm suggesting that the reason why
we were agreeing on what the probable
range is because is because i'm quoting
you you know it's so so that accounts
for the agreement there are there is a
possibility different there as far as i
can see there are two possibilities we
can imagine i would describe it a little
bit differently than you did that one is
the one I mentioned that say you know
75,000 years ago something like that a
mutation caused the rewiring of the
brain an individual yielding kind of a
language of thought and at some point in
the following years the problem the
externalization was faced that's one
possibility another possibility is what
you suggested if I understand it
correctly that 200,000 years ago this
mutation and rewiring took place along
with the linkage to the conceptual
structure so that the individuals the
individual involved in any future
generations had a system of thought but
that it wasn't until
seventy-five thousand years ago that
they began to externalize it okay that's
another puppy that it lay fallow if you
like that's possible all of this is pure
speculation so but as far as I can see
those are the only two a third
possibility is that somewhere in the
middle maybe you know 120,000 years ago
this event took place after the species
was established this event took place in
the brain I think there is some evidence
for marine expansion around 100,000
years or so so maybe something took
place then and then lay fallow until it
began to be externalized the question
really is the this creative leap that
you discuss in your articles in recent
book say around 75,000 years is that
connected to the externalization of the
system or is it connected to the origin
of the system and I don't see any way to
settle there oh I think that's a very
excellent question and one that we're
not really Don position is settle the
thing that strikes to me though is that
Homo sapiens is incredibly derived we
have a lot of knowledge of the primitive
of body form of of the genus Homo and i
think the the Neanderthals are pretty
good exemplar of this and and Homo
sapiens is the antithesis of that very
robust that very broad you know broad
pelvis conical thorax kind of anatomy
there was a major major developmental
reorganization at the at the origin of
Homo sapiens and it seems to me to make
sense to to link a lot of these these
changes we're talking about to that one
event at which
sapiens came into existence which would
have been we think around 200,000 years
ago yeah I think it makes some sense but
it also makes sense to suppose that the
changes in the archaeological record
that you've discussed say say around so
