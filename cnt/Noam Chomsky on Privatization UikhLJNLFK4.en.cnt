there's a standard way of privatizing
something like when Margaret Thatcher
wanted to privatize the British
railroads the technique was defund them
and then when they don't work people get
angry and say let's do something so you
hand it over to private enterprise which
totally ruins them and then the state
has to come back in because and try to
reconstruct it so now it's known as
privatization the the and that's exactly
what's happening with Social Security
it's in good shape now when you read in
the newspapers as you do that the big
problem of the deficit is entitlements
and Social Security you Medicare or
Medicaid Social Security is your problem
for I think it doesn't add anything to
the deficit because people pay for it
and for another thing it's in pretty
good shape
certainly well very the last of the
famous baby boomers will be gone before
there's any problem in it that's why
there's a big payroll tax increase
thirty years ago to ensure that but if
it's defunded it'll be a problem then
they'll be pressure to privatize it
that's a huge bonanza for the financial
institutions it will put trillions of
dollars into their hands which they can
then use to make a ton of money with
risky investments which are therefore
very profitable and when it tanks as it
will when the economy tanks you just
there's a technique you pick up your
copies of Milton Friedman and Hayek and
iron Rand and you run to the nanny state
that you've nurtured you make sure that
they bail you out that's really existing
capitalism and it means that the scam
can go on like take privatizing schools
what's point of privatizing schools well
you know the idea is to instill in
people the idea that all you care about
is yourself
so I don't happen to have children or
school age so therefore according to the
ideology that's implanted in you you're
I'm not supposed to care what
the kid down the street has a school to
go to so I don't want to pay taxes and I
want to cut taxes because I don't care
if that kid goes to school and if you
know some to have enough money I could
send my kid to private school if I
wanted to so cares of their public
schools so we should privatize schools
to eliminate the conception that we
should care if some other kid goes to
school which everybody has you got to
drive it out of their heads the same is
true I don't know if it's happening here
of efforts to privatize pension and
security systems at West Point of that
like in the u.s. these big effort to try
to privatize Social Security I mean
financially speaking it's ridiculous
it's a huge cost and everything else but
there are reasons for it Social Security
is based on an unacceptable principle
namely that each person that you should
care if the disabled Widow across town
survives and you're not supposed to care
about that you're supposed to care about
whether you have enough pairs of shoes
and stuff like them you know enough cars
and video games or whatever it is that's
all you're supposed to care of it so you
got a privatized Social Security also
another advantage to privatizing Social
Security is that it has the brilliant
consequence of turning working people
against their own interests because if
your pension is tied up in stocks you
want to make sure those stocks go up and
the way those stocks go up is by cutting
wages and reducing working conditions
sending jobs to you know Chinese
sweatshops and so on so as a working
person you should you have to be
committed to undermining your own
interests and that's important so for
reasons like that you want to privatize
Social Security and privatize water or
schools and everything else by
definition privatization undercuts
democracy take something out of the
public arena and puts it into the hands
of unaccountable private tyrannies that
are created and supported by the state
which is what corporations are remember
all these privatization you hear about
it's supposed to be very efficient and
by some measure
by some ludicrous measure it probably is
efficient you know and they're part of
the reason why it's efficient is you
don't count the costs okay so like if
you suppose they're talking about
privatizing the MTA around you know the
public transportation thing all right
suppose you privatize the system you and
I know how to make it more efficient by
the economist measures you throw out
union workers and you get temps for half
the price and if there is an accident
because they never had any training well
it's just people are getting killed you
don't measure that and you cut off the
so called unprofitable bus routes okay
or subway where it's like you don't make
a lot of money at 11 p.m. okay so let's
throw them out well suppose somebody's
stuck somewhere at 11 p.m. and wants to
get home oh well you know it's
entrepreneurial values you know let them
hire a limousine or something you know
and in ways like that you can make the
system more efficient simply by
transferring the costs over the public
where you'll measure the costs okay so
it looks nice and efficient on some some
you know some economists paper but of
course you just this huge costs
transferred over the public which you
don't measure
