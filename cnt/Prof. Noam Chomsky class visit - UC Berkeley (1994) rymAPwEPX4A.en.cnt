one and only
I'm a fan and 6/100 I was priced to
learn from your electric you tonight
that that me your syntax is was
developed out of immersive mathematics
and I was really interested that means
I'm said
I was I mean people understood language
really he understood that that language
that the ordinary use of language the
speaker of the language is provided by
an emotional structure which is
unconscious which a lot of scenes of one
of three expressions
the at the time this is the world
rationals
what were your influences and
restrictions it's a very misleading book
because it was not some type of
structure whose undergraduate experience
you know MIT students for coming out of
engineering mathematics things like that
language and so syntactic structures
starts off from where they are
kind of stuff which is - nothing and
then it kind of gradually works up to
but it's a it's been extremely
misleading because that was the only
thing there wasn't that was great
it just went into but that was
unpublished your question it was
unpublishable this was there dealt with
questions which in fact had a
traditional cast though I didn't know
nobody but the only thing that entered
very misleading this along which has to
do with looking at the formal power of
assistants like are these systems to be
rich
[Music]
around
wherever there are major
[Music]
there are
[Music]
the literature is always about what
would get what would it mean it's like
asking what would it mean if an
unstructured system
[Music]
physics what is the stage where people
didn't know big debate about whether
molecules in our real
[Music]
they didn't get words they got pursuit
chemistry and physics and finally to
exchange good enough so you had a basis
or
we have
[Music]
one event has been used by many namely
calling and great and Watson we're able
to reduce a lot of biology
chemistry well that's probably one case
of reduction in the history of science
oh never happens it's have been very
small that is rare and unusual and
exciting and it's left in the imprint of
people's melancholy
it's led to the assumption that the next
big step orderly let's reduce the study
of mine pursue the approaches to bring
into areas of
[Music]
so I don't think there is a mister how
can something as messy as fuel systems
which have properties that's extremely
surprised there's nothing but it's there
overwhelming evidence this thing in the
world interesting problems with
rangeland over there it's like the
problem the physics based century could
account for the backs of
[Music]
it's something else
there's for about four years now
predictions about what's going to happen
six months
somebody figured out
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
now there are there are other
[Music]
and beyond that there's quality space
and if you
furthermore the child comes the language
acquisition with a brain which has a
language faculty and the language
faculty has incited some extremely
specific visual system doesn't require a
structure in this way you have a visual
system because you have genetic
instructions here's the way it's
organized
[Music]
but very marginal
[Music]
in fact many years and the artists of
this the linguists have to be beautiful
and the reason is the language well the
input is solely the only thing that the
child sees is the behavior of people and
therefore investigators transition to
the language the linguist must also
because the language and the solely on
the ager well that translate this and
any other part about so let's let this
thing be an area well the only thing
that should cease so therefore the
embryologist must be inefficient the
embryologist
nothing more than studying it was true
the chicken
there's nobody
[Music]
it's not
then they understand their own language
for signs of analysis but their systems
and their many other their many other
categories of sentences they just can't
well it was an answering your the ring
so here you have the expressions of your
language and then there's some scattered
part which is
language design facility redesign our
theories of language to account for the
market parking works very fast very well
that can't be a criterion for any
parsing it works very badly it's true
that there's a scattered subpart
language for which is easy quick and
that's the question well it may be that
this property values
[Music]
quite the reason for that is the
skeletal system
and if you look at the structure of the
system it's just an engineering trail
and there's no it's good enough to
survive required
[Music]
badly well enough of that so that we can
get by now we use I mean it's even
possible with there's another organism
ground that has the language faculty
exactly like ours except that it's
Borland
so like maybe the reason why you can't
get in but the reason why 8 you can't
use anything remotely language like that
8 is they have a language faculty
exactly like errors but have no access
to
well that's conceivable and in fact it's
even if somebody proposed that
the language must be so just looking at
that's very much like the question of an
embryo it's like a question how come you
but you got to warn link okay suppose
from and everybody's that's because
we're
what's the but there's not enough
information there isn't enough
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
meaning it's time you don't stimulate
[Applause]
[Music]
this assumed that the language factors
like that too and there's some evidence
picked up in 13 so it could be just a
theory the problem with all of those
natural experiments
but the question about the indictments
is not is not debatable
the only question you have a language
faculty transitions it stabilizes at
some point say stabilizes in state
well this is it's like the state of your
business's visual system isn't what you
see this is system which basically
stores information and have to be
accessed it's me it's what stores that's
clear that we need language in a very
specific sense the language of an
individual
like state
[Music]
they
they also language
[Music]
to figure out but some of the things
that could figure out it's not as
barracks maintenance you know what dick
is that you understand the nature of
language it should be able to design
impossible languages which would be
impossible for somebody who has only the
language
