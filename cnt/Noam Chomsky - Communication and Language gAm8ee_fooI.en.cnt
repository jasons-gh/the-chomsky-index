it's another Dogma that language and
communication are about the same thing
but if you think about it it's extremely
employable but for one thing you almost
any behavior you carry out communicate
something a gesture the hairstyle you
know almost anything so sure language
behavior also communicates even the
first of all beyond that almost all
language is not involved in
communication and we all know that I
mean you can't go one minute without
talking to yourself I mean it's it's it
takes a tremendous effort of will not to
be doing whatever you're doing when
what's going on in your head well that's
plainly not communication you're doing
it yourself
that's about 99.9% of the use of
language now in fact when you really
think that's never been investigated but
if you introspect about it as it could
be investigated seriously you know from
kind of third person point of view but
hasn't been so you can only sort of
think about it yourself but I can I tell
you my introspections you can figure out
yours but my introspections are that
when I am thinking in language it's not
really language there's just like an
occasional Wordle little long and I know
what I want to say and then I can
express it somehow some sometimes either
internally or externally but if it's the
same for you then that suggests that
there's some kind of language use going
on in there that isn't even using the
articulated language system and it's
just kind of hovering in there somewhere
occasionally bits and pieces come out
and if you try you can say them to
yourself or say them outside and you
know when you get it right which means
that you must have meant something and
the articulation that you produce can
match what you meant but what you meant
is in some internal language and
furthermore even if you take up if you
look at the part of language very small
part that's external you know like what
we're doing a very small part of that is
communication in a seriousness I'm a lot
of us just setting up social relations
that telling jokes to your friends you
know passing time and it's not
communication in a meaningful sense of
the word communication so I think it's
just a big mistake to identify
communication with language
