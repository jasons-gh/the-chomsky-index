the war and peace report
I'm Amy Goodman with nermeen Shaikh as
we continue our conversation with the
world renowned linguist and dissident
Noam Chomsky we interviewed him Thursday
in Tucson Arizona where he now teaches
at the University of Arizona I asked him
to respond to president Trump's recent
decision to pull out of the INF the
intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty
that landmark nuclear arms pact signed
in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
well the INF treaty was a very important
development you may recall that in that
period in the early and mid 80s the
short this has to do with short-range
nuclear missiles they were being
installed in Western Europe pursing two
missiles in Western Europe which had a
few minutes flight time to Moscow if you
think what that means the Russian
detection systems are first of all far
more primitive than ours but even
sophisticated if they had had
sophisticated detection systems that
would have given them barely a few
minutes warning before a possible heavy
nuclear strike even a decapitation
strike against against Moscow and the
Russians were doing the same they were
building short-term missiles aimed at
your Western Europe noticing not at the
United States this was internal to
Europe short term for short-range
missiles
well the 1987 INF treaty and and that
extreme peril sharply reduced that the
missiles were reduced and so an
important step forward breaking the
treaty reinstates that system now
there's an obvious way to deal with the
problem namely it's called it's kind of
a bad word
may be able to spell it it's called
diplomacy there have been the way to
deal with the problem is quite
straightforward do what has not been
done as yet have technical experts from
both sides on neutral ones investigate
the claims that are being made by both
sides and determine if they're valid and
to the extent that there are negotiate a
way to overcome these violations of the
treaty and then enforce the treaty even
further carry it further we should be a
little moving towards eliminating
nuclear weapons remember that the New
START treaty is coming up for renewal
that's a very important one start has
led to the sharp reduction of nuclear
weapons by no means anywhere near far
enough but nevertheless quite
significant the we should also recall
that Trump's pulling out of the INF
treaty has a precursor namely the
Nuclear Posture review of the Trump
administration which already called for
developing new weapons tactical tactical
nuclear weapons which themselves greatly
increase the threat of possible war a
target of these missiles can't know
whether they're conventional or nuclear
or whether they're short-range or or
much more powerful missiles you have a
few minutes warming time to make these
decisions you look over the history of
the nuclear age and it is practically
miraculous that we've survived this far
there's been case after case where we
came very both so it came very close
to make a decision to launch nuclear
weapons which means basically a
terminating human civilization and
miracles like that can't go on forever
and enhancing the threat is just beyond
insanity ending the INF treaty not only
opens the door for the United States and
Russia to develop more dangerous lethal
weapons but of course for others to join
in as well
greatly increasing the hazard to all of
us and there are diplomatic options that
have not been pursued and they are the
ones that they are the ones that should
be uppermost not vastly endangering
ourselves and everyone else Trump also
brought up the fact that China's not a
partner to the INF you know they're not
well the waited it's because of their
particular geostrategic position and
their defensive posture and in the
Western Eurasia Eastern Eurasia Eastern
Eurasia the so the way to deal with that
problem is to bring them into the treaty
not to break the treaty and greatly
increase the danger to the world we
should bear in mind that the Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists which has established
since 1947 beginning of the nuclear age
it's established a Doomsday Clock where
the minute-hand is a certain distance
from midnight midnight means goodbye
termination of all of us at the
beginning 1947 it was seven minutes to
midnight its oscillated off and back
since in last January after a year of
the Trump administration it moved to two
minutes to midnight that's the closest
it's been to
terminal disaster ever with one
exception 1953 the United States then
the Soviet Union exploded thermonuclear
weapons demonstrating that are in our
ingenuity we had devised the means to
destroy everything at that point the
clock did move to two minutes to
midnight hasn't gone that close to
disaster since but it did last January
and now it's worse the Nuclear Posture
review the revelation since that time
that the u.s. actually has developed the
first strike potential which could
prevent could eliminate any deterrent to
a first strike then Trump's Nuclear
Posture review which calls for extending
the nuclear threat now this latest step
this is a march to disaster which is
only paralleled by the moves of the
administration to race towards the cliff
of environmental destruction with eyes
open they know exactly what they're
doing
Trump himself is a firm believer at
global warming the others as well but
just in order to fill a couple of pocket
overstuffed pockets with more dollars
they're willing to to threaten of the
existence of ordinary of organized human
life there's just no words to describe
these two drives to destruction in
parallel or in fact to describe the fact
that they're barely discussed in the
electoral season these are the two most
important issue
