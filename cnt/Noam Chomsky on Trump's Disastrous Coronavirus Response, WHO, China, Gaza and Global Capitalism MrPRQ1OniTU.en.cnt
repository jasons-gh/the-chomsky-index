this is democracy now democracynow.org
the quarantine report i'm amy goodman
we're broadcasting from new york the
epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic
the united states itself is the
worldwide epicenter
with about a third of the world's
reported infections and a quarter of the
global death toll
even though the u.s makes up less than
five percent of the world's population
this comes as the u.s labor department
says roughly
40 million americans have filed for
unemployment benefits since mid-march
and the scale of u.s job losses is set
to rival the great depression
well for more on the political
implications of this
unprecedented moment we're spending the
hour
with noam chomsky the world-renowned
political dissident
linguist and author laureate professor
in the department of linguistics at the
university of arizona tucson
professor emeritus at the massachusetts
institute of technology where he taught
for more than half
a century his recent books include
global discontents conversations on the
rising threats to democracy
who rules the world and requiem for the
american dream
the ten principles of concentration of
wealth and power
noam chomsky joined us for a
conversation in april from his home in
tucson arizona
where he's sheltering in place with his
wife valeria
we spoke on the day that senator bernie
sanders announced he was suspending his
presidential campaign making former vice
president joe biden the presumptive
nominee
to face donald trump in the november
election i began
by asking professor chomsky about what's
happening right now in the context of
the 2020 elections what he sees
happening in november
if trump is reelected
it's a indescribable
disaster it means that the
policies of the past four years which
have been extremely
destructive to the american population
to the world will be continued
and probably accelerated uh
the what this is going to mean for
health is bad enough i just
mentioned the lancet figures it'll get
worse
what this means for the environment
or the threat of nuclear war which no
one is talking about
but is extremely serious is
indescribable i suppose uh biden is
elected
am i i would anticipate it would be
essentially a
continuation of obama nothing
very great but at least not
totally destructive and opportunities
for an organized public
to change what is being done to impose
pressures it's common to say now that
the
sanders campaign failed i think that's a
mistake
i think it was an extraordinary success
completely shifted the
arena of debate and discussion
uh issues that were unthinkable
a couple of years ago are now right in
the middle of attention
uh the the worst crime he committed in
the eyes of the establishment
is not the policies he's proposing it's
the fact that
he was able to uh inspire
popular movements which had already been
developing
occupy black lives matter or many others
and turn them into an activist movement
which
doesn't just show up every couple of
years to push a lever and then go home
but
applies constant pressure constant
activism
and so on that could affect a biden
administration it could also even if
it's just a holding action
it means there's time to deal with the
major crises
it's very take medicare for all
or other the other major plank and
standards program free college education
across the whole
mainstream spectrum all the way to
what's
called the left and the mainstream this
is
condemned as too radical for americans
just think what that means
that's an attack on american culture and
society
which you would expect from some hostile
enemy what it's saying is it's too
radical to say that we should rise
to the level of comparable countries
they all have some form of national
health care
most of them have pre-higher education
the best performing countries nationally
like
finland free uh germany
free right to our south
mexico a poor country high quality
higher education
free so to say we should rise to the
level
of the rest of the world is considered
too radical for americans
it's an astonishing comment as i say
it's a critique of america that's
you'd expect from some super hostile
enemy
that's the left of the spectrum
tells you that we have really deep
problems
so not just trump deep he's made it much
worse
but the problems go much deeper just
like
say the ventilator catastrophe which i
described
just based on good capitalist
logic uh with the extra
hammer blow of uh making the government
ineffectual to deal with things this is
much deeper than trump
and we have to face those facts
some do i'm sure you reported i don't
remember you probably reported the
setting of the doomsday clock in january
okay yes notice what happened all
through trump's
term the minute hand of the doomsday
clock
the best general assessment we have of
the state of the world
uh moved closer to midnight termination
reached the highest point ever this
january
it exceeded it the analysts gave up
minutes moved to seconds a hundred
seconds to midnight thanks to donald
trump uh
and the republican party which is just
monstrous
no longer qualifies as a political party
it simply sheepishly uh echoes
everything the master says
zero integrity just amazing to watch
uh he surrounded himself by a collection
of psychophants who just
repeat worship lee everything he says
real
major attack on democracy is alongside
the
attack on survival the survival of
humanity to
quote jp morgan chase again the
nuclear war raising the threat of
nuclear
war dismantling the
arms control system which is to some
extent
protected us from total disaster
it's astonishing to watch the same memo
that i quoted about how
the policies were following are leading
or risking
the survival of humanity ended
by arguing that the
bank should cut back its fossil fuel
support
in part because of its the reputational
consequences their reputation is being
harmed
what does that mean that means that
activists are putting pressure on them
and they have to maintain some kind of
reputation
now that's very that's a good lesson uh
and it works we've seen some very
striking examples
take say the grand new deal a couple of
years ago
that was an objective ridicule if it was
mentioned at all
some form of green new deal is essential
for the survival of humanity now it's
part of the general agenda why
uh activist engagement
especially sunrise movement group of
young people
acted significantly up to the point of
sitting in in congressional offices they
received support
from alexandria ocasio-cortez and
other young legislators who
came into office as part of the
sanders inspired popular wave
another great success ed markey senator
from massachusetts joined in now it's a
part of the legislative agenda the next
step is to
force it through in some viable form
and there are very good ideas as to how
to do that well that's the way things
can change
with a biden presidency there would be a
if not a strongly sympathetic
administration at least
one that's can be reached can be
pressured
and that's very important you look over
the
very good labor historian i'm sure you
know eric loomis
who's uh studied uh
the uh efforts by
working people to encourage to institute
changes in the society ate
sometimes for themselves sometimes with
society generally
and he's pointed out i made an
interesting point these efforts
succeeded
when there was a tolerant or sympathetic
administration
not when there wasn't that's a big
one of many enormous differences
between trump the sociopath
and biden who's kind of a
pretty empty he can push him one way or
another
this is the most crucial election
in human history literally another four
years of trump and we're in
deep trouble if you can talk about the
enormity of this moment
and the fact that the united states has
become
the epicenter of the pandemic in the
world
can you hold forth on this what does
this mean
the wealthiest country in the world
well the united states is
i mean countries have reacted to this in
many ways
some very successfully some more or less
successfully
one is at the bottom of the barrel
that's us
the united states is the only
major country that cannot even provide
data to the world health organization
because it's so dysfunctional there's a
background
now part of the background is the
scandalous health care system
which simply is not ready for anything
that
out of the normal simply doesn't work
uh the uh and this is exacerbated by the
strange collection of
gangsters in washington who have
it's almost as if they systematically
took every possible step
to make it as bad as possible
through trump's terms last four years
has been systematically cutting back
on all of the health related
aspects of the government pentagon goes
out
a building as a wall goes up but
anything
actually anything that might benefit the
general population goes down
particularly health some of it is
almost surreal so in october for example
just with very exquisite timing
he cancelled completely a
usaid project predicted it's called
that was working in third world
countries also in china
to try to detect uh new viruses
that might turn into the anticipated
pandemic and in fact it was anticipated
since
at least since the sars epidemic in 2003
so we have a kind of combination of
factors
some of them specific to the united
states
if we want to ensure or at least
hope to avoid new pandemics which are
very likely to come
more serious than this one in part
because of the
enormous rising threat of global warming
uh the we have to look at the
sources of this one and it's
very important to think them through so
just
roughly to go back pandemics have been
predicted predicted by scientists uh
for years uh sars epidemic was
quite serious uh it was contained but
vaccines were there was a beginning of
development of vaccines they never
proceeded to the testing phase it was
clear at that time that
something more was going to happen and
several
epidemics did but it's not enough to
know that
somebody has to pick up the ball and run
with it who can do it
well the drug companies are the obvious
place
but they have no interest in it they
follow
good capitalist logic you look at market
signals
and there's no profit to be made in uh
preparing for a predicted and
anticipated catastrophe
so they weren't interested uh at that
point
uh another possibility is the government
could step in
um old enough to remember the terror of
polio was ended by a government
initiated funded project that
finally led to the salk vaccine which
was
free not no no intellectual property
rights
jonas salk said it should be as free as
the sun
okay that ended the polio terror of
measles terror
and others but the government couldn't
step in
because there's another particular
aspect of the modern europe
the neoliberal plague you remember
ronald reagan's uh sunny smile
and his little maxim about how
government is the
problem not the solution so the
government can't enter
there were some efforts nevertheless to
try to prepare for this right now
in new york and other places
the doctors and nurses are forced to
make
agonizing decisions about who to kill
not a nice decision to make because they
simply don't have
equipment and the main lack is
ventilators huge shortage of ventilators
well the obama administration
did make an effort to try to prepare for
this
and this kind of dramatically reveals
the
kind of factors that are leading to
catastrophe
they contracted with a small company
that was producing
high quality low-cost
ventilators the company was bought up by
a larger one
covidien which makes uh fancy expensive
ventilators and they shelved the project
presumably they didn't want competition
with their own
costly ones now shortly after that they
turned to the government and said they
wanted the contract
ended the reason was
they was not profitable enough so
therefore
no ventilators this is a
we have the same thing in hospitals
hospitals are under the neoliberal
programs are supposed to be
efficient meaning no spare capacity
just enough beds to get by and in fact
plenty of people me included can testify
that even the best hospitals
caused great pain and suffering to
patients even before this broke out
because of this just on time efficiency
concept that was guiding or privatized
the for-profit health care system
when anything hits out of the normal
it's just tough luck and this runs
across the system
so we have a combination of capitalist
logic which is lethal
but could be controlled but it can't be
controlled
under the neoliberal programs
which also say the government can't step
in to
to take pick up the ball when the
private sector doesn't
on top of that this becomes specific to
the united states
we have a freak show in washington a
totally
dysfunctional government which is
causing
enormous problems and it's not that
nothing was known
[Music]
a pandemic was anticipated all through
trump's term
even before his reaction was to cut
back preparation for it
astonishingly this continued
even after the pandemic hit so on
february 10th when it was already
serious
uh trump released his budget for
the coming year take a look at it
uh the budget continues the defunding
of the center for disease control and
other
government institutions
responsible for health continues to
defund them
it increases funding for some things
like fossil fuel
uh production because new subsidies to
the fossil fuel industries i mean it's
as if
the country is simply maybe not as if
the country is simply run by sociopaths
and the result so we cut back on the
efforts to deal with the
uh pandemic that's taking shape
and we increase the efforts to destroy
the environment in which
the efforts in which the united states
under trump is in the lead
in racing to the abyss and
bear in mind that that's i don't have to
tell you is a far
more serious threat than the coronavirus
this is bad serious particularly in the
united states
but we'll recover
somehow at severe cost
we're not going to recover from the
melting of the polar ice sheets
which is leading to a feedback effect
well known that increases as they melt
there's less reflective service surface
more
absorption and the dark seas
the warming that's melting them
increases
and that's just one of the factors
that's
leading to destruction unless we do
something about it
and it's not a secret uh just recently
for example a couple weeks ago
there's a very interesting leak a memo
from jp morgan chase america's biggest
bank
which warned that in their words
the survival of humanity is at risk
if we continue on our present course
which included
uh the uh funding of fossil fuel
industries by the bank itself
said we're endangering the survival
of humanity everyone who's
got eyes open and the trump
administration is very well aware of
this
uh it's difficult to find words for this
i should say other countries every act
first of all it was not a secret
i mean it's become convenient now trump
is
desperately seeking some scapegoat that
he can
blame for his astonishing failures and
incompetence
the most recent one is the world health
organization
china bashing somebody else is
responsible
but it's simply on facts are very clear
china very quickly
informed the world health organization
last december
that they were finding patients with
pneumonia like symptoms with unknown
ideology didn't know what it was about a
week later
january 7th they made public
the fact to the world health
organization the general
scientific community in the world that
chinese scientists had
found out what the source was the
coronavirus
resembling the sars virus
they had identified that
they'd sequenced the genome they were
providing the information to the world
uh the u.s intelligence was well aware
of it
they were spent january and february
they're trying to
get somebody in the white house to pay
attention to the fact
that there's a major pandemic and just
yes no nobody could listen
trump was off playing golf
or maybe listening uh checking his tv
ratings
yesterday we learned that one very high
level
official very close to the
administration
peter navarro in late january had
sent a very strong message to the white
house
saying this is a real danger but even he
couldn't break through
gnome you mentioned peter navarro the
trade representative
sending a memo it just came out in the
new york times
um in late january warning of the
uh coronavirus saying that i think
something like up to a million people
could die
and trump took from that uh setting a
travel ban
on china but not doing
a corollary which was ensuring that
the united states had the proper tests
and
also had the ppe the protective
personal equipment that doctors that
nurses
that the custodial staff and hospitals
needed to stay alive to treat patients
to help
them stay alive and the intelligence
agencies that came out
at this time even before navarro they
were all warning
trump if you could go back to even two
years ago
when he disbanded his pandemic unit
within
the national security council said that
when he's at the table in china talking
about spending money on bombs or a wall
they're not saying sir you also have to
look at what's happening here
and that unit pandemic unit not only is
about
how we deal in the united states but
also ensuring as the cdc
does and other agencies of the us
government that scientists are sent
out to other countries like china to
investigate and to help other countries
because when it comes to a pandemic
we're all in this together
so if you could talk about these early
warnings and why
testing and this personal protective
personal equipment
is so important
well remember that it continued
even after the pandemic was already
enforced
the budget proposal is astonishing
this is february 10th well into the
pandemic
trump cuts further the
health-related uh components of the
government
continuing the uh hit the
run of the acts just as they were
throughout his
uh term actually his uh the eclipse that
you played before
are part of a very clever
strategy whether this is consciously
planned or just
intuitive i don't know but
the the pattern of
simply making one statement today
contradicting it tomorrow coming out
with something else the next day
is really brilliant it means he's going
to be vindicated
whatever happens uh he'll have said it
you shoot arrows at random
some of them are going to hit the target
and his
technique uh with the fox
echo chamber and uh you know the
worshipful uh
the base is simply tuned to fox
limbaugh etc they're just gonna
pick whatever happened to be right and
said look our wonderful
president the greatest president we've
ever had our savior
knew it all along and here was the
statement
can't miss is very much like the uh
technique of producing constant lies
uh he you know i don't even have to go
through it
uh the assiduous fact checkers
uh taught them up i think it's maybe
20 000 by now or something and he's
laughing all the way
this is perfect you tell constant lies
what happens is the concept of truth
just disappeared
so noan chomsky world renowned political
dissident
uh uh well-known linguist author
activist as you listen to the fox news
this is not just a
channel these are the people that
president trump channels these are
perhaps his senior
advisors as they continually played this
down
do you hold president trump responsible
would you say he has blood on his
hands there's no question
uh trump makes some crazy statement
then amplified by the fox news
echo chamber the next day
he says the opposite that's exit
that's the echo chamber amplifies that
notice that the tone the tone of the
reporting is interesting
it's all with perfect confidence
not uh what any sane
rational person would say we really
don't know there's a lot of uncertainty
this is the way things look
uh today there's nothing like that
absolute confidence no matter what it
what
the dear leader says we amplify it
and it's a interesting dialogue
they amplify what he says sean hannity
can say
this is the greatest move that was ever
made in the history of the world
the next morning uh trump tunes into
fox and friends that listens to whatever
said
that becomes his thought for the day
it's an interaction murdoch
and trump uh moving
literally to try to destroy the country
and destroy the world because in the
background we should not
never forget is a far greater threat
that is coming closer and closer
while trump is leading the way
to destruction he has some assistance
so down on the southern part of the
hemisphere
there's another madman jair bolsonaro is
trying to vie with trump to see
who can be the worst criminal in on the
planet
uh he's telling the brazilians
it's nothing it's just a cold brazilians
don't get viruses
we're immune to them
his health minister and other officials
are
trying to butt in and say look this is
really serious
the governors many of them fortunately
are ignoring what he says
but brazil is facing a terrible crisis
it's actually gotten to the point where
in the
favelas you know these miserable slums
in
rio the where the government does
nothing for the people
uh others have intervened to try to
impose sensible
restrictions insofar as it's possible
under those miserable
conditions who the crime gangs
the crime gangs that torture the
population
have moved in to try to impose health
standards
the indigenous population is
facing a virtual genocide which won't
bother
bolsonaro he doesn't think they should
be there anyway
meanwhile while all this is going on
scientific papers are coming out a
warning
that in 15 years
the amazon is going to shift
from being a net carbon
sink to a net co2
emitter that's devastating for brazil
in fact for the whole world so we have
the colossus of the north as it's called
in the hands of
sociopaths who are doing whatever they
can
to harm the country and the world and
the
colossus of the south as it's been
called
is in its own way doing the same thing
i can i'm able to follow this pretty
closely because my wife valeria's
brazilian and keeps me up to date with
the
news that's coming out in brazil and
it's simply
shocking to see meanwhile other
countries are reacting sensibly
so as soon as the news started coming
out from china and there was
plenty of news right away contrary to
what is being claimed
uh the countries on the chinese
periphery
that began to react taiwan
south korea singapore
quite effectively some of them have it
basically under control
and new zealand has apparently quashed
the crisis the coronavirus maybe almost
completely
uh with a lockdown right away an
immediate lockdown
for a couple of weeks and sometimes
we've come close to ending it
you're looking to europe the uh
most of europe just dithered but some
countries the better organized countries
did
act right away it's very striking
it would be very useful for americans
to compare trump's ravings
of the kind you illustrated with angela
merkel's
uh trans german chancellor her sober
factual uh accountant speak talk
to the german people describing exactly
what's happening
and what has to be done noam we only
have a minute but i wanted to ask you
as we speak to you at your home in
tucson arizona
where you are sheltering at home
where you are staying at home because we
are in the midst of this pandemic to
prevent
community spread and to protect yourself
and your family
um what gives you hope
i should say that i'm following a strict
regimen because my wife valeria is
taking charge and i follow her orders so
valeria and i
are in a isolation
but what gives me hope is the actions
that possible popular groups are taking
all over the world
many of them some of them are there are
some things happening that are
truly inspiring now takes the
doctors and the nurses who are working
overtime under extremely dangerous
conditions
lacking especially in the united states
lacking even
minimal of support being compelled
to make these agonizing decisions about
who to kill tomorrow
but they're doing it it's just a
it's an inspiring tribute to the
resources of the human spirit a model
of what can be done along with the
popular actions the moves to create a
progressive international
these are all very positive signs
if you look back in recent history there
have been times where things looked
really hopeless and desperate
i can go back to my early childhood
late 30s early 40s it looked as though
the rise of the the nazi
plague was inexorable victory after
victory
it looked like he couldn't stop it it's
the most
horrible development in human history
well turns out i didn't know that at the
time
that u.s planners were expecting that
the post-war world
would be divided between a u.s
controlled world
and a german-controlled world including
all of eurasia a horrifying idea
well was overcome
there have been other series the
civil rights movement young
freedom writers going out into the
alabama to try to encourage black
farmers to
go to vote despite the threat serious
threat of
being murdered and being murdered
themselves
these were this is examples of
what humans can do and have done
and we see many signs of it today and
that's the basis for hope
if you can talk for a moment globally
about what's happening on an issue that
you
that has been close to your heart for
decades and that is the occupied
territories
gaza and the west bank um
what it means for a place like gaza
called by the u.n and people around the
world
a kind of open-air prison of almost 2
million
people what the pandemic could mean
there it's
almost impossible to think about gaza is
two million people who are in the
living in a prison open-air prison
under constant attack uh
israel which is the occupying power
recognized by everyone in the world
except israel uh israel is imposing
has been imposing very harsh sanctions
ever since the palestinians made the
mistake of
carrying out the first free election in
the
arab world and electing the wrong people
united states and israel came down on
them like a ton of bricks
israel's policy is was explained
by a dough vice gloss that person in
charge of
the withdrawal of israeli troops with
all the settlers and
imposition of the new regime explained
frankly
we are putting the people of gaza on a
diet
just enough to keep them alive meaning
wouldn't look good if they all die but
not
anything more than that so not a piece
of
chocolate or a toy for a child that's
out
just enough to stay alive and if you
want if you
have a serious health problem and maybe
you can apply
to go to the hospital in in
east jerusalem maybe after a couple of
weeks you'll be allowed to go
maybe a child is allowed to go but his
mother's not allowed to come
uh if the pen when there are now a
couple of cases in
gaza if that extends
it's a total disaster uh international
institutions have
pointed out that by 2020 that's now
gaza will probably become barely livable
about 95 of the waters totally polluted
places of disaster that's and trump has
made sure
that it'll get worse he withdrew
funding from the support systems
for palestinians in gaza and the west
bank
killed the funding palestinian hospitals
killed the funding and he had a reason
they weren't praising him enough they
weren't respectful
of the god so therefore we'll strangle
them
even when they're barely surviving under
a
harsh and brutal regime incidentally
this
extends to the palestinians in israel as
well
human rights activists in israel pointed
out
recently there's articles about it that
israel finally began to
set up a few drive-by
testing areas
only in jewish areas
not in the areas of with palestinian
population
and to make sure that uh that
the intended results would follow they
uh announced it only in hebrew
not in arabic so palestinians wouldn't
even know
well that's within israel in the
occupied territories
far worse and the trump hammer
came in uh saying we're not even going
to give you
a penny because you're not respectful
enough of me
i don't know how to describe this kind
of thing i can't find words for it
noam chomsky what do you think is
required in an international response to
stop the rise of authoritarianism
in response to this pandemic for example
in the philippines where the
authoritarian leader trump ally duterte
talks about
killing people the massive
crackdown uh without support of the
people of india 1.3 billion people with
narendra modi
president trump was in india as the
pandemic was taking off never saying a
word about it packing a stadium a
hundred thousand people
um you have orben uh orban
and hungary uh who is now ruling by
decree um what would
what would it take to turn that around
to be a progressive response
well actually what's happening to the
extent that you can find some
coherent policy in the madness in the
white house
one thing does emerge with considerable
clarity namely an effort to construct
an international of the most reactionary
states
and oppressive states led by the
gangster in the white house
now this is taking shape can run through
it but since you mentioned
india modi who is
a hindu nationalist extremist
is can systematically
moving that to destroy indian
secular democracy and to
crush the muslim population what's
happening in
kashmir is horrifying was bad enough
before now getting much worse
same with the muslim population a huge
population in india
the current lockdown
is almost
you can almost describe it as genocidal
modi gave i think a four-hour warning
saying total lockdown that's
over a billion people some of them have
nowhere to go uh people in the informal
economy which is a huge number of people
are just cast out go walk back to your
village
which may be a thousand miles away and
die on the roadside
this is a huge catastrophe in the making
uh right on top of the strong
efforts to impose the you know the
ultra right uh hindu
doctrines that are at the core of modi's
thinking and background what's happening
quite apart from this uh india in fact
south asia generally is going to become
unlivable pretty soon if current
climate policies persist last
summer the temperature in rajasthan went
up to
50 degrees centigrade and it's
increasing
hundreds of millions of people in india
that don't have access to water
it's going to get much worse could lead
to a
nuclear war between the two powers that
basically rely on the same water
resources which are declining under
global warming
pakistan and india i mean the
horror story that's developing is
again indescribable you can't find words
for it
and some people are cheering about it
like donald trump and his
friend bolsonaro in brazil a couple of
other
sociopaths but how do you counter a
reactionary international
by developing a progressive
international and there are steps to
that
they don't get much publicity but uh
this i think it's this coming december
there will be a
formal announcement of what has been in
process for some time
uh uh janesville varafakas
the founder and leading figure in
the m25 the progressive
movement in europe very important
navarro focus and bernie sanders
that came out with a declaration calling
for a
progressive international to
combat and we hope overcome
the reactionary international based in
the white house
now if you look at the level of states
this looks like of
extremely unequal competition
but states are not the only things that
exist
if you look at the level of people it's
not impossible
it's possible to construct a progressive
international
based on people ranging
from the organized political groups that
have
been proliferating that have gotten a
huge shot in the arm from the sanders
campaign
uh ranging from them to self-help
mutually
self-help organizations that are arising
in communities all over the world
in the most impoverished areas of brazil
for example
and even this astonishing fact that i
mentioned
that the murderous crime gangs are
taking responsibility for
bringing some form of
decent protection against the
pandemic and the favelas the miserable
slums in
rio all of this is happening on the
popular level
if it expands and develops if people
don't just
give up and despair but work to
change the world as they've done in the
past under much worse conditions
if they do that there's a chance for a
progressive international
and notice bear in mind that there are
also
striking cases of internationalism
progressive internationalism at the
state level
so take a look at the european union
the rich countries in europe
like germany have recently given us a
lesson
in just what the union means
right germany's managing pretty well
they probably have the lowest death rate
in the world it's an organized society
right next door northern italy is
suffering
miserably is germany giving them any aid
no in fact germany even blocked
the effort to develop euro bonds
general uh bonds in europe which could
be used to alleviate
the suffering and the countries under
worst
the worst conditions but fortunately for
italy
it can look across the atlantic for aid
from the superpower on the western
hemisphere
cuba cuba is
once again as before exhibiting
extraordinary internationalism sending
doctors
to italy germany won't do it but cuba
can
uh china is providing materially
so these are steps towards progressive
internationalism
