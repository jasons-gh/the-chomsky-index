gnorm Tomsk is here he is a political
activist he's a writer and his professor
at MIT he is written exclusively and
lectured around the world on linguistics
philosophy and politics he is widely
credited with having revolutionized
modern linguistics he is the author of
numerous books including American power
in the new mandarins and also 9/11 here
is hegemony our survival his newest book
I am pleased to have him on this program
for many reasons including the fact that
I get more emails about please have mr.
Chomsky on this program than anyone can
ever imagine how do you explain this
phenomenal connection between you and
certainly an audience of people who are
user-friendly with the internet it well
I think people who are there's an
enormous number of people who are
involved in a informal disorganized
activists dissident culture and they
tend to make their own connections
outside the major institutional channels
which are not not hospitable to them and
the internet has been has become a major
form of interconnection organizing not
just in the United States everywhere I
mean in South Korea for example they
recently elected a president using the
internet for organizing and
communication and getting around the
strong opposition of the media and the
concentrated power to the popular
candidates we happen to be very wired up
society abroad and I think as a higher
penetration in South Korea perhaps more
than any other country except Singapore
it's happening every one that takes a
Indonesia when the support the
dictatorship was overthrown in 1998 a
lot of the organizing but a lot of it
was student activism and they it was a
very harsh brutal society but they did
succeed through internet
interconnections to organize political
actions demonstrations other activities
and it was a major factor leaving the
leading to the overthrow
the dictatorship well Howard Dean I
suspect would say that one of the
primary reasons he's been able to get to
this commanding position in the
Democratic race for the presidency is
the internet lobbying both to
communicate and to raise money yeah it's
um it's a sort of a can also be a lethal
instrument but lethal in what way well
I'm sure you get I don't want to guess
how many emails that one of the problems
with the internet I mean it's the good
part of it is it's free and open right
exactly of course that has a downside
that means that things go up that have
no review and their you know support any
caucuses they clog the system and so
it's a mixture but it's it certainly has
been an extremely effective way of
allowing people to participate actively
in in even in everything from industrial
societies very repressive society so
take say the world Social Forum which is
a huge enterprise hundred hundred
thousand people last year it's mostly
internet organized there's just no other
meanings of inter communication among
highly diverse people most of them Oh
somewhat you know out of the power
centers in their own societies and this
provides them the means of organizing
exchanging information interaction that
gives an access to a far wider range of
sources of information and analysis than
they would get by you know picking up
the newspapers at the newsstand and
major if they do you think regimes
around there were a lot to be frightened
of the possibilities of the internet I'm
sure they are including your own
government since the the internet was
like most modern technology it came out
of the state system right they have a
very a lot of the economy relies on a
dynamic state sector the internet was
developed in the Pentagon or somewhere
well it was places like MIT it came yes
it came out of Pentagon funding and that
the Advanced Research Project agency the
Pentagon about their early 60s
and remained inside the state system
until the mid 90s I think 1995 it was
privatized and since then it's changed I
mean that before that it was considered
would affect was called usually an
information Highway after that it's
mostly called the e-commerce right and
the character of it changed but there
has been a lot of concern in power
centers all over the world that it's
just too free and open and the question
is how can you shape it and modify it so
as to lead people in preferred
directions no away from say organizing
the forum yeah exactly
what for example the Chinese doing about
it do you know in China I think internet
access is quite restricted is what I
thought and highly censored I don't know
how much even limited access there is
but it's a very hard medium to control
exactly no one people have access they
can do all sorts of things so the the
means of controlling it I that are being
considered as far as I understand are
mostly trying to lean people in
particular directions so when you enter
an internet portal you know you'll be
sort of drawn off disability here about
that ring opening up it'll take you
somewhere and the idea is you'll have to
use you know energy and initiative and
commitment and know what you're looking
for or if you want to go and the in the
directions less preferred by powers
nedar's which is it's a terrain of
struggle right now there's a lot of
pressure from popular and activist
groups to make it leave it entirely open
not control if you were this would be
your last day on earth not that far from
well you're 475 yeah yeah would would
your would you like what said about you
to be your political arguments or your
contribution to the theory of
linguistics
be honest truth I really don't care you
know I mean I'd like to see people
follow up on the things that are
interesting and important and productive
and forget about the things that were
byways in mistakes and so on
but if I my name is attached to it or
not what would you characterize as most
important in your judgment if you are
well I mean I played a certain role and
reshaping the fields concerned with the
human intellectual faculties cognitive
sciences in particular linguistics some
of it has been extremely productive not
me it's cooperative enterprise and
that's often running on its own right in
the political domain and you know I
would like to see people energized
participating thinking for themselves
not subordinating themselves to systems
of discipline and propaganda either in
the structure of life and there's plenty
of that or in the doctrinal domains so
if people can be can come to use the
capacities that they in fact have and
the opportunities that in fact have to
overcome systems of authority
illegitimate Authority domination
hierarchy freed themselves think through
issues for themselves not the way
they're taught to conform and do
something about it that's the best
legacy and as I said you and you said
that I know nothing about linguistics
one of many subjects I know nothing
about but especially linguistics if
there is there one question in the air
in that whole realm though that you
would like most to know the answer to
like everyone I have own personal quirks
yes there are some questions which are
big mega questions there are megatons
which are on the border of research you
can't really they're a little beyond
what you can study very much you can
take a pick away at them but
well one kind of question which is a
sort of a personal obsession is that if
you look at any by a lot of language is
a biological system as part of error
it's like our immune system or visual
systems just something humans have it's
highly specific to humans they don't
seem to be any counterparts elsewhere in
nature you're in New York because of our
mutual friend Edward syeda passed away
several month or so ago correct yeah and
you tell me what you tell me just
because you're here your sense of what
would you most want to say an
appreciation of him well it was an old
friend we're very close friends for
years we had a lot of mutual interests
we would there be culture music politics
culture politics mainly mainly political
interests including his prime concern
also a major concern of mine at least
for my much broader questions of justice
freedom oppression which he was much
involved in me too and our paths often
crossed and then it was just a close
personal friendship actually he had
arranged never talked about this much
but back in the year I guess it must
have been around 20 years ago or 25
years ago he began arranging with
meetings between high officials in the
Palestine Liberation Organization when
they were visiting New York meeting us
with friends of his who were sympathetic
to the Palestinians critical of PLO to
see if there could be some constructive
discussion to suggest ways in which they
could change what they're doing to
achieve results which would make more
sense for the people involved and I was
involved in some of those meeting
anything come out of no have to say you
know what do you think of the Geneva
Accord that they've been current Geneva
course yes exactly well it offers it's
it's a great improvement over the Camp
David proposals which were completely
unacceptable Palestine
yeah they made no sense you know Jakarta
said that today on a recent appearance
on his program
oh really well he's quite right and as
soon as you look at a map of what was
proposed you see that was absolutely
unacceptable and it broke up the others
ought to talk about percentages and so
on have didn't mean a thing if you
looked at the actual maps that were
discussed which unfortunately we're not
easily available in the United States
that should have been but they weren't
as soon as you look at the maps you see
that what it effect it did was break the
West Bank into three pretty separate ten
tons so this one I take it was
territories well they were technically
contiguous but only way around the edges
she wanted to go from Bethlem to
Ramallah you were going to go way to the
east and the so the three effectively
separated territories all again
effectively separated from a little part
of East Jerusalem which is the center of
traditional center of Palestinian
cultural educational commercial
existence and it was a kind of a bantha
Stan situation as was discussed in
Israel at the time and that and of
course it was all separated from Gaza
well you know that's actually the
meaning of that was described by the
president barak chief negotiator Shlomo
enemy yeah and he was the negotiator at
Camp David and he had he was an academic
and shortly before he entered the
government he wrote a book about it in
Hebrew in which he said the goal of the
whole Oslo process and leading to this
that would be what he called a permanent
neo-colonial dependency the Palestinians
would be a neo-colonial effectively
modern colonial dependency permanently
and in fact that's what the proposal was
and it couldn't work however after the
Camp David proposals broke down this is
September 2000 Boggess September 2000
that's when the current EDA father
started but negotiations continued
and the made some progress in January
2001 there were meetings in Taba which
led to informal meetings but with fairly
high-level people on both sides and
they've made considerable progress
towards a more acceptable to state
settlement but it was too late then
because the Israelis were into their
election
they were into the election campaign and
prime minister Barak cancelled the
meetings and after Sharon was elected
and the violence began to escalate they
were never picked up everyone soon dies
him to that they were never continued
however it turns out now we've learned
that contacts did continue and the
Geneva Accords that you mentioned are
the results of these continuing contacts
and they are they make considerable
progress beyond the Taba of course
hammered out by Yoshi Belen and other
Israelis in over two years with
potential and who I'm not sure in part
may have been part of may have been
members of the Palestinian Authority or
not I don't know they some had been but
all are close to it I mean there is
close to the center of Palestinian
Palestinian it's known that the state 11
informal authority but they were as
close to the central part of it as the
Israeli negotiators were to the Israeli
go in effect probably closer know your
friend the lady that was I didn't have
much to say good about Yasser Arafat nor
did I know - you know in fact we were
very much in accord about this for a
long time some of it a real disservice
to the Palestinians well it's I don't
think when you can say that exactly why
is that because he's also a symbol it
with without him as a statement American
so look he remained a symbol of
Palestinian nationality struggle or
refusal to submit that's important right
I mean whatever you may think of him
personally
just serving the role of enabling people
to resist harsh oppression probable
destruction which was the goal
that's significant whatever you think
about his particular decisions and
choices and of those they're a mixture
so I I wouldn't I mean I was always
harshly critical you look at what I
wrote was critical nevertheless there
are there's a strain which was on the
right track so in the mid 1970s Arafat
did recognize that the settlement would
have to be to state political settlement
there was a Security Council resolution
debated in January 1976 which was
supported by the PLO they publicly
supported it which called for a third
state settlement on the international
border with full recognition of Israel's
rights to peace and security and so on
and so forth that was a good resolution
unfortunately the u.s. vetoed that and
then there was a process for a number of
years in which our effect in his
complicated way of which there's much to
criticize nevertheless one theme that
ran through it was trying to press for
such a settlement it the reason Israel
invaded Lebanon in 1982 was to try to
prevent these negotiate these efforts at
diplomacy to continue in fact they said
publicly it was an invasion to secure
the winter the invasion of Lebanon yeah
which is where the palace Mello
restaurant is and they wanted to destroy
the that it was called and by the high
command in fact a war for the West Bank
we have to stop the negotiations which
and the diplomacy which was becoming an
embarrassment and let's get back to
terror that are happier with that and
this continued for some years and it's a
sort of a mixture of corruption terror
violence bad judgment and a continuing
drive towards what has to be what almost
the entire world recognized must be some
kind of political settlement along the
roughly along the international border
with two states along the sixty three
borders subsea said
roughly with some modifications how do
you actually I should add and we should
be willing to recognize this the main
reason this has not taken place is that
the US has blocked it for 30 years
Helena laterally how so well as I said
it vetoed the 1976 resolution vetoed
another security council resolution in
1980 the Israelis are independent of it
well you know we could argue about
exactly why but did Israel didn't like
it but they could never have luck that
if the u.s. hadn't backed it
meanwhile much more importantly the u.s.
provided means the diplomatic military
and economic support which enabled
Israel to continue slowly integrating
the territories effectively within
Israel the big settlement programs the
infrastructure programs and they can't
do it without us support and that's true
right this minute they could not they
can't do it without us support and they
know it your support in terms of in the
international community or us support at
the UN for example every level in other
words you're suggesting there without
the US the overloon looming possible
veto at the Security Council or in some
other way that there would be some kind
of one of the economics and Ameri
reaction militarily without the u.s.
they can't stand the small country can
stand alone against a unified
international community it's just
impossible there all kinds of ways of
stopping them and they need the economic
support in the military so that's a nice
segue in Iraq but I want to come back to
other things well you know and Israel
has been as has become actually goes
back before 1976 the in 1971 that's
where the real split between the United
States and the world begins on this in
1971 the president of Egypt the new
president of Egypt that President Sadat
offered Israel a full peace treaty in
return for withdrawal from Egyptian
territory said nothing about the West
Bank nothing about the Palestinians at
full peace treaty recognizing
incorporating the main UN
2:42 so the right to live in peace and
security and so on and so forth
everything nothing about the refugees
just in return for withdrawal from
Egyptian territory Israel discussed it
they knew that it was a possible we have
internal records and others actually I
see Baylin wrote his doctoral
dissertation was in Hebrew about
revealing a lot of the records and discs
a Burnet records and other discussions
about this but I was also in the public
record now they had discussed the
question should they accept it no they
had a choice and it was a fateful choice
the choice was to accept peace with
Egypt it's the main military force which
would essentially end the military
conflict there were no other major Arab
military forces so accept peace with
Egypt have a still retain control of the
occupied territories they have to do
something about it because it was
another table wasn't on the table and
integrate themselves somehow into the
region that was one choice the other
choice was to insist on expansion and
the crucial expansion at that time was
not the West Bank
it was northeastern China Egyptian
territory they wanted to expand into
northeastern Sinai and there were big
developments there driving veterans out
of their homes they were building city
in fact an old Jewish City and
northeastern Sinai that was a choice
that if they made the second choice as
they did that entailed dependency on the
United States because there was going to
be a situation of permanent conflict and
that was the choice that was made I
think was a very bad mistake but my
impression was and I'm again my
impression was that that in fact one
week we had the agreement between Egypt
1978 yeah was it the others withdrew and
there and in fact arrows Rome came in
and cleaned up the settlements well no
in in northeastern China right yeah the
but that's only half the story by 1977
what the what happened in 71 is the
offer was made Israel rejected it the
crucial question is what would the
United State
well there was an internal debate in the
United States and it was won by Henry
Kissinger whose view was as he described
that that we should keep to what he
called stalemate meaning no negotiations
just work she was opposed to an
agreement in 1971 between Egypt and
Israel yes he led to the withdrawal from
the Sinai once again now the reason that
the Sun and it be a diplomatic relation
between the two countries yes and that
decided the matter which you know the
way the u.s. goes sort of determines
what happens it's just well now when
that led to a war so that can be three
yes he kept saying look if you don't
withdraw from the Sinai there's going to
be a war nobody believed nobody took it
seriously when the work it worth did
comment 73 and it was a huge shot it was
close thing for Israel I didn't us ended
up earlier alert after at that point
Kissinger recognized that you can't but
Egypt isn't a basket case you can't just
dismiss it then he began his shuttle
diplomacy and it goes on up to Camp
David finally semi 879 and at that point
so that the US and Israel agreed to an
offer that so that had presented in 1971
but the new one was harsher from the
point of view of Israel in the United
States than the original would have been
better off they've accepted 71 rather
than the one was dividual from their
point of view Jimmy Carter can see but
in 71 there was nothing about the
Palestinians by 1977 the Palestinian
issue was on the table and the US and
Israel had to accept an order an offer
which recognized in some fashion
Palestinian national rights which they
didn't want to do I mean I think they
should have done it so I can't say it's
worse but they didn't want it now it's
interesting that this is described in
the United States as a diplomatic
triumph in fact it was a diplomatic
attached Rafi
if they'd had been accepted in 1971 with
Jimmy Carter was here several days ago
I mean he certainly thought it was the
diplomatic trying he probably doesn't
know the history I mean you should have
asked him whether he knows what happened
in the background well if I'd had this
interview before I wouldn't well it's
all on the public record yeah you know
what I mean
but but you know this is one of the many
things we have to learn about and if we
want to make to gain some understanding
of what's really happening there so when
you ask questions about say Arafat you
know unfortunately all this has to come
in okay fair enough
looks interesting now let me let me make
this point I spoke to someone about you
today and he said the following to me
someone who many his views you would
recommend you would what agree with some
not he said me that after compliment in
your mind quality of the mind and
contributions you'd made he said that
what you had done is turned American
exceptionalism on its back and that your
for all those who believed in our
conceptions you had believed in exactly
the opposite whatever that is now let me
stay with this question on the other
hand there are people who have asked you
look if you have such strong feelings
about how wrongheaded American policy
has been why don't you leave the country
of frequent sort of things thrown at
people look critical frequently and you
always say I love this country
right I mean it's a very interesting
question let's just try it in some other
country you know it's sometimes easier
to think about things clearly if we
let's go back to say our the big enemy
Soviet Union right I mean the Russians
would have been delighted to have the
dissidents leave the country if soccer
have been willing to come yes they would
have applauded it what does it make
sense to ask so why don't you leave it
the Soviet Union I mean I'm not asking
that question I'm asking that question
the framing the point that you've always
said the framework in which the country
of any question should be understood
right it's assuming that you can't have
it then you stay and fight for values
because you love the country you think
that the country ought to live up to
these values now they're cut you know
you can't rank country is
ABC the country's up all sorts of
properties there's a culture there's a
society there's modes of interaction and
so on a lot of the things that are
simply achievements now it takes a
protection of free speech right it's
unique in the United States there are a
lot of great things that have been
achieved there are a lot of rotten
things that have been done if you if you
have any concern about the country
meaning its people its culture and so on
you want to save and extend and amplify
the achievements and modify the immanuel
free speech high up on that list of area
that's not the only one okay but tell me
more and then we'll come to some of the
criticisms because that you have made
about American imperialism and the like
see that's so we have to make a
distinction between state power and a
country the different things I
understand the different but it's often
not distinguished if you criticize state
policy you're not criticizing it I
understand that too I mean we first
unfrequently when you're traveling
around the world as I do you know people
say I love you know I'm just happy with
policy I hate the policy and if it's
we're responsible for the policy it's a
free country we can't say you know I
don't have any responsibility for the
policy because we do we may not know
about it but then we should find out
about it and if we decide we don't like
it we should change it in fact take a
look at the question we've just been
discussing to state settlement about
two-thirds of the American population
supports the international consensus on
this and long which is they ought to be
a two-state solution not roughly the
size d7 borders and it's kind of gently
look the polls
I mean polls will you find roughly
two-thirds of the population saying yes
I support that and roughly the same
proportion says the US ought to become
more involved in the diplomacy people
don't know that that's contradiction the
reason that that policy has that program
has not been achieved is because of
consistent US intervention to prevent it
from being achieved and that continues
at this very moment in fact okay it is a
free country we've got a lot of freedom
that means we had people have the
opportunity to discover it's work you
know it's not going to come easily
that's where the internet is well they
have the opportunity to discover the
relevant facts in background which
should show them that their position is
contradictory they must come to
understand what the US government role
has been over the years in preventing
the outcome that they want okay do you
believe do you in the end and if in fact
accept the premise that people get for
the most part in a democracy people get
the government they deserve no no you
don't know and you because you're the
law well let me finish because you
believe the political process is corrupt
and it's not it's it's what look see
what everybody says look to me I know
it's saying it's not it's not that
simple right I mean it it's not that
there's robbery and stealing of
elections there is a distribution of
power internal to the country enormous
disparity of economic and other power
and that influences everything that
happens in dramatic ways so many issues
simply don't come up in election to
perhaps have more power than they have
not sin therefore well material decide
if you really look closely elections
they restrict themselves to issues on
which the population they eliminate
issues where the mass of the population
opposes a lead opinion systematically
and the population is aware I'll say
that again I'm sorry well let's take a
concrete okay the year 2000 election
saying among the issues that were
highest in concern to the general
population are things that roughly
relate to the so-called trade agreements
so deficits overseas investment that
transfer of jobs you know lots of topics
like that did the right at that time
there was a plan for a an International
Hemisphere conference Quebec hemispheric
summit three months later which was
intended to extend the NAFTA type
agreement to the whole hemisphere now
that's it these are issues of enormous
concern
did it come up in the election no now
there's a reason why it didn't come up
in the election that's consistent on
those
the public tends to oppose policies on
which there is an elite consensus and
therefore it doesn't come up in
elections well that's the reflection I
mean let me just make sure I'm saying
well how do you stand yourself on the
map to agreement I agree with the
general population I think with your
Lobby whose view is critical critical
for the cause because it's the wrong
agreement if you go back to 1990 10
years ago and the NAFTA agreement was
coming along there were serious critical
analyses of it which were in favor of a
North American Free Trade Agreement but
not this one
the analyses came from the labor
movement they came from Congress's
Research Bureau the office of Technology
Assessment pretty much the same analyses
said yeah a North agreement the North
American economic green be a good idea
but this one is designed and as
effectively an investor rights agreement
it privileges rights of investors and
lenders and it marginalizes the rights
of people and where you've already done
them were you worried about the loss of
jobs and those kinds of issues that
became a political football on unions
essentially were opposed to us that's
the story that's not true no words
you're saying that then they they
mislead us when they made that argument
no that unions did not make they never
made an argument that we're opposed
because the jobs they mentioned that but
the labor movement had an official
position it was produced by the labor
Advisory Council a long detailed
analysis and it was a very sensible
position it was never given it never
entered the media discussion it was
never given any publicity the labor
market the labor movement was accused of
crude nationalism this that the other
thing that was not their position their
actual position never made it to the
public agenda and and the same is true
of Congress's own Research Bureau which
had a rather similar analysis yes in
favor of NAFTA style agreement but not
that one it's kind of interesting that a
few days ago the Carnegie Endowment
released an analysis of NAFTA saying
fairly critical analysis it was reported
in the press making some proposals
how it should have been done and those
proposals though they didn't say so
happen to be very similar to those that
were proposed by the labor movement and
Congress has researched we were 10 years
ago but didn't enter the political
discussion was not mentioned in the
media for example well this is only one
example of which there are numerous ones
anyway by saying that what you're
arguing that people are not getting the
information they need to make wise
choices they aren't you nor in fact are
they given the choice they aren't given
the choice the choice between the two
parties now made in an election know
that they have but the two parties
represent essentially the same
concentration of interests of economic
power the United States is essentially a
one-party state it's has two factions of
the business party in fact one of the
leading one of the leading political
science analyses of the nature of the
u.s. party system by fine political
sciences that you know receive
Massachusetts Tom Ferguson is what he
calls the investment theory of politics
investors get together to invest the
control well let me ask you this let's
take two or three countries with you and
I know okay we have two parties in the
United Kingdom right mm-hmm the toy part
of the Labor Party would you say the
same thing about them essentially it
depends when today it's today it's close
to in France they're France you have you
have a Socialist Party and a you know
the Chirac garlis party essentially the
same I mean they didn't no not up not a
whole lot of differences there may 35
explain in Spain we have Socialist Party
well I'd say I would suggest we take is
any different in any of those countries
in terms of how much difference there
are because let me let me make this
argue with you and just get to
essentially in most countries the battle
in politics is for the center is it not
in most places you know it doesn't mean
that that's simply not true there are
countries that have a much more lively
Democratic culture so let's take a
country that has a really lively
Democratic culture much more than we do
like Brazil okay
Brazil is a rich potentially rich
important country in Brazil
something just happened reasonably which
should humiliate us big it's a real
lesson in democracy in Brazil popular
movements Matt large-scale popular
movements which has been developing over
20 years reached the scale where they
were able to elect a populist president
over the opposition of
highly-concentrated
capital and media concentration we can't
even dream about that well that's a
functioning democratic culture let me
let me stop you for a second let me just
get a couple of questions in number one
I ask that question recently of Garry
wills was here you know why haven't we
seen in the United States more success
by a powerful coalition essentially
coming from the left but but not
necessarily defined by what the
conception traditional condition was it
might be of the left of Labor Inari's we
have black and white Francine what was
it the last time number of times we saw
it with certain sixties that's where the
Great Society programs come from we
thought in the 30s that's where the New
Deal comes from and in fact this is a
battle that goes back to the origins of
American history you know the the
original constitutional framework the
wave matters author the Great Society
programs was Lyndon Johnson that's right
and he read the programs are not
initiated by leaders that's a serious
misunderstanding those programs were
initiated primarily about people who
actually are many of them who'd served
with FDR see that's a serious
misinterpretation I believe of the way
the political system works leaders may
sign their names and they may push
programs but they do it because a
popular constituency is compelling them
to do it that's the way changes take
place I mean if there's a large-scale
popular movement and their pressures
there'll be somebody will say I'm your
leader but you know since you've made
what happened in this the programs that
came out of the so-called Great Society
were the result of popular ferment and
activism and changes that were taking
place significant changes that were
taking place in the 1960s which very
much democratize the society
and it led to these programs since then
there's been an enormous counter-attack
from business sectors trying to beat it
back and that's the course of history
you know it's the same with the civil
rights movement or the same with the but
let me let me make this point balance
gets a lot of other things and I want to
say that we were 42 minutes in we're
doing an hour with you and I want to
invite you back because inevitably
people are going to say to me you know
you could have gone for two or three
hours in minimum you know or they will
say you interrupted too much or they say
a lot of other things and and I do want
to hear from you and I you know many
people many people so Lyndon Johnson you
know as a man who had was too beholden
to economic interest in terms of how
achieved his own wealth and in terms of
a whole range of things whether it was
brown rude in Texas whether his
relationship with a whole lot of
institution or you were saying that he
responded the way he did to Great
Society programs having to do with with
medical care having to do with poverty
having to a whole range of issues
responded and civil rights because the
public pressure was the same was true of
John F Kennedy I'm willing to argue with
you that Lyndon Johnson responded in
part because that was where his heart
was and his sense of legatee in terms of
what it enclosed him and secondly he'd
some of the things that John Kennedy
responded to he saw his opportunity in
history in a sense to show that he could
get these things enacted because that
was his principal skill see we're not
disagreeing we're talking about
different topics the topic that you're
talking about it's individual
personalities so the individual
personality Lyndon Johnson what was
going on in his mind the topic that I'm
talking about is how popular movements
develop create their own programs press
for them finally often get somebody to
initiate them there's a different
question and I mean I mean it does only
agree with you actually I mean I look
with great interest in what's happening
in Brazil and I know it's happened here
that's that's why why do we have freedom
of speech the freedom of speech is not
in the Constitution it's not in the Bill
of Rights in fact up until the 19th it's
not up until the 1960s in fact the legal
battles about freedom of speech are
mostly in the 20th century and there was
no real legal protection
for substantial freedom of speech
actually until the sixties in the 1960s
the Supreme Court finally first in the
course of the civil rights movement then
later in the decade finally realized a
level of legal protection of freedom of
speech that to my knowledge doesn't
exist in any other country and if a
large part of it grew out of the
activism just to understand you because
I want to go to some things that are
often attached to you and bring great
controversy to you other than freedom of
speech what else do you think it is is
part of what America you know represents
yes representative things I like that
are great about American life for one
thing we have compared to those
societies there's very little in the way
of a kind of a caste system so people
would interact independently of social
position is there autocracy there is in
certainly in terms of policy formation
that's overwhelming but we're talking in
terms of personal interaction are you
does it matter whether your this is your
what you will do or that's what you do
well these interactions among people
informal interactions are in my view
much healthier in the United States than
other societies that I know now those
are important facts about a culture high
freedom speech is not just a matter of
law it's a matter of being internalized
you know realizing understanding that's
my right and I'm gonna defend it that's
important and the same is true of other
rights actually the United States has
become a much more civilized society
since the nineteen sixties just in our
recent lifetime cause do you think
because of popular activism
let's take women's rights was that an
issue forty years ago no environmental
issues do they exist forty years ago no
let's take something like opposition to
aggression and violence but that
attitudes on that have changed
enormously I mean when John F Kennedy
attacked South Vietnam as he did in 1962
direct attack even with the
assassination of Jim oh well no when the
u.s. first set their support see I mean
so little there was so little opposition
to this that no one even knows what
happened but if you look back at the
record
historical and documentary record it's
not controversial in 1962 Kennedy sent
the US Air Force to start bombing South
Vietnam they did it in South Vietnamese
planes with Vietnamese markings but it
was US pilots and the u.s. equipment
scene covered he authorized the use of
napalm
he started the crop destruction programs
to keep food from the indigenous rebels
women he started to look this is a war
was very purpose no okay now that's
changed but I mean maybe somebody wasn't
significant look I can tell you because
I was directly involved well you know
you because of your position to be I
couldn't get four people in a room to
talk about I you argue about it was but
this is important about the country it
was four or five years before a
significant popular movement developed
opposing an aggressive war against
another country let's fast forward to
today right in this year there were a
huge popular protest before the war was
officially launched that's a tremendous
change in conscious and why do you think
I changed it because of the six is
because we because as it breathes it
gets wider and stronger and the change
took place because a lot of people work
very hard to make it change place the
same is true of civil rights of women's
rights of environmental issues and so on
well that's the way changes happen I
want to say something happened in Brazil
the popular movements developed that way
not by some leaders saying I agree I do
agree with you and that I'm not arguing
that but the interesting thing about
Brazil now you know which is a worthy of
a program here and he is somebody that
I'd like to I've heard him speak and
with lightness see him at the table is
is he's running he is disappointing some
of his followers there because of some
positions he's taking having to do with
the rainforest and other issues you know
why why because there are you know so
much about everything
over the last 20 or 30 years in part as
a reaction to the Democrat democratizing
tendencies of the 60s which were
worldwide right they were dramatic here
but also elsewhere there's been a
backlash part of the back it's taken
many forms one of the forms it's taken
is international economic Arrangements
which are virtually designed to
undermine democracy
well these what's called in the rest of
the world neoliberal arrangements here
it's called free trade but it's not free
trade the array of international
arrangements that's sort of formalized
in the World Trade Organization those
measures if you look at them it is well
understood that they undermine democracy
one of the first measures that was taken
in the early 70s initially here but then
everywhere was the free up flow of
financial capital I get you I need to
move on because like a few minutes
that's my point just once I won't try to
explain anything but let me just say
that if you look at these arrangements
you'll find that they undermine
democracy and they place countries in a
stranglehold in which they cannot follow
the policies of the overwhelming
majority and that's what's happening in
Brazil and that's why those disciplines
okay fine I'll move on I talked to
someone else knowing that you were
coming and they said you know I was in
each I was in Iraq recently recently and
I met no irani who said the war was a
mistake lots of them in the idea of
overthrowing Saddam even now and and
many of them wished the United States
would leave many of them have a terribly
disappointed upset opposed to the way
things are going but this person didn't
need anyone he tell me how you feel
about the use of American power in
overthrowing Saddam was it because it
violated your own sense of international
law was it because that we didn't have
it wasn't a um an evil answered question
because the assumptions are wrong okay
go ahead the United States was not in
favor of overthrowing Saddam Hussein
in fact George Bush made that explicit
said sorry a third summit a couple of
days before the invasion started bush
and Blair were there and they issued a
declaration in which Bush said even if
Saddam Hussein and his family leave the
country we're going to evade anyway and
in fact that's consistent with a
long-standing US policy you're you're
right that every I'm sure every sane
person in Iraq one of you get rid of
Saddam Hussein just like I had for
twenty years just like we all have a
murderous tyrant right why is he there
all right why wasn't he overthrown or to
ask another question why do the majority
of Iraqis the Lord when Araki's are with
the published polls Iraqis are asked
who's your favorite foreign leader the
favorite foreign leader of Iraqis
according to US run polls is President
Chirac of France who was the symbol of
opposition to the invasion George Bush
is far below layer even less below
nevertheless the same polls show say
yeah we're glad to get rid of Saddam
Hussein well if we want to think about
this we'll be able to figure out what's
happening sure they would like to get
rid of Saddam Hussein they were like
they've gotten rid of him years ago I'm
in 1991 they almost did you rid of him
but the u.s. supported Saddam so that he
could crush the rebellion which probably
would have ever thrown him and we know
why I'm not sure they support him so
that he could they they effectively
authorized him to crush the rebellion
sure that many people but let me make
one point is that I mean it clearly was
a mistake
in 1991 who was sure it was it allow him
to a rebellious phase I do too did
George Bush that goes in the state
no dick Thomas Friedman of the New York
Times think it was mistake I don't speak
for George digit Thomas tree well did
the New York did the press think it was
a mistake let's take a look back and
look at the allow him to the helicopters
and be able to crush take a look at the
analysis the analysis as to who had ads
to rise up let's take as much as the
analyses at the time
that's what we should be looking at you
know you can read it and say the New
York Times the most important newspaper
in the world their analysis was Alan
Cowell their Middle East correspondent
that much as we dislike the atrocities
there's an overwhelming consensus that
Saddam Hussein offers more hope for the
stability of the country stability the
kind of technical word stability the
country then the people who are trying
to overthrow it in other words we'd
rather have him than the people are
trying to overthrow him Thomas Friedman
maybe they were Thomas Friedman who was
a diplomatic cars chief diplomatic
correspondent wrote the best possible
solution for the United the best
possible world for the United States
would be an iron-fisted military hunter
ruling Iraq the same way Saddam Hussein
did much to the sure of this I'm sure he
didn't mean using the torture in losing
the technique yes then why did he say it
well but he may very well have believed
that was they made their way he must he
made very well first of all I'm leery of
speaking for anyone like this right
George Bush or Tom Friedman but he may
very well have meant that that Iraq
because of whatever fears he had they
would break up the balkanization of a
robber and therefore he needed a toll
array of men let's say up and then see
that means that from the point of view
of US policy makers and US commentators
it wasn't a mistake I think it was a
mistake you think but they didn't write
the the analysts and the policymakers
thought it was right well I preferred to
the neocon so you find so much fall in
their did not think it was a mistake we
don't know the wits of the world
probably don't know like it was a let's
take a look at the not too overthrown
suppose I mean they've been driven by
overthrowing Saddam since 1991 you'll
agree with that won't you no I don't buy
the notion it's just too narrow a
question let's take a look at the
Wolfowitz is of the world okay he has a
record right right his record is for
example strong support of General
Suharto who is exactly thirty Serbian
Indonesia and afterwards up until 1997 a
couple of months before so Hart that was
over
he was still praising him so hard there
was a mass murderer probably worse than
I was saying he came into power killing
a couple hundred thousand people he ran
a regime of vicious torture and
oppression he invaded East Timor
practically destroyed it
his torture and massacres were going on
right to the end of his rule Wolfowitz
was praising him because of his
contributions to the growth and
development of Indonesia that's what
served as ambassador to Indonesia this
started when he was in the State
Department with responsibility for Asia
Southeast Asia in particular went on was
he was in as ambassador to Indonesia and
it continued through his post government
service I think it was one example as in
under his watch as State Department high
official in the State Department with
responsibility for Asia the Reagan
administration under his watch supported
a whole range of murderous dictators
like Chun of South Korea I support him
I'm not sure when he came in
administration which is your point
exactly
Oh series of America administration's
support a whole series of leaders in
South Korea absolutely and Wolfowitz R
is responsible is in charge almost in
charge in a second in command in the
State Department right up to the end
Marcos back to the original record and
see what happened this book noam chomsky
hegemony or survival America's quest for
global dominance we'll talk more about
all these issues with him and others I
thank you for coming thank you very much
thank you for joining us we went the our
more to be said tomorrow night Tony
Morrison is here and others see you then
