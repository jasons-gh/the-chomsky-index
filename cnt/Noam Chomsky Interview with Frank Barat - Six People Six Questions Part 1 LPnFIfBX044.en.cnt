professor Chomsky first question comes
from jon burge a political practice
fun surprises political vocabulary for
example the recent revolution the Middle
East is said to demand democracy can we
find multi-quote worlds isn't the use of
the old and frequently betrayed words a
way of absorbing this shock instead of
were coming it and transmitting it
further well I just to begin i think the
word revolution is a bit of an
exaggeration maybe it'll turn it into a
revolution but for the moment it's a
call for moderate reform short there are
elements in it like the workers movement
that are trying to move beyond that but
that remains to be seen however is
correct but there's no way out of that
it's not just the word democracy it's
every word that is involved in
discussion of political affairs has two
meanings as its literal meaning has a
meaning that's assigned to it for
political warfare for ideology for
doctrine so either we stop talking or we
try to use the words in a sensible way
and it's not just democracy it I mean
take the word a simple word like person
sounds simple let's take a look at it
the in the United States is quite
interesting the United States has
guarantees of personal rights go beyond
maybe any other country would have a
look at them the a constant the
amendments to the Constitution a state
very explicitly that no person can be
deprived of rights was the rights
without due process of law well that was
it reappears in the 14th amendment was
in the 5th amend that undid was intended
to apply to freed slaves but it had
never been ever been applied to them the
courts narrowed the meaning and
broadened the meaning crucially they
broadened the meaning to include
corporations
fictitious legal entities established by
state power so they were given the
rights of persons by now writes way
beyond persons on the other hand was
also narrowed because the term persons
you might think that would apply to
those creatures walking around to do the
dirty work in the society but don't
happen to have documents and that
wouldn't do because they must be
deprived of rights so the courts and
their wisdom decided they're not persons
the only persons are people with
citizenship so now nonhumans corporate
entities like the Barclays Bank meeting
next door they're persons with rights
way beyond persons humans and the people
you know sweeping the streets are not
persons they don't have rights and the
same is true just about every term you
look at so it takes a free-trade
agreements for example there's a North
American Free Trade Agreement Canada the
United States and Mexico the only
accurate term in that is North American
certainly not an agreement at least if
human beings are part of their societies
because the population in all three
countries was against it so it's not an
agreement it's not about free trade in
fact it has it's highly protectionists
you know tremendous protections for
monopoly pricing rights for
pharmaceutical corporations and so on a
lot of it isn't about trade at all in
fact what we call trade is kind of a
joke so for example in the old Soviet
Union if parts were manufactured say in
Leningrad and shipped to Warsaw for
assembly and then sold and Moscow that
we didn't call that trade although it
did cross national borders it was
interactions within a single command
economy and exactly the same is true if
General Motors manufacturers the parts
and Indiana send them to Mexico for
assembly then sells them in Los Angeles
but we call that trade both ways in fact
if you look at the trade it's about
fifty percent of it not small at a lot
of the agreement is just about investor
rights say granting general motors are
the rights of national companies in
Mexico for example which Mexicans of
course don't get the United States and
it picked the term you want are you
going to find exactly the same thing so
yes that's a problem and we get around
it by trying to be clear about the way
we use our own terminology second
questions come from award-winning
journalist Chris Hedges Julian benda in
the treason of intellectuals argued that
it is only when intellectuals are not in
the pursuit of practical aims of
material advantages that they can serve
as a conscience and as a corrective can
you address the loss of philosophers
religious leaders writers journalists
artists and scholars whose lies were
once lived in direct opposition to the
realism of the multitudes and what this
has meant for our intellectual and roll
life well the only I understand his
feelings and share them but I don't know
what the loss was when was it ever true
and at no time that I can remember the
term intellectual came into pretty
common usage in the modern sense at the
time of the Dreyfus ards they were a
small minority a small vilified minority
the massive intellectual supported state
power during the First World War shortly
afterwards the intellectuals of every
one of the country's passionately
supported their own state endzone
there were a handful of exceptions like
Bertrand Russell Anglin door Rosa
Luxemburg and karl liebknecht in Germany
or Eugene Debs in the United States they
were all in jail they were a margin and
they were imprisoned yes they were there
in the John Dewey circle the liberal
intellectuals in the United States
passionately pro-war there was one
member Randolph born who didn't go along
with it he wasn't put in jail the United
States a pretty free country but he was
thrown out of the journals you know
intellectually exiled and so on that's
the way it's always been during the
1960's the activist period they take a
careful look intellectuals were very
supportive of Martin Luther King and the
civil rights movement as long as he was
attacking somebody else as long as the
civil rights movement was going after
racist sheriffs and Alabama that was
wonderful everybody praised it we talk
big I rhetoric and so on as soon as he
turned to class issues and he was
marginalized and suppressed people tend
to forget that he was killed when he was
taking part in a sanitation workers
strike and on his way to Washington to
help organize a poor people's movement
well that crosses the boundary that goes
after us because after privilege in the
north and so on so the electricals
disappeared with regard to the Vietnam
War is exactly the same thing it was
almost nope among known as looking
others of course people on the fringes
they were young people and so on but
among now well-known intellectuals and
practically nothing
at the very end after after the Tet
Offensive in 1968 when the business
community turned against the war then
you started getting a drifting of people
saying is I was always a long time Eddie
war activist no trace of it or whatever
but that's in fact he can take this back
to the earliest history I go back to
classical Greece the who drank the
hemlock a guy was accused of corrupting
the youth of Athens with false gods I'm
going to take the biblical records they
didn't have the therm intellectual but
they had a term which meant what we mean
by his lecture that it's called prophets
bad translation of an obscure he knew
word whether were so called prophets and
lecturers who carried out geo political
critique you know condemned the King for
bringing about disaster condemned the
Kings crimes called for mercy for widows
and orphans and so on what we would call
dissident intellectuals how are they
treated they were denounced as haters of
Israel it's the exact phrase that was
used the origins of the phrase
self-hating Jew in the modern period
they were imprisoned driven into the
desert and so on there were
intellectuals were praised the
flatterers of the court centuries later
they were called false prophets but not
at the time and that's almost the entire
history since there are few exceptions
in the modern period the one major
exception i know is actually turkey
that's the only country i know where the
leading prominent artists academics
journalists publishers a very broad
range of intellectuals and not only
condemned the crimes of the state but
are involved in constant silts obedience
against them facing often in during pre
severe punishment I have to laugh when I
come to Europe and your people
complaining about it
jerks aren't civilized enough to join
our advanced society could learn some
lessons from Turkey but that's pretty
unusual in fact it's so unusual that it
can it's barely known he can bring it up
but aside from the word loss I think
Chris Hedges comments are accurate but I
just can't perceive any laws I think
it's about the same as it's always been
and in fact the way in dissident
intellectuals are treated of course does
vary so in the United States let's say
maybe they're vilified or something in
the old Soviet Union same czechoslovakia
in the 1960s and 70s they could be in
prison like Havel was in prison if you
were an American domains at that time
like El Salvador he got your blinds
brains blown out by elite battalion
trained in the US Special Warfare school
so yes people are treated differently
depending on the country third question
comes from Israeli journalist amira hass
have the pricing in their Arab states
menu change revise some of the past
evaluations are they and how affected
your notions of for example masses hope
Facebook Western intervention or
surprise well actually a mirror and I
met in Turkey a couple of months ago a
couple of hours chance to talk and
neither of us and maybe she did if she
did it was a secret I certainly didn't
anticipate anything that was going to
happen in the Arab world so yes it
changed my opinion in that respect it
was unexpected on the other hand when
you look back at it it's not that
different from what's happened before
except that in the past of the uprisings
were brutally suppressed and indeed they
were this time too so the first of the
uprisings was actually in November
that was in the Western Sahara which is
occupied by Morocco 25 years ago Morocco
invaded violated UN resolutions as a
brutal occupation the in November there
was a nonviolent protest which Moroccan
troops came in and crushed violently as
they've been doing for 25 years it was
serious enough so that was brought to
the UN for a potential inquiry but
France intervened France is the primary
protector of atrocities and crimes in
western Africa it's the old French
possessions so they blocked any un
inquiry that was the first the next one
was in Tunisia again more or less French
area and there were scandals as you know
in like the minister of tourism or one
of the minister's went for a vacation
right in the middle of the uprising and
got some bad publicity but that one was
successful it throughout the dictator
then came Egypt which is the most
important because it was significance in
the Arab world and that was pretty
remarkable was a remarkable display of
courage dedication commitment it did
succeed in getting rid of the dictator
it didn't hasn't yet changed the regime
maybe it will but the regime is pretty
much in place different names the but
it's nothing new that uprising the
January 25th uprising it was led by
young people who call themselves the
April sixth movement well April sixth
hasn't for a reason april six they
picked the name because it was the date
of a major strike action couple years
earlier at the mahalo textile complex
big industrial complex that wasn't
supposed to be a major strike support
activities and so on well they were
crushed by violence that's April six
and that's only one of a series
incidentally shortly after the crushing
of the April sixth uprising President
Obama came to Egypt to deliver his
famous address outreach to the Muslim
world and so on on his way he was asked
at a press conference whether he would
say anything about the authoritarian
government of President Mubarak and he
said no he wouldn't he said Mubarak's a
good man he's doing good things he's
keeping stability like crushing the
April sixth strike and so on so that's
just fine then the uprisings went beyond
the most striking one is Bahrain that's
frightening to the west first of all
because Bahrain hosts the Fifth Fleet
the major military force in the region
US fleet a second because it's largely
Shia and it's right across a causeway
from eastern Saudi Arabia which is
majority Shiite it happens to be world
most of the oil is that gets frightening
for years Western planners have been
concerned about a kind of a geographical
and historical accident that most of the
world's oil is in Shiite areas right
around that part of the Gulf Iran
southern Iraq and eastern Saudi Arabia
well if the uprising baccarin spreads to
Saudi Arabia then Western power is
really in trouble and in fact Obama has
changed the rhetoric of
that's used officially for the talk
about the uprisings for a while it was a
regime change incidentally that's after
the uprising succeeded then kind of move
in say I was fine now its regime
alteration we don't want to change it's
too valuable to have our dictators run
things actually rather striking fact
about all of this is that you take a
look the WikiLeaks exposures pre
interestingly the ones that got the most
exposure in the West the big headlines
you for commentary were the leaks from
the ambassador's which said that the
Arab world supports us against Iran well
one thing was missing and that reaction
in the newspapers by the colonists and
others namely our of opinion what they
meant was the Arab dictators support us
it would have had our of opinion it's
known but it's not reported in the
united states 0 I think one report in
England Jonathan Steele reported it
probably nothing in France but it's it's
well-known Western the u.s. polling
agencies released by very prestigious
agencies it turns out that some Arabs
think I think he ran as a thread about
ten percent a majority a vast majority
think the major threat is the United
States and Israel in Egypt ninety
percent the United States is the major
thread in fact opposition to US policy
is so strong that in egypt i think it's
close to eighty percent think the region
be better off if Iran had nuclear
weapons over the whole region its
majority well who cares you know our
going back to John burgers term
democracy Western intellectual contempt
for democracy is so profound and deep
seated that doesn't even occur
to ask well what Arabs think when we are
you for that the Arab support us well
the answer is it doesn't matter as long
as they are quiet and subdued and
controlled as long as there's what's
called stability if no matter what they
think the dictator support us period
were you for it well okay that kind of
ties together a number of these
questions but going back to your houses
comments yeah it what's happened it does
should lead us to think about what has
been happening not on the Arab world but
elsewhere has often arisen and has been
subdued by violence and that's been true
for a century I mean the Britain the
British were suppressing and democracy
movements in Iran this over a century
ago in Iraq there was a Shiite uprising
and as soon as the British cobbled the
country together after the First World
War big uprising violently suppressed
one of the first uses uses of aircraft
to attack civilians in fact Britain was
very proud of that now the famous Lloyd
Britain succeeded in blocking a
disarmament conference in 1932 they
prevented it from barring use of
aircraft against civilians Lloyd George
famous Lloyd George wrote in his diary
that this was a great thing because we
have to reserve the right to bomb
niggers so therefore is a very good
thing that the British government did
and it continued in 1953 the United
States and Britain combined to throw out
the parliamentary government and in Iran
19 36 to 39 it was an Arab uprising
Palestine against the British and
violently crushed the First Intifada was
again a very significant popular
uprising
entirely nonviolent and a real popular
movement women's groups attacked you
know that protests against the feudal
structure try to dismantle it and so on
it was crushed by violence so sure these
things like this happened what time it's
crushed what's unusual this time is that
strong enough so it was most of the
country's ables able to sustain itself
what will happen in saudi arabia and
bahrain jordan we don't know in fact we
really don't know what will happen in
Egypt the military has so far retained
control and the top military command at
least is deeply embedded into the old
oppressive regime they own a lot of the
economy that they were the beneficiaries
of the Mubarak dictatorship they're not
going to give it up easily so it remains
to be seen what happens there next
question is from Ken Loach award-winning
filmmaker how do we overcome
sectarianism on the left I don't think
we'll ever comment for one thing one
form of sectarianism should be welcome
to mainly disagreement there are a lot
of a lot of things are quite unclear we
ought to have discussion disagreement to
pursue different options and so on but
what he means by sectarianism and what
is generally meant by it is initiatives
that sometimes attempt to and often
succeed in breaking up popular movements
so individuals or political groups that
have their own agenda and want to take
control you know become little Lenin's
and so on and so forth that kind of
sectarianism I don't think is ever going
to really be suppressed
