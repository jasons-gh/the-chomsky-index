they're well
imogen of best but there is a culture of
fear that goes way back in American
history right from the beginning you see
it in popular literature and more recent
times in movies television it's been
well studied the kind of a constant
theme in the popular culture has been
that we're on the verge of destruction
somebody is about to destroy us
and at the last minute a super hero
comes or a super weapon is invented by
great technologists and it saves us you
know that's a theme that runs through
for centuries a sub-theme
is that the enemy that's going to
destroy us is someone we're destroying
so it's the native population they're
gonna come up and wipe us out or it's
the black slaves they're just waiting
for a chance to come and murder all the
whites and rape the white women and so
on or later it's the Chinese you think
they're here to run laundries but it's
really those billions of Chinese that
are coming in here and infiltrating and
they're going to take us over and miss
troyius I mean a progressive writers
like Jack London century ago were
writing that we have to destroy everyone
in China by bacteriological warfare
to prevent their insidious aim of doing
this does later the Second World War was
quite striking it was the huns of course
and the Japs but the Huns were treated
were much more not as criminals they
were words of magnitude worse they were
treated pretty calmly this much I can
remember I mean after all they're blond
and blue-eyed and white skin it can't be
that bad
the Japanese on the other hand which is
environment I had to be crushed and
wiped out you can even read the public
literature we have to wipe out their
aunt heaps and
I'm scurrying around the environment and
so on and so forth
but they're gonna destroy us unless we
destroy them first so we gotta destroy
them and then through the Cold War you
pick up one enemy after another the Red
Chinese the Vietnamese the Hispanic
market traffickers whatever they be Iran
today he's gonna come and destroy us how
well nobody's very clear but somehow
Iran will destroy us or maybe cubital
destroy us Mandi the most minimal enemy
I mean Ronald Reagan I mean it must be
the most cowardly thug in history now
generated after a huge PR campaign in
1985 he declared a national emergency in
the United States because of the threat
to the security of the United States
posed by the government of Nicaragua
we're which had troops only two days
away from Harling in Texas so you know
Nicaragua is going to come any minute
now I'm just overwhelming if you look at
it from the outside you know whether to
laugh or cry
but this is a constant theme and it's
easily it's a sort of a steady sort of
current you know which can always be
stimulated when needed by cynical
leaders with usual public relations
techniques that when they wanted when
they decided they wanted to attack Iraq
you have Condoleezza Rice talking about
the next time we hear from Saddam
Hussein it'll be a mushroom cloud in New
York everybody's terrified and so on and
so the back and this true to an extent
in Europe to I think to the less of an
extent but it can be whipped up into
fear and paranoia and it's very real
it's an unfortunate feature of the
culture strange culture in many ways
that part of it may be related to the
fact that it's an extremely
fundamentalist society and there's
always been it's always been by far the
most fundamentalist country among
the industrial societies maybe in the
world two centuries ago there was early
days of the Republic there was a huge
wave of fundamentalist fanaticism about
how we got to quickly convert the whole
world to speak English and save their
souls the second coming and so on and it
goes on and on like that there's another
one in the 1950s or several in the 1928
century now right now about a third of
the population probably believes it
doesn't matter what we do about global
warming say because Jesus is coming
pretty soon you know and so if this
level warming what it's a difference
it's because God wants it and he's
coming soon anyway and those of us who
are saved will rise to heaven and
everyone else will be massacred and will
be wonderful that's in fact when you
look at even narrow positions like the
incredible support for Israel no matter
what it does a part of that is based on
the fact that about a same third of the
population roughly I thinks we must
support anything Israel does because
that in fact even it leads to say a
nuclear war is great because that's you
know the way we read the Book of
Revelations Armageddon and so on and so
forth and then the Second Coming takes
care of it all it's there's a deep
element of anti-semitism in this because
the Jews were going to get massacred
unless they convert but the Jewish
community and State of Israel supports
it in fact even has kinda like missions
to it because they're like what they're
getting in the short term even if they
all get wiped out after arm again these
are strong elements in the society to a
lesser extent to a lesser extent and
there are other ones that are worse in
Europe but a propaganda state propaganda
business propaganda does play on these
fears I mean it takes a Germany look
Germany in the 1920s early 30s was the
peak of Western civilization the
absolute peak in the sciences and the
arts
I was regarded as a model for democracy
by American political scientists
everything a literature but within about
three years it was turned into a country
of savage barbarians who carried out the
worst crimes in history and we're always
right at the edge
you
in fact we're doing it right now and we
don't notice it so this takes a the
invasion of Iraq I mean one of the first
things that Rumsfeld Cheney and
Wolfowitz did was wipe out the core of
Western civilization the Sumerian wrote
the site's majority of them destroyed a
military base in Babylon the national
museum looted you know I mean these are
the riches of the origins of Western
civilization I mean that's why Iraq is
regarded it is like the Mongol invasion
but it gets much worse yesterday in the
papers you read that there was a suicide
bomb and with the nabhi Street Luton RB
Street is important in Middle East
culture that was the center of
bookstores literary cafes lively
discussion in Iraq which was the most
advanced in the Arab world it went it
survived right through this a time
period it was you know debates
discussions it's kind of like the left
bank you know probably more advanced
that's Madhavi street I was practically
destroyed last year but the final blow
was the suicide bombing a couple of days
ago well one of the newspapers quoted
somebody there who they say in
reverential tones repeated an Arab
proverb well-known have para proverb
Cairo writes Beirut publishes Iraq reads
okay
Iraq's not reading we took care of that
from the Sumerians up to the present but
Kyra is still writing so if we if we can
get out of air cocoons and become
civilized we can read with the writing
in Cairo which is for example that
during the US Israeli bombing of the
Lebanon that which is us Israeli I said
because that's what it was they
specifically targeted the call
areas in Beirut they wiped that the
Centers of publishing they wiped out
centers where the bookstores are because
you must destroy the culture we really
are barbarians we must destroy the
cultures of the countries who are
attacking so now
Cairo can still write but they wrote
can't publish in Iraq can't read and
just to make sure we went all the way
back to the Sumerians yes it's a
barbaric Savage culture that we live in
this doesn't mean anything in the West
okay so we wipe out the history of
Western civilization and modern culture
who cares
but does mean something at other parts
of the world and we can't comprehend it
you know then you ask well why do they
hate us these are factors that have to
be taken into account we have to learn
enough to understand what things mean to
people in the world maybe we're too
uncivilized to see them doesn't mean
they they don't
