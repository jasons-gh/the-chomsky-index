given human rights violations by
corporations I was wondering how you
make your purchasing decisions and if
there are any products that you don't
purchase well plenty of things they
don't purchase but not really for that
reason I mean these are questions of
tactics I mean do you affect Human
Rights but let's take coca-cola which is
the big thing around here I understand
coca-cola is has just been it's narrowly
scraped by a district court case in
Florida that was brought by the Steel
Workers in support of Colombian workers
in a subsidiary of a coca-cola plant
which is one of those vicious anti-union
plants almost anywhere and the
particular case was a union activist who
was murdered by paramilitaries in the
plant and the steel workers who are
pressing these human rights cases for
Colombians they can't do it themselves
are using provisions of American law
which do exist and if sometimes it's
been applied and they've brought a case
in Florida which got to the district
court and they sort of have a half
victory the district court severed coca
cola from the case but kept the
subsidiary well you know severing
coca-cola was a technicality so does
that mean you should stop buying
coca-cola well if you stop buying
coca-cola is that going to help even in
activists in Colombia
that's the question you have to ask
these are and you know I don't think
there's a simple answer like if you stop
buying coca-cola that's not have any
effect if there was a massive boycott of
it they'd notice it in the corporate
headquarters and and might do something
like for example Nike and reap and see
little Reebok or something the guys who
make sneakers and things like that have
modified somewhat they're horrendous
human rights practices in plants in Asia
as a result of pressure what must have
been coming from students and that yeah
that had an effect but these are
questions you just
have to answer in terms of their likely
consequences for people who are
suffering there's no point making
gestures
