you said and I quote you can do good
things with the Internet the question is
whether it will still be possible to do
good things after it falls totally into
the hands of private power I wondered
whether you could comment on what you
consider to be this state current state
of the Internet and the potential of
news and information in that medium
today um briefly the Internet like
almost the entire economy the whole new
economy was developed in the state
sector there's a dynamic state sector of
the economy in the United States that's
where most innovation and creativity and
development takes place it's a perfect
device because it's socializes the risk
gets socialized the cost and if anything
comes out handed over to private power
that's called free enterprise the
Internet is a good example it was in the
state sector for about 30 years it was
handed over to private power around 1995
in some manner that nobody has been able
to on earth yet it was just done and
it's led to changes in fact Norman media
critic Norman Solomon wrote a did a
study where he looked at the references
to the Internet before and after the
transfer of private power and before the
transfer the main references to the
internet were information superhighway
after the transfer it was ecommerce okay
that's one of the effects of
transferring to private power a public
creation now ever since then there's
been a struggle and it goes on as to
whether the internet is going to be a
free and open system or whether there
will be ways to control it so as to
divert people away from what they might
be interested in and into the directions
that the corporations that own it and
funded want them to
so if you look something up you know you
won't find something I don't know
whatever it is first you have to wade
your way through a pile of ads that are
coming and you know don't go down the
path they're trying to take you through
and so on and so forth you know these
are all that's part of the struggle you
know what you're looking for you can
still find it but it's but there are of
course going to be efforts made to make
it harder and harder on the other hand
there's a struggle that keep it more and
more open and it's like meet other parts
of the media know it's a terrain
struggle how it turns out depends on
what people like you do about
