how should we think about Geneva 2 and
the Syrian crisis considering that
considering that Saudi Arabia is opposed
to any kind of deal and the US and
Russia have have kind of made out a plan
where the Assad government would stay in
intact intact and also that the deputy
foreign minister of Saudi Arabia has
reported to have visited Israel recently
and we can only think that their agenda
is there Iran crisis well but I think
the Saudi is really the relationship is
developing on the basis of opposition to
Iran it doesn't really have to do with
Syria Israel has shown no indication
that it wants the rebels to win in Syria
nor incidentally does the United States
I mean if the United States and Israel
were committed to an overthrow of the
Assad government there are things they
could do far short of sending arms
nothing country or bombing and nothing
controversial for example they would
suffice for Israel to mobilize forces on
these old on Heights which Israel
occupies and as annexed and violation of
Security Council orders the Syrian
territory very close to Damascus if
Israel mobilized forces there the Syrian
government would be compelled to move
sort forces to the south relieving
pressure against the rebels
that's one very simple thing that could
be done but there's no talk of it
because there's no interest in having
the Assad government fall as far as
Israel is concerned it's pretty happy
just to see Syrians kill each other and
there's no indication that they want to
change that with the Syrian crisis looks
like a mysterious plunging into total
suicide it's an utter disaster and the
only small hope and it's very small is
for some negotiated settlement of the
Geneva type exactly what
it's hard to imagine that any settlement
would not allow some physician for the
Assad government in a transitional stage
that's kind of a minimum condition under
which they would even participate but
whether it but it's it's very hard to
see if the rebels can even find
representation that would appear in
Geneva or even if they want to it's so
it's a very shaky possibility but it's
actually the only one that I can see
that at any hope of saving Syria from a
plunge to even worse catastrophe than
today
I mean what's happening in Syria is that
the country is just being partitioned
the Kurdish areas have formally declared
autonomy they've been battling with the
rebels in fact and possibly they might
seek some kind of link to Iraqi
Kurdistan although that's tenuous as
well the rest of the country is
basically divided between the government
and rebel forces and welding lines shift
it doesn't look like either it's going
to defeat the other it's it's a terrible
situation um do you think that we're
kind of witnessing a transformation in
US political aspiration in the Middle
East and like with this deals with
Russia and also and could you also
comment on Russia Russians role in the
world right now and and also what's
going on with Iran I mean they're
they've made a interim deal now they've
like what we just talked about is Geneva
and there's there's a deal that they
might keep this intact and well the Iran
question is actually somewhat separate
although of course in the background
there's a growing split which was very
much exacerbated by the Iraq invasion a
Sunni Shia split which is now spread
over the region and is consuming it
that's happening in Syria as well with
and kind of on one side and Saudi Arabia
and Qatar on the other but and Iraq is
just being torn to shreds I mean just
today there were another dozens of
people murdered she had pilgrims on
their way to Karbala that every day has
more atrocities this is and in fact
there was just now the first fatwa by a
leading Shia cleric he's actually based
in Iran but it's Iraqi and it's
connected the Iraqi solder facade rest
versus a fatwa authorizing the Shiites
and Iraq and Iran to the fight in Syria
that's another escalation of the of the
war and of the Sunni Shia split with
regard to Iran there's a separate it's a
separate issue and I mean Iran in the
West in the United States and its allies
in particular Israel Iran has described
as the gravest threat to world peace
because of its nuclear programs but it's
worth bearing in mind that that's a
Western obsession it's not true of the
world the non-line countries which is
most of the world have vigorously
supported it runs right to enrich
uranium as a signer that
unprofessionally t they just did so
again recently at a unlined conference
in tehran if you go to the arab world
nearby while the Arab dictators are very
much opposed to the Iran and its
policies of the population that has a
different view actually there's a recent
study that there have been many poll
Western polls there's a recent book that
just came out summarizing them by should
little homie the leading Western the
specialists on our public opinion and he
includes as other polls have shown that
well in the Arab world the population
doesn't like Iran these
hostilities that go back centuries they
don't regard Iran as a threat a very
small percentage regard Iran as a threat
the threat that they see the population
is the United States and Israel that's
quite different from the Western image
that's presented the Pacific image the
images presented in the West is that the
Arabs support the United States in
opposition to Iran's programs but that's
a reference to the Arab dictators not to
the population which has doesn't like
Iran that doesn't doesn't agree with
this and it raises a real question what
the threat is supposed to be what is
what makes around the greatest threat
the world these actually we have an
authoritative answer to that from US
intelligence and the Pentagon which
regularly briefed Congress on the global
security and it's a little public you
can find the documents on the web what
they say is that Iran is not a military
threat it has a very low military
spending even by the standards of the
region it has almost no capacity to
deploy force it has not been engaged in
aggressive acts but it is a potential
deterrent and that's the threat
