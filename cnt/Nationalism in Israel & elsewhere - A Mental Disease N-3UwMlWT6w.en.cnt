nationalism of one kind or another was
the cause of most of the genocide of the
20th century
flags are bits of colored cloth that
governments use first to shrink-wrap
people's brains and then as ceremonial
shrouds to bury the dead quite generally
it goes right through history
intellectuals have been servants of
power take say the First World War on
all sides of Germany England the United
States and France intellectuals were
extremely enthusiastic about the war
that there were a few dissenters and the
best-known of them ended up in jail like
Bertrand Russell for example or Eugene
Debs in the United States or Rosa
Luxemburg in Germany very small group of
critics some of them best-known
imprisoned but most intellectuals were
enthusiasts for their own country and
that's common and it remains common
I mean intellectuals write history so
you have to be a little cautious about
what they say about themselves it is
only natural that those on top of a
hierarchy will try to limit public input
by creating conflict and division that
is by promoting unity only as it relates
to a uniform support for elite ideology
in action and it's only natural that
violence and deceit will be used to
suppress the freedom instinct of the
masses after all if the subordinate
majority ever unites elite power could
be jeopardized in fact not only do power
structures create situations where we
oppress each other but they create
situations where we defend and become
attached to our own oppressors in other
words those at the top of a hierarchy
become part of us like an extension of
our egos the most obvious example of a
hierarchical power structure having this
effect is the state warship of the state
has become a secular religion in which
the intellectual serve as a priesthood
the more primitive sectors of society go
further fostering forms of idolatry in
which such sacred symbols as the flag
become an object of forced veneration
while Godin state are linked in public
ceremony in discouraged
