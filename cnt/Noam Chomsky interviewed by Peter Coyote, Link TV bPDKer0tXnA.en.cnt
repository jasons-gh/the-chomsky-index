so much former Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the army van head US
military officials say US and British
warplanes on patrol the war because by
the way is more so
we interviewed professor Noam Chomsky at
MIT on the military industrial complex
and other related issues for you who are
not familiar with him Noam Chomsky is a
professor of linguistics from MIT he's
received 23 honorary doctoral degrees
from universities all over the world
let's go to a piece of that interview
now the military industrial complex
is actually a core part of the American
economy it's and the military spending
is has been for years if in fact goes
way back that escalated after the Second
World War has been a kind of cover for
economic development and there's some
pretty simple reasons for it just as
there were in the development of
computers and the internet the public
pays the costs and the public takes the
risks so questions that market issues
don't arise and if therefore it can be
as costly as you like you can risk
anything you like the public's paying
for it the public thinks it's paying for
its defense these are ways of hiding the
costs of future profit by making the
public pay for them
back to the Noam Chomsky
a minute and listen to Noam Chomsky talk
about Empire well the country was
founded in the 18th century as
essentially an imperial Republic the
goals were imperial the term meant
something different than that it does
now so we should be careful using it but
the conception was that of the founding
fathers that the US would sooner or
later come to control the hemisphere now
this was not put that way we would be a
beacon of light that would lead the
hemisphere towards greater things but
then every Imperial system puts it that
way including ones we don't want to
remember you know Hitler Stalin Japanese
fascists and so on very noble and
generous and uplifting rhetoric
accompanied the worst atrocities what's
your response to those who insist that
we should assume the burden of empire
and not be embarrassed by it I would ask
what the world thinks about this does
the world want us to pursue the policies
that the Chuckle neo cons and government
are demanding that we pursue the answer
to that is as clear as it can be they
have aroused enormous hostility around
the world unprecedented hostility to
their actions now if they feel that they
have a right to carry out those actions
no matter no matter what the world
thinks about it don't call it the burden
of leadership call it the you know the
pleasures of domination
can you imagine a way in which our
economy could go on an anti Imperial
diet without causing massive social and
economic disruptions it would cause
massive social and economic improvement
and if we weren't putting you know half
trillion dollars a year into the
military system including massive
efforts which are harming us like the
nuclear weapon system alliteration of
space actions that increase terror and
so on
we took that away and dealt with our
domestic social problems we'd be much
better off under domestic this is a very
rich country with enormous advantages
nevertheless there's problems with
schools as problems with health there's
problems with the quality of life
there's serious potential problems with
a livable environment for our
grandchildren
there are energy problems all of these
are very serious problems to be dealt
with and they're not going to be dealt
with by in the authorizing by putting
space platforms which can be used to
destroy any part of the world
instantaneously with lethal weapons
that's not gonna solve this problems
because there's more problems may
destroy it and the final word tonight
goes to a Republican a former general
and former President Dwight Eisenhower
who on April 16th 1953 said every gun
that's made every warship launched every
rocket fired signifies in the final
sense of theft from those who hunger and
are not fed and those who are cold and
are not clothed
