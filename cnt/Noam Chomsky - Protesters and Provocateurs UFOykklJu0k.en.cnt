needle with each year and in our series
the Scottish trekking obsessed with
anarchists and fenestration police to be
perfect in all sorts of rumors about
what might happen including support
attacks in the parliament and all sorts
of ideas smears and in particular by the
things that we sustain is that they're
going to have access to rather a plastic
bullets to what can what from Belgium to
thousands of police imported from the
border and one of the things that
suggest to our systems is that they are
trying to frighten wave demonstrators
from comical needles twenty Blair is
they insist Gilliam's unreal that he
doesn't know why he would ever speak
again to you but the entire agenda is
for the good of humanity
Africa is climate change cetera
what my GBC in response I do what does
obviously didn't do car media and
supporting challenge the police make
sure that the time showed demonstrations
were peaceful to attract more water to
people before was if the past as any
guidance the only guide we have I would
suspect reading his area about good
Angus violence and rain in police and so
on is probably provocation and they like
nothing more than to provoke the violent
confrontation that puts the issues
and then Yolanda bother with the issues
that the protesters are raising and you
can talk about the fact that somebody
threw a stone at a bank window and in
the past even ease demonstrations but
traditionally a large part of the
violence provoke is productors
internal you know in general for example
that turned out that a lot of the
violence was just police provocation in
general to the people who sort of put on
a cute the style clothes and then were
discovered a couple of days later at the
local police station now that's quite
typical and not just here with generally
so for example in Algeria and the 1990s
there was tremendous violence attributed
to Islamic fundamentalists but it turned
out on investigation that the typical
act of actually there was a study done
by expatriate Algerian physicists some
of them one of them in Oxford one of
them at MIT which is I got to know about
it in which they just did a careful
analysis of the massacres now G RIA and
published a big volume about it which
incidentally was banned in France
interest of freedom what they discovered
was that the typical massacre would be
in a refugee camp where people dressed
up as kind of Hollywood versions of an
Islamic fundamentalist would come into
the camp and spend three days as
slaughtering everybody the camp would be
maybe a kilometer away from a major
military base took the
and after the place was wiped out and
hundreds of people were killed so on six
months later Zhaan general would
countenance
by a plan for 25 cents and the Builder
fancied Thursday fell or something like
that and it also claimed that the French
intelligence was involved directly
France never gave up Algeria they just
tried to reconstruct their control of it
in other ways economic political and
standard devices of Western society
things with pioneers of intelligence and
security penetration to carry out
provocations
well that's been typical of the big
demonstrations forever remembered very
well in the 1960s by the 1960s I was
involved very much an organizing
resistance and the resistance groups
were not really invested in any deep way
that we did things that we do not
probably know but every group knew their
learning very quickly that you cannot
have you can just talk about anything
serious in a meeting which includes say
seven or eight people it was one or two
of them will be an informant
so everything serious that had to be
done was done with affinity groups small
groups of people not each other you can
trust the difference
and that's true of just that everything
so I assume it's very likely true here
too and the trying to build up an
atmosphere of tension will both tend to
provoke the violence that they're hoping
for and if it doesn't build it
themselves that's what at least for lack
of theories are for it's an old
tradition of street force what the
protest I mean player is statement again
like a beauty apologizing I thought
about it we know what g8 it's not a
carry-on organization and the protesters
had something very important to say and
no to get it across one of the methods
of preventing them from doing it will be
to create an atmosphere of violent
confrontation in this case you can talk
about some throwing and ignore the
significant points that are being
brought out but the demonstrators should
have their pursue their own agenda
actually this is extremely typical of
losev and there's a long history of this
you take a look a little history of the
external imperialism or internal
domestic control so it always thought
always turns into a matter of a
confrontation between two kinds of
strength and one is political strength
the other is military strength under the
imperial powers had military strength
but not political strength that's an ads
of a population domestically and whether
it's union organizing or you know
protests about the government policies
or whatever it's the public that has
political strength is the power centers
that have
means of the island and that just
extends to almost everything and it
means that a very natural you know the
proper tactic for those in powers they
try to shift everything to the arena of
violence because that's where the strong
and the proper tactic for everyone
analyst system shift matters the media
to the domain of the issues and the
principles and so on because that's
where they're strong and I suspect that
what you're describing is just the
preliminary stages of trying to shift
the entire event to the domain of clowns
where force state power is overwhelming
and shifted away from the arena of
debate and discussion where state power
is very weak and have to be expected and
reactive
