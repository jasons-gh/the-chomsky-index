I work for a union that represents a lot
of people in Canadian newspapers and
radio and television one of the things
we see occurring is a fragmentation
particularly of the advertising market
but also for circulation and the viewers
of this media and I wonder if you agree
with that and what implications it has
for that idea of having agenda-setting
media and only necessary to have a mass
media that are important media that our
agenda setting and the other does
fragmentation offer us opportunities in
terms of alternative media and being
able to to get a message out how do you
prove you well I don't know the details
about Canada though I can't imagine it's
very different from the United States
and other countries and the main fitness
leads towards mega-mergers so the the
number of separate hate stay independent
because they're all more or less name
anyway but the number of separate news
vs. is decline has been declining for a
long time and it's declining even more
now like when you start kidding you know
Disney ABC or whatever it is all of
these things are turning into real
mega-mergers and this is just part of
what's going on and the business world
altogether there's a big move towards
kind of negative core / Asians is a
pinky merger frenzy yeah it's partly
because it's how much financial capital
floating around its property is pretty
destructive for the economy but that's
the way things are going and it's pretty
strikingly true in the media as well
even internationally I saw like I just
came back from indeed a couple of weeks
ago and the big talk question there is
whether the meat which are pretty right
wing by and large should they resist
takeovers by Murdoch guys
that which what will happen if they do
what's called liberalizing the economy
liberalizing the economy means letting
the guys with really big money do
everything and kick everybody else out
because that's the way the markets work
so when should they sort of give away
the Indian media to Murdoch and write
black and these other characters and the
big empires that they run like
ultimately major corporations like you
know Disney and Warner and so on now one
another part of that is cutting back on
news so it's hardly true that news is
beat that news coverage is being cut
back nudists offices are being cut back
there is less coverage but that's kind
of like you know it's like the reason
I'm late today as that which domain do
with whether it had to do I ultimately I
do it deregulation of the airline's of
you back burn one effect with the
regulation of the airlines has been to
transport costs to the public in fact a
lot of automation has that character
automation you know they tell you it's
saving money it's certainly saving money
for businesses but if you think about it
it's transferring the cost and you know
it very well I just asked about your own
experiences you have to do you call a
newspaper to get your subscription
change or something are calling the
airline to get a reservation well you
know they carry you through a lot of you
know if you through menu then you push
buttons that you wait and they play
pretty music ya gotta book you know
take a half an hour to get through and
the same is true of just the way the
airline industry is run the seats are
closer they don't take care of the
planes you know you try to keep right at
the margin because you can make more
profit and all of that does make more
profit but it just transfers the costs
and as far as the economy is concerning
I mean nobody measures the costs to
human beings so you can't get a number
but it's not clear that you know that
it's is not even clear that the benefits
of automation outweigh the costs if you
think about it well that's part of the
reason for cutting back news I mean you
get more a bigger advertising budget if
you if it's a no no gory murder or
something like that or whatever people
watch then if it's the news program the
advertising aren't that much interested
in advertising on the news programs so
therefore just partly advertiser driven
and partly for other reasons news is
being an commentary and discussion and
that sort of thing is being cut back
also news and commentary and discussion
have a kind of a dangerous aspect to
them they are to some extent to
democratizing that it's they tend to
some extent at least get people involved
in what's going on and the goal is to
keep people atomized keep them out of
the public arena so let's have a watch
you know one of these shows where people
will talk about their personal lives or
something then they're not being trouble
at all then they're just going to become
atoms of consumption the sort of utopia
on anything to get back to you but
remember there is a sector of the
population it does have to have
information and knowledge and so on the
management classes decision-making
classics the ownership glasses and the
the real elite press I don't think is
changing very much for them like The
Wall Street Journal New York Times and
The Washington
you have sector Alan thinks really going
to change much because they go to a very
and they are the endings to do this
heading meeting on the other hand the
rest of the media they may very well go
the way of the day the tabloids the
mirror and son it takes eight Britain
and we're back in the 1960s the two big
tabloids the mirror in the Sun they were
labor papers with a lot a lot of
craziness you know woman with two heads
and that's sort of business but a lot of
lot of moves and information and a kind
of a kind of social democratic point of
view on the world and labor oriented and
so on now it's just like you know the
National Enquirer the thing with you
watch for laughs when you're going out
at the supermarket but the end it plus
the racing forms and you know whatever
else you can you can sort of manipulate
people with once you've driven them out
of once you've driven any out of their
heads in any idea of solidarity and
cooperation and working for a better
life for your own getting involved in
the political system or and so on so
that I suppose we'll continue and
because unless you know people who like
Gus and others like this stop it but the
natural tendency would it be for to go
in that direction so it's a kind of
fragmentation but I think it'll leave
the agenda-setting mediator the elite
media not all that different because
they do serve a function you know the
indoctrination function and also this
the informing function for the
decision-making sectors of the
population that how about alternatives
whether plenty of alternatives opening
up and unfortunately they haven't I
think you know people like us haven't
used them as they take cable television
that has allowed for some years now
plenty of options the way the laws work
in the United States at least
communities that in order to get a cable
contract say you know
brothers or one of those guys has to
commit to in a particular say in boston
they have to commit some resources to
community cable which means that places
like Cambridge and Chelsea and some are
building on the little towns around now
they actually have cable stations with
the equipment and things that people
could do something with and they're just
not used I mean they are not going to
come you know they're not economy on a
scale of the network's but there are
ways to reach people and if they're not
being used it's our fault you know there
are ways to do it some people do but
nowhere near what the what has been
possible and that it was true of other
kinds of other kinds of information
technology it allows a lot of options
and I'm has been used and that's partly
because the left and the labor movements
have abandoned a lot of the turf that
they ought to be developing there's some
a lot of soul searching that ought to be
done in my opinion about these matters
i'm sure there's big forces out there
that are trying to destroy you but
there's plenty there's a lot of
opportunities that aren't being taken
the new telecommunication stuff is
another case in point it's going to be
interesting how that develops is going
to make a big difference like the rest
of high tech it was all publicly funded
so the telecommunications systems
including the internet and everything
else audibly publicly run because they
were funded by the public that mostly
through the Pentagon system the way
everything else goes now of course by
now like say computers are you know they
are planes or anything else what's
called private enterprise meaning
publicly subsidized public private
profit enterprise we go free enterprise
they want to take it over just like they
took over radio and television and print
and everything else and they tell you
what they're going to do with
it's not a big secret they want to turn
it into more ways of atomizing and
marginalizing people and making them
were stupid and ignorant passive and
obedient and so on so turn it into a
home shopping service day or you know
some some other form of you know I could
remember of particle a couple of years
ago I think was in the wall street
journal or somewhere where they were
describing the fantastic potential of
the internet because interact or all the
interactive stuff and that the idea sort
of was like this is from memory amazed
by now I may be remembering my retelling
of the story but it was something like
this the the population was broken up
into two categories women and men and
for women it would be home trapping
service so you're sitting there looking
at the screen alone and of course not
talking to anybody you're sitting alone
in a dark room looking at the screen
just you in the pr industry and somebody
something is shown on the screen which
you don't want but of course the whole
advertising industry is designs it free
and has been for hundreds of years to
design and create once to make you think
I got to have that or else something
terrible will happen like you know I
won't look like the model or whatever
you're supposed to be so all this stuff
pours in at you maybe as the children or
and certainly women is and they're going
to be trapped into once this is
interactive you don't even have to go to
the store you just push a button and you
know pretty soon something arrives at
your door or something so that's for
women what about for men well for men
they had a different idea also using the
interactive character every red-blooded
American male is supposed to be sitting
with a six-pack watching professional
football games alone of course that's
very important and the way it is now you
can just sort of watch and cheer and
scream and you know yell at the coach or
whatever you do
but since this is interactive it's now
going to be possible to ask the whole
you know 150 million man audience what
they think the next play you ought to be
like do you think it ought to be a pass
or you know cake or something really I
never got to push a button and say what
they think it ought to be and then it
doesn't have any effect on what happens
you know then the play is what it is but
they will then put on the screen you
know sixty-eight percent said it ought
to be a password so that's the
interactive technology for men and for
women its home shopping and for children
is just you know it's crap men destroy
their mind and so on yeah sure that's
what if that would make perfect sense I
mean if you were a high-paid PR you know
in some public relations office isn't
that what you would be thinking I mean
that's what you ought to be doing I so I
could become that or one variant of that
or other or it could be something that
really is does bring people together in
certain ways I think it's double-edged
even the good side of it because at best
it's bringing separated people together
in a medium that doesn't involve
personal interaction so like we're human
beings you know we're not from Mars or
something and there's a big difference
between face-to-face contact and the
virtual reality contacting somebody
somewhere who maybe doesn't exist except
in your mind and so on that has its
negative side even its best on the other
hand it is a way of and has been used
pretty efficiently in fact to mobilize
people to get information to them they
wouldn't get otherwise to
it's been a spur to significant action
actually takes a east timor which is me
I've been working on three years the
change in the scale of the popular
movement after the technology came in is
very traumatic I mean before that it was
a matter of waiting for your friends in
Australia tamez and clippings now lots
of information is around very fast and
people are doing good things with it and
this is largely because a few people
like Charlie shiner and white plains are
using it intelligent it can be done and
it can have a positive effect and there
are a lot of things like that so it's a
you know what happens to it is going to
depend on the interaction of corporate
power and popular forces and I don't
think it's predictable anymore it was
predictable day with radio or television
or a cable or anything else it's
something that can be worked on so are
there other alternatives plenty of them
I mean for example now it's possible to
with the desktop publishing it's
possible to publish extremely cheaply
something like say is the magazine is
published literally by two people it
would have taken a big staff and you
know angels and so on and so forth just
a couple of years ago and the tech in
fact of the third world of technology is
incredible sounds hi tech but in fact
for third world countries desktop
publishing is a dream it's very cheap
it's way cheaper than printing presses
and all this sort of thing and it
enables a few people to do it even in
their spare time sometimes and the same
is true here it offers lots of
possibilities and the I think it's true
of technology in general it really
offers less possibilities depends who's
got their hand on the lever to what
extent is the General Electric
influencing American nuclear weapons
policy General Electric a nuclear
weapons policy
no I mean I don't think they care much
to the truth I mean as long as in fact
takes a nuclear power right now they're
not interested in pushing it very much
and the reason is it's not
cost-effective on nuclear weapons policy
frankly doubt that the board of
directors of GE cares a lot one way or
another I may be wrong but I don't see
why they should care we were just
talking about it in schooling and we
learned that they do in about a story we
were talking about that issue in school
and we learned that they do influence
sure I can they are influencing foreign
policy I mean Gigi yeah oh they're
influencing foreign policy re not
foreign policy but nuclear weapons
policy and that they have a big nuclear
weapons industry well they sort of the
way and they certainly are not on a GE
but lots of other corporations are part
of the nuclear system and make money
from it and so on and so forth but I
really don't think it's a major issue
for them now they don't care about the
nuclear weapons but they might care
about his nuclear power but right now
that for just business reasons doesn't
look very cost effective remember that
oil the price of oil is now down to
about what I think about what it was in
the fifties it's very cheap now in fact
it is part of the reason for the
sanctions on Iraq just to keep more oil
from getting into the market because so
they don't want to price to go down to
low price goes down stool oh it starts
harming the American economy because the
air energy companies are American and a
lot of money pours in your recycle Petro
dollars so it's always been has always
been an effort to try to keep oil prices
within a certain band
do I not tulo now they're getting too
low but one effect of that is that one
consequence of that is that nuclear
power is not economical as far as I'm
aware at least the big corporations are
not all that interested in pushing it
you can even see cutbacks and vs. rather
significant setbacks and funding for the
longer term possible you know for the
long term longer term possibilities for
nuclear power like the you know the
whole things that are on the border are
being cut back the big reactors a vision
research stuff like that which simply
means that the big corporations are
right now don't see as I priority i
think they may change their mind but you
know i don't i'm really speculating i
don't have any more information about
that you do but i don't see what it
should be much interested in nuclear
weapons policy and I'm not aware of any
thing specific good evening my name is
Corky day and I've long worked in the
alternative media bill asked earlier if
the fragmentation of the media could be
good you said the situation was more of
concentration of the media but in the
alternative media we are being
fragmented aren't we as alternative
journalists spreading ourselves too
thinly and wouldn't we be better off
with fewer but stronger and bigger
alternative carriers who I I didn't
realize that the question was about
alternative me I thought it was about
the mainstream media soave obscene but I
yeah okay let's talk about the
alternative me well there is plenty of
fragmentation but now let me make flips
paper unashamed lengths I mean one thing
that's going on is a lot of
very local very special issues sort of
things which don't interact much with
one another that kind of fragmentation
may reflect something that at some level
healthy that is interested in a wide
range of things but it's an old I don't
think it's a very healthy phenomenon in
general I think that's in fact why
you're getting things like the Buchanan
phenomenon it's part of the the the core
concerns of great many people and
rightfully have been sort of abandoned
by fragmentation of special interests on
the left if that's what you mean I think
yes something to worry about yes yeah
that's part of it right in fact i'd
strongly agree with it that's why
somebody like Buchan and can come in and
pick you know just basically pick up
slogans that he's taken from the left
and turn them into a monstrosity because
the people ought to be doing it aren't
there are many of them engage their many
of them and they're engaging good things
but very narrowly focused often and off
the main tract of most people's
concerned that's the problem I think
it's been a significant problem I've
written about it for quite a while and
spoken about a lot myself but I've
always felt I felt for a long time if
it's a serious problem and one that
people who regard themselves you know
who feel that you know they are part of
the effort to extend justice and freedom
things that are called the left they
ought to really be worried about I'm
thinking about sorry are you encouraging
them to get together more
only in the sense that i'm trying to do
it now I mean I think it's not I think
it's it I think it's a dangerous
tendency and you got to overcome it from
within so yes if that's encouraging
shirt I think good it would seem to me
that nope I mean you know I don't know
like I'm not suggesting a party line or
anything I don't encourage in that sense
but I do think it's a question of
fundamental importance and I think the
left has very much harmed itself by not
taking it seriously and is causing
serious harm in society at large of
which something like the Buchanan
phenomenon is a reflection I mean there
was a section of the Nazis that did the
same thing you know the left wing the
left wing of the Nazis had slogans of
the left and may well have meant but
they worked them into this craze the
more general system and that's what you
find in that you can in phenomenon he
really is appealing to people upon too
many people on issues that they have
every right to be concerned about and
nobody else was talking any sense to
them so that wasn't this crazy stuff it
would seem to me that a public education
is a major tool could be a potential
major tool for manufacturing consent
she's the term for dissent you know it's
kind of like technology it depends what
you do with it yes I mean the public
education system at least in the United
States was set up pretty much as a
socializing system it was really set up
primarily to sort of take independent
farmers and put it in the factory
something almost like that actually
emerson ones that we're educating them
to keep them from leaping at our throats
and strangling us which is what they
might do if they knew what's going on
like that but it doesn't have to be like
that educate educate you can be very
liberating and here in bc we're looking
at cutting we're looking at cutting back
charter school funding from minify the
home schoolers from minimal to none and
as well the public education system by
the latest poll by the Ministry of
Education shows that 12 you know 4.2
percent of grade 12 graduates feel
uncared for and where 11.2 percent of
great told graduates feel that what
their lung is unwell irrelevant one of
the dangers in cutting back education
education funding to also calls are
alternatives that want to pop up what
kind of a parent is to me Oh anything
from something like the Sudbury Valley
School to private schools or to private
Catholic schools I mean well you know
that there's something there's kind of
like a fundamental point to face and
that is as human beings do we only care
that like the what am I supposed to only
care that my children get educated or am
I supposed to care that the kids down
the street get educated you know that's
you know that's a question that cuts
goes across the board on every issue
there is a very powerful you know
extraordinarily powerful part of the
entire sort of capitalist ideology is
making you worry only about yourself
lose any connection to other people
destroyed solidarity just leave
solidarity in the hands of the investing
class the rest of you just worry about
yourself this goes way back you read the
working-class press and 1850 and round
the places like where I live you know
which was in round New England which was
the center of the early Industrial
Revolution it was very lively
working class press run biomechanics and
what they call factory girls that young
women off the farms and so on a very
interesting reading but one of the
things that they were denounced it was
exactly this tendency the what they call
the new spirit of the age gain wealth
for getting all but self which they
regarded as degrading and demeaning and
destroying you know their human values
and so on correctly in fact the labor
movement throughout his whole history's
been fighting against this work together
you know because we're all in it
together we want to help each other
that's a very different ethic as its
traditional ethic it took modern
capitalism to even questioning but and I
think that what questions is very
antique human well that shows up in
connection with schools it comes down to
the question do I care whether the kids
down the street get an education well I
think we should you know I think we
should care that the occurrence but
notice that means that means public
education
