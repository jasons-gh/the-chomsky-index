it seems indisputable that we're facing
an ecological crisis and there are
obviously different currents within the
radical left in terms of addressing it
one current within anarchism known as
Ana cook or narco primitivism
associated with John series and
derekjjensen argues that the only way
for the planet to survive is if we go
back to the pre-industrial societies or
even pre agrarian societies what do you
think of that kind of that's a factual
claim I mean if they have to be right
then we have to be in favor of
mass genocide on a scale that has never
even been compliment you know
contemplated okay what happens to the
six billion people around they can't
live in a Stone Age society or an
agricultural society so if that factual
claim happens to be correct we're lost
it's not a prescription for action I
mean nobody nobody's proposing a course
of action seriously that'll lead us to a
pre-industrial Society I mean you
couldn't get ten people to even listen
to you suggested that for a good reason
that means mass genocide so it's not a
prescription it's a factual claim which
I doubt it's correct but if it happens
to be correct fine never lost
