my guest today is one of America's
foremost intellectual a free thinker the
son and a fanatical dissident to others
why did he reject the bombing in
Afghanistan and why did he share bin
Laden's views about the crimes America
committed Noam Chomsky everyone welcome
to the program glad we're here why do
you believe it was unlawful for the
United States to fight back against a
foreign attacker it wouldn't have been
unlawful to fight against the foreign
attacker but it is unlawful to carry out
revenge actions we got the fight back
though they went I was al Qaeda in the
world first of all ahead and identified
al Qaeda as the source but secondly
international law does not permit that
it does not permit retaliatory acts it's
pretty clear actually the Charter cases
with international law a permit use the
force went authorized specifically by
the United Nations treaty Council which
didn't happen or this is article 51 in
self-defense against an armed attack
until the Security Council is able to
act but what itself because is not
Italian and you respect if you expect
another attacks occasion you want to
invoke Article 51 you carry it if you
feel Isis being bombed let's say it can
fight back instantly notify the Security
Council passed the Security Council to
act and defend itself until Wysteria
Council act it was both it did not
approach the Security Council the reason
is they didn't notice this does not
refer to retaliation against bombing so
for example when the United States
carries out an attacking
Nicaragua nicaragua's not entitle the
set of funds get in Washington I have
sent to live out the New York Post but
of al Qaeda literature and then you
could retaliate
you could retaliate what's the
difference because you knew that the
missiles came from Russia and you had
repelled excited music come from al
Qaeda yeah I guess but it was right
wasn't it we don't know whether it was
right it doesn't make any difference
that he did it further texts Enki well
the fact that he said afterwards that he
knew about it tells you nothing and
almost irrelevant because we calculated
it was on number of casualties from the
animated be killed by the dish line
which means that he took credit for it
several months later but if someone
takes credit for something several
months later that does not authorize an
attack before evidence is presented but
this entire discussion is irrelevant if
the United States wanted to observe
international law it was there was a
very easy way to do it then we go to
Security Council I'd get a resolution
authorizing the use of force which it
certainly could have done it got a
resolution on September the 12th we just
accounts of readiness to take all the
readiness to respond any this but it did
not authorize the use of force so we may
have these academic discussions about
you know the intent of article 51 and it
actually I think the answer is article
51 doesn't apply that it's kind of
irrelevant because all you have cut
through all of this very simply by
requested by proposing a resolution
which would unambiguously
and clearly authorize the use of force
all of this is as clear a statement as
you can imagine that we do not want to
follow international law we are telling
the world we do not defer to any
authority you expert that Miss Perfect
Center us the USD that it was in a
position of somebody who wakes up in the
middle of the night sighs the man
standing of them with a hammer
approaches you would like me to approach
the police where the police are not the
man with the hammer - wait - no no
that's not I'm sorry that's not the way
it works
you can defend yourself against the man
with the hammer and call the police and
ask them to take it while you do is now
you keep defending yourself from the
ongoing attack you call the police you
ask them to take over if you think you
know who carried out the attack you find
evidence you can call for the equivalent
of extradition which would be turned
over from the next district all of this
the United States and Britain for what
we refuse to do because they are telling
the world loud and clear we do not defer
to any authoritative you say what we
want to check to this the world in
effect did it the leading mafia don in
town says I'm going Patton wants to pick
somebody up he doesn't get a court order
he goes and sends his goons to pick him
up and nobody checks they're free
what was the wrong with what bush did he
stopped he thought he consulted he
attempted to field an international
consensus what was wrong about you you
asked a different question you forward
to the other night were you wrong with
with it right to act in violation of law
to just attack well I think we wrong
because I I agree back in self-defense
we're going to do what you guys want
efficacious as you don't accept it but
the nor do you now you know let's try it
the United a matter what I think
well let's let's try it the United
States clearly let's make a
uncontroversial case because we have a
World Court decision of Security Council
resolution the United States tacna
garage for years it practically
destroyed the country tens of thousands
of people were killed you become of the
situations not as much worse but awhile
ago alive it's not a comfortable City
waste gets comparable though it's much
worse now the question is do you believe
that Nicaragua here is an ongoing armed
attack the Nicaragua have the right to
set up on
Washington University it doesn't matter
whether I know it doesn't matter whether
I think it look if your honor your view
well I think it was efficient number of
peopie did it gets women oh right yeah
nobody thought it was right for
Nicaragua set up on some Washington nor
did I the reason is we don't accept the
principle that a country that is under
even our countries is under on rape the
ongoing armed attack has the right to
retaliate with violence what we what we
believe is that what people I wish
should have done is go to the
appropriate international authorities in
this case the world court get a judgment
demanding that the ordering of the
United States to terminate the attack
when the United States rejected the
World Court decision go to the Security
Council get a resolution calling on
States to observe international law when
the United States veto that resolution
and go to the street at the General
Assembly and get authorization which
they did when the u.s. blocked that they
finished international was impossible if
you say that being virtually no
discussion of the option of adhering to
the rule of Libya of discuss it endless
misconduct by gender rights groups in
Europe by the media by all men hired by
the Illinois based on a very narrow
tactical issue important one but narrow
initially in mid-september the rhetoric
appeared to indicate that the u.s. was
planning a massive military attack and
there's a huge amount of discussion
about that and great protests from NATO
leader that's leverages it but that's
about a tactical matter that's whether
you carry out a massive attack which is
going to sort about it was right - no -
no so that was it was discussion in
Europe and it was not the procession in
Europe there was there was very little
discussion as to mean it was full of
discussion about excuse me the
discussion was not about the following
question shall we go to the spiri
Council
get a resolution explicitly authorizing
an action which will identity
by the criminals were unknown find the
evidence call for their extradition if
their extradition is not granted used
force to to apprehend them there was
almost no discussion about that and you
know that perfectly will I'm puzzled by
what I feel comparisons you said when
IRA bombs were set off in London there
was no call to bomb West Belfast or
Boston why would any country attack
itself
why would business part of part of
disempowered the United Kings to me
because West Belfast was the place where
the bombing was originating out of the
United Kingdom makes the difference the
public actually what I said to be clear
is there was no call to bomb Boston and
West Belfast
the reason is Boston is the main source
of the funding that's not in doubt and
West Belfast is presumably the place
where the plans were made for it dary or
you know picks your example where the
Bombers that presumably came from but
you expected this was September 11th
with an external attack the difference
is that the attack on London forces were
coming from inside by night if you don't
like the case of West Belfast let's pick
the other case I mentioned Boston there
was no call to bomb Boston all that's a
source of the financing Peugeot calls a
bomb a lot of places which have been
provided finances there's no call to
bomb Saudi Arabia is that if we accept
that Saudi Arabia provided financing to
al-qaeda in
