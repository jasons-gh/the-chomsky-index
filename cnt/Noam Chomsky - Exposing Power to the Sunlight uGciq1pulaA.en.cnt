I think we should take a lesson from the
the powerful and the rich that they
understand this perfectly well that's
why the population has to be kept in the
dark
actually the professor of the science of
government I love that term at Harvard
leading policy intellectual Samuel
Huntington once pointed out that power
must remain in the dark exposed to the
sunlight it begins to evaporate and he's
right though that's what lies behind the
kind of things I was talking about you
know much more about it here
so one thing you can do is to shun
exposed power to the sunlight and it
will evaporate that's why it's the
massive secrecy has to be maintained but
that's not enough exposing power to the
sunlight has to be a preliminary to the
only thing that has ever worked in
history mass popular organization and
that has achieved results it has a
plenty of results I mean right now the
troika is trying to dismantle and
destroy the Europe's great post-war
achievement the Social Democratic
welfare stated and they're pretty frank
about it
Mario Draghi the of the central bank
just said a couple of years ago that the
social of the social contract is dead it
can't be maintained why not for economic
reasons just because they have the power
to dismantle and destroy it well it
doesn't have to happen the power is
actually in the hands of people like you
but it's got to be exercised and that
requires organization and action as an
individual you can do very little but
when you get together you can do almost
anything and that's been demonstrated
over and over again through history I
mean you mentioned occupy which
is interesting and important I mean I
think if I had been asked myself say
should people occupied Zuccotti Park in
New York my judgment would have been
it's it's pointless I was completely
wrong it was very successful remarkably
successful within days weeks there were
hundreds of Occupy movements around the
country others in Europe I actually
spoke at an Occupy event in Sydney
Australia they were all over the place
it lit a spark which had a real impact
and it changed a lot of things changed
the discourse put inequality on the
agenda for the first time and now
phrases like you know one percent
ninety-nine percent just a common coin
and it's it's but remember that occupy
was a tactic tactics it wasn't a
movement it's a tactic that has every
tactic has diminishing returns can't
keep doing it over and over and this one
in particular couldn't be continued you
cannot occupy a central square say in
New York or Boston over the winter it's
just impossible you're sitting under
five feet of snow you know but and the
population won't accept it after a time
so it has to turn into a movement and to
some extent it has but I think that's
the answer to your question there's no
magic tricks
that's the one that's worked all through
history it's made real achievements if
there's always regression power systems
don't say thank you we're going to give
you the power they try to maintain
themselves and that's the story that's
class struggle goes on through history
and it will continue
you
