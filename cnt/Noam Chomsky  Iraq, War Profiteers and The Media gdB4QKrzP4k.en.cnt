from Pacifica Radio this is democracy
now even the mainstream US press was
compelled to report that the world now
regards George Bush as a greater threat
to peace than Saddam Hussein and that
fact is an understatement
because much as Saddam Hussein was hated
and reviled he was not regarded as a
threat even by the countries that he hit
attacked today
scholar author linguist political
activist Noam Chomsky all that and more
coming up welcome to Democracy Now the
war and peace report I am Amy Goodman
today we'll spend the hour with Noam
Chomsky Institute professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology he
was in New York recently to honor the
late Columbia University professor
Edwards Saeed who died this fall after a
battle with leukemia for over a decade
they had spent time several years ago at
the very theater that Noam Chomsky spoke
at delivering address together on the
Middle East this speech was dedicated to
Professor Edward Saeed in a speech
Chomsky strongly criticized the Bush
administration's war against Iraq and
talked about the power investors have
over world affairs the media's
capitulation to them and much more Noam
Chomsky's latest book is called hegemony
or survival America's quest for global
dominance before that he wrote the
best-selling book nine-one-one this is
Noam Chomsky at Columbia University
first remark has to do with the title
the title that was announced was after
the
or which is a good topic we should be
concerned with what's coming ahead but
any title like that especially in the
United States requires a kind of a word
of caution there is a trap which is
deeply rooted in the intellectual
culture and we have to avoid it the trap
is a doctrine that sometimes called the
doctrine of change of course it's a
doctrine that's invoked every two or
three years in the United States the
content of the doctrine is yes in the
past we did some wrong things because of
our innocence or out of inadvertent but
now that's all over so we can let's not
waste any more time on this boring stale
stuff which incidentally we suppressed
and denied while it was happening but
must now be effaced from history as we
march forward to a glorious future and
if you look it is literally every two or
three years that the doctrine is invoked
there is a qualification we are
permitted in fact required to recall
with great horror the misdeeds of
official enemies and we're also required
to admire with awe our own magnificent
achievements in the past
in both categories relying in no small
measure on self-serving reconstructions
which quickly collapse if you follow the
path of paying attention to the facts
but fortunately that dangerous course is
excluded by the convenient doctrine of
change of course which blocks any such
heresies the doctrine is in
fairly understandable on the part of
those who are engaged in criminal
enterprises which means just about any
power system any system of concentrated
power past and present and of course it
includes its acolytes one of the major
commitments of respected intellectuals
or right throughout history is to be the
acolytes of systems of power since
intellectuals write history that look
like that but you have to be cautious
about what people write about themselves
if you look carefully you'll find that
the course the doctrine is dishonest
cowardly but has it manages it does
protect us from the danger of
understanding what's happening before
our eyes and therefore inducing the kind
of conformism that is useful to systems
of power and domination so it has its
advantages in any event the word after
in the title is appropriate but with
some qualifications that should be what
kept in mind and what has happened
before if we escape the domination of
the doctrine what has happened before
can be expected to persist for
elementary reasons policies and actions
are rooted in institutions there's some
variation but limited the institutions
are stable therefore it's only
reasonable to expect the policies and
actions to persist adapted to
circumstances and if you want to
understand anything about the world that
is to come and have any influence on the
way it evolves more than useful to keep
this in mind well let's go to after the
war we might as well adopting the
doctrine of change of course we might as
well start with today
so today our leader is in London the
Mayor of London greeted him by declaring
that George Bush is the greatest threat
to life on the planet that we have most
probably ever seen as I walked in I was
told by someone that they just heard
over the radio that someone else I
forget who announced that he's the most
unwelcome visitor to England since
William the conquerer
he said these sentiments are described
here as rather somehow with met with
some surprise but that reflects again
the useful category of the useful
quality of forgetting the recent past
similar sentiments have been very widely
expressed since September 2000 to some
extent before but particularly since
then within weeks after September 2002 a
crucial moment in world affairs within
weeks even the mainstream US press was
compelled to report that the world now
regards George Bush as a greater threat
to peace than saddam hussein and that
fact is an understatement because much
as saddam hussein was hated and reviled
he was not regarded as a threat even by
the countries that he had attacked Iran
and quate both of which understood
perfectly well that after a decade of
sanctions that had devastated the
society and after having been
effectively disarmed however awful
Saddam Hussein was he wasn't going to
threaten anybody it was in fact the
weakest country in the region one of the
reasons why it was attacked it met the
primary condition for a target of attack
namely totally defenseless and known to
be in fact they had been they had joined
the other states in the region and
trying to integrate Iraq back into the
great every tenant for several years
over a strong US objection
so the statement well correct is
understated the the these kinds of
reactions those you hear today and
you've been hearing for the past year
pay attention are as far as I'm aware
entirely without precedent I can't
remember anything like them and no
matter how one decides to evaluate the
sentiments that are expressed one thing
is clear no sane person should ignore
them that's a couple of weeks ago there
was a European Union poll which aroused
some interest here the poll was asking
Europeans what they thought the group
was the greatest threat to world peace
and it turned out that the United States
was ranked right next to North Korea and
Iraq same percentage
well that was felt to be a surprise but
it shouldn't have been a surprise
because that's what polls have been
showing for a year over a year growing
concern and fear that the United States
is out of control under the present
leadership and is a tremendous threat to
peace actually the poll the commentary
on the poll focused on something else
namely the u.s. North Korea and Iran
were ranked right below Israel which was
ranked as the greatest threat to peace
but my strong suspicion is that that's
because the questions in the poll were
wrongly asked have to be really careful
reading polls Israel in itself is not a
threat much of a threat at all but u.s.
support for Israel is an enormous threat
to world peace and I presume that that's
what people were answering however the
question was phrased and if that's
correct then the major threats perceived
world peace in Europe are us support for
Israel and which is the regional
superpower and the u.s. actions
elsewhere in the world well if that's
the right and
reputation then the polls are reflecting
an understanding of phenomena that are
real and important and widely understood
they were just pointed out in a
important book that's about to appear by
Dilip hero
it's one of the most astute and
knowledgeable commentator historians
dealing with the contemporary Middle
East and the International framework in
which its problems arise what he says is
about after the war he's at the books
about a written the Iraq war and its
consequences he says what has actually
happened in Iraq is something deadlier
than the worst scenarios sketched by the
so-called liberal pessimists the
invasion of Iraq has led to an alliance
of Arab nationalism with Islamic
militancy steering both of them towards
an amalgam which is very ominous for the
region and in fact for the world again
today's newspapers give you other
examples of that that's and another
contributing factor to this extremely
dangerous amalgam is US support for
Israel's continued rejection of a
long-standing international consensus on
a political settlement for the Israel
Palestine issue and its ongoing actions
to undermine any possibility that a
political settlement can be reached
always crucially with decisive US
support
otherwise those actions are impossible
for 30 years now the US has been
unilaterally and that's worth stressing
unilaterally blocking the possibility of
a political settlement and providing the
decisive diplomatic economic and
military means that permit the actions
that step-by-step make any such
settlement
impossible that's dramatically true
right now it's all consistently
depressed suppressed in the doctrinal
system and now of course it's to be if
even mentioned eliminated from history
by the usual means the convenient
doctrine of change of course well this
is been decisive for thirty years and
it's going on and we should pay
attention to it if we care about the
future today's news again gives further
reasons with regard to Iraq the
predictions before the war by
intelligence agencies and independent
analysts were pretty uniform it was
predicted that the invasion of Iraq
would increase the threat of Terror
would yield the amalgam that Philip euro
is talking about it would increase the
threat of terror and of proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction the logic of
that is straightforward if you announce
to people I'm going to come and attack
you at will without any pretext they
don't say thank you here's my neck cut
it what they do is respond in some
fashion and no one can respond to the
United States in military force the u.s.
spends about as much by now as the rest
of the world combined and is far more
technologically advanced so people turn
to the weapons available to them and the
weak to have weapons available to them
to in fact
terror and weapons of mass destruction
which are now not that hard to construct
and sooner or later will be United for
example they might be united in a small
nuclear weapon sneaked into New York
hotel room not at all out of the
question
and by inciting terror and inciting
proliferation as a deterrent or for
revenge
those probabilities are being increased
well those were the predictions before
the Iraq war and they've been verified
not surprisingly since the war it has
apparently according to specialists on
the various countries involved
stimulated proliferation not
surprisingly and it has certainly
stimulated terror the same intelligence
agencies and independent analysts are
reporting a sharp spike in recruitment
for al-qaeda style organizations and pay
attention you observe an increase of
horrendous terrorist acts all over the
world exactly as predicted well the the
administration was certainly aware of
this I mean they can figure it out
themselves even without reading the
reports of their own intelligence
agencies and they don't desire that
outcome but they don't care that much
it just has a low priority ranked
alongside of other concerns and those
other concerns are not insignificant
some of them are domestic they have a
these are not conservatives they are
radical reactionary status who are
dedicated to unraveling the progressive
achievements legislation and actions of
the past century and to do that they
have a very narrow hold on political
power they must maintain it in order to
carry out that program you see it day by
day and the legislation is produced and
the actions undertaken and they have an
international program which has been
announced dominating the world by force
permanently preventing any challenge and
in particular controlling the very
crucial energy resources of the world
mostly in the Middle East secondarily in
Central Asia and a few other places
those are serious goals and they're
worth undertaking from the perspective
of the policy managers even if it does
increase the threat of
destruction in fact maybe destruction of
the species proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction terror which of which
the population of the United States will
also be subject sooner or later as
before Noam Chomsky speaking at Columbia
University will come back to the speech
and if you'd like to get a copy of it
video or audio you can call one eight
hundred eight eight one two three five
nine one eight hundred eight eight one
two three five nine back with Noam
Chomsky in a minute Jacob's Ladder
Chumbawamba here on democracy now the
war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman as
we return to the speech of Professor
Noam Chomsky how do Iraqis feel about
all this well you know that's obviously
critically important and much harder to
determine it's harder to determine the
attitudes and opinions of people who are
under military occupation but it's not
impossible there's a series of us run
polls taking place and they're
informative so one recent poll actually
had a front-page story in the New York
Times with a headline saying that the
Iraqis are pleased to be rid of Saddam
Hussein well in need a poll to tell us
that and presumably although the
question wasn't asked they're happy to
be relieved of the murderous US
sanctions which had killed hundreds of
thousands of people devastated the
Society and reduced it the total ruin
that question wasn't asked because
you're not allowed to mention it you're
not allowed to mention that this took
place we don't consider our own massive
crimes they're the doctrine of change of
course is so extreme that you don't even
mention them while they're going on let
alone in the past so that question
wasn't asked and what that almost
predictable answer wasn't mentioned also
unmentioned is the fact that the
murderous sanctions are a large part of
the reason why Iraqis were unable to
send Saddam Hussein to the same fate
that greeted
comparable monsters and tyrants and
torturers who were also supported by the
people who are now in office in
Washington just as they supported Saddam
Hussein right through his worst
atrocities and long after the war with
Iran and there's quite a rogue's gallery
Ceausescu of Romania for example was
quite comparable to satnaam supported by
the Reagan and Bush administration's
right to the last minute overthrown from
within and the same is true of a long
list Marcos debate a Mobutu Suharto long
list all strongly supported as long as
they could maintain power overthrown
from within ranking easily many of them
with Saddam Hussein and brutality and
terror but if you destroy a society and
you compel the society to rely on the
tyrant just for survival things like
that aren't going to happen this has
been understood for a long time and
again those are some of the things just
don't mention just like you don't
mention the effects of the sanctions
well there was more interesting aspect
of the poll than the headline if you
read down further in the column there
were other results given one of the
questions asked in the same poll was
people were asked for their how they
evaluated foreign leaders of
favorability ranking do you have a
favorable opinion of you know X Y & Z
well the one who ranked highest was by
far was French president Jacques Chirac
who was the symbol the international
symbol of opposition to the invasion
well below him you found Bush and even
below him the rather pathetic Blair
trailing behind that was reported
without comment although evidently the
New York Times reporter had some
bothered I'm a little and he came back
to it a couple of weeks later and
mentioned it in another context and had
a comment on it
he gave the figures and his comment was
go figure
well you know I'm not sure how exactly
how to interpret that but I presume what
he meant is crazy
arabs you know go figure here we
liberate them and they're not thanking
us for liberating what can you know go
figure what can it possibly mean if they
supported that if they regard Jacques
Chirac as the most with give him the
most highest favorable ranking of any
foreign leader well you know figure
Columbia students might be able to
figure out a different interpretation
but anyway for the times it was go
figure the turn to another poll where
this question was asked reason one how
do you regard the coalition forces are
they an occupying force or a liberating
force by five to one they were called a
occupying force should the coalition
forces leave by five to three
Iraqis one of them to leave that's a
remarkable figure because about 95% of
the population also reports that the
security situation is much worse than it
was before the invasion and the only
thing that's keeping any kind of a lid
on it is the occupying forces but
nevertheless by a very substantial
majority they want to elite one of the
leaf well what does that mean again you
can figure it out other polls are asked
people why did the United States invade
Iraq well here it's worth they're in the
United States there's some answers
straight answers so the official reason
widely repeated as long as you could
hang on to it was that we invaded Iraq
because of their weapons of mass
destruction and their links to terror
which is just such a threat to us that
we can't let it continue and there was a
massive government media propaganda
campaign about this starting in
September 2002 when the invasion was
effectively announced and it did drive a
large part of the US population
completely off the international
spectrum the United States was the only
country
we're a large part of the population was
genuinely afraid of Saddam Hussein
because of his weapons of mass
destruction and his links to terror and
it turns out that the people who had
those attitudes those attitudes are
strongly correlated with support for the
war which is not in the least surprising
and if I believe those things I support
the work - I mean if you believe that
here's a murderous tyrant accumulating
weapons of mass destruction responsible
for 9/11 linked to al-qaeda planning new
terror we gotta stop him in time as a
rational decision to invade Iraq and the
of course there's not the it was never
there never was any reason to believe
that there was particle of truth to that
as I say the US was alone in having any
detectable part of the population hold
those opinions even in places like Iran
and quate well the the lying about that
continues until the present doesn't
matter that it was all debunked so
George Bush and his radio addresses just
a couple of weeks ago he continues to
repeat that the u.s. I'm quoting him
saved the world from a tyrant who was
developing weapons of mass destruction
and cultivating ties to terror well I
know nobody believes that including his
speech writers but they know it but they
know something else they know that if
you keep repeating a lie long and loud
enough and get nobody takes you account
for it it'll become truth there are
plenty of precedents for that not pretty
ones to think about but they're there
and you know them so I won't go on with
them but it helps account for the
reactions that you hear around the world
the collapse of the official stories
about weapons of mass destruction and
terror they did have consequences in
fact ominous consequences
the most significant consequence of the
collapse of the story about weapons of
mass destruction was that it changed the
official doctrine
all of this is taking place in the
context of the national security
strategy that was announced in September
2002 and that strategy was based on the
principle that if a country has weapons
of mass destruction the United States is
entitled to attack it in anticipatory
self-defense what's called in the press
and some commentary pre-emptive war but
that's a total fabrication as nothing to
with pre-emptive war it's just
euphemistic resham as Arthur Schlesinger
pointed out preemption means something
and nothing like that but that was the
doctrine whatever you think about it the
doctrine has been changed with the
discovery that there were no weapons of
mass destruction the doctrine has been
changed so that now the United States
has the right and authority sovereign
right to attack any country that has the
intent and ability to develop weapons of
mass destruction okay that's a
significant change that lowers the bars
on aggression very significantly in fact
it makes it universe every country has
the ability to develop weapons of mass
destruction of any country with a high
school chemistry and biology lab has
that capacity and intent is in the eye
of the beholder
you know you don't you know evidence for
it so that what that's saying in effect
is everybody's liable to attack we have
the sovereign right to attack anyone we
want that's a significant change in the
doctrine and even if it's not reported
here it's noticed by the potential
victims and the potential victims are
now generalized essentially universally
another consequence of the collapse of
the official reasons is that there's a
new you know there's a new doctrine
about why we went to war it was a
reflection of what the press calls are
yearning for democracy said term became
prominent in the Reagan years we have a
yearning for democracy
and it's so we invaded Iraq in order to
establish a democracy there because our
yearning for democracy and in fact did
democratize the whole Middle East and so
on
if you read the commentary on this you
know the press journals and so on I
think you'll discover that this
assumption is close to universal even
the critics the strongest critics say
yes invaded to create democracy but you
know premature can't do it
circumstances aren't right in one
criticism for another and sometimes the
repetition of this assumption reached
the reaches the level of really
rapturous acclaim the kind you may
remember from reading the North Korean
press if you look at it David Ignatius
the highly respected leading commentator
in The Washington Globe recently just
couple weeks ago described the invasion
of Iraq as the most idealistic war
fought in modern times fought solely to
bring democracy to Iraq and the region
and you know how can you be more noble
than that he was particularly impressed
with Paul Wolfowitz the grand visionary
of the yearning for democracy who he
describes as a genuine intellectual
whose heart bleeds for the oppressed in
Muslim in the Muslim world and who
dreams of liberating it so presumably
that explains his career like his very
strong support for Suharto and Indonesia
one of the worst mass murderers and
killers and aggressors and torturers
Wolfowitz was ambassador Dinh de Nieva
you know very full support for his
friend Suharto and that goes right up
till 1997 a couple of months before
Soeharto was overthrown by an internal
revolution I however it's only fair to
say that Wolfowitz is support for
democracy
and yearning you know his heart bleeding
for the tortured victims is ecumenical
it's not limited to Muslims so he had
the same attitude toward he was the high
official in the State Department under
Reagan concerned with Asian affairs and
that support extended to the brutal
vicious dictator Chun of South Korea who
despite the support of the Reagan
administration to the very end was
overthrown by a mass popular movement in
1987 it extends to Marco's and the
Philippines the Reagan administration
was full of what they called love for
Marcos and his love of democracy and
that continued until he was overthrown
to the end all of this is on Wolfowitz
is watch and it continues and won't go
on with it but all of this is irrelevant
because of the convenient doctrine of
change of course so yes he's a grand
visionary who loves democracy and his
heart bleeds for the victims of
oppression and if there's a record that
shows precisely the opposite it's just
that boring old stuff which we forget
about because that's now we're going on
to the future well I don't know how far
back the doctrine of change of course
extends but if it extends a few months
then there's some other things that you
might mention so for example Wolfowitz
dramatically Illustrated his love of
democracy earlier this year when he
berated the Turkish military for failing
to intervene to prevent the elected
government from keeping to the position
of 95 percent of the population okay
Turkish pop 95 % of the population was
opposed to participation in the US war
in Iraq and surprisingly the elected
government went along with him which
caused absolute fury in the United
States and Powell instantly announced
that they were going to be harshly
punished for this
cutting back aid and so on that they
were denounced all over the press
former ambassador Morton Abramowitz
wrote an article saying this proves that
the government lacks democratic
credentials because it's not listening
the orders from Crawford watch Crawford
and Washington it's following 95% of the
population but Wolfowitz went even
beyond denouncing the military for not
intervening and demanding that they
apologize to the United States for this
and recognize that their duty is as he
put it to help the United States now
that's real commitment to democracy and
that's a couple months ago in
extenuation of Wolfowitz one might say
that this was in the midst of a display
of hatred and contempt for democracy of
a sort that I've never seen in the past
it was so obvious you couldn't ignore it
all connected with the same insistence
of a few governments on keeping to the
overwhelming position of their
population bitterly condemned for this
across the spectrum the ones that were
hailed were the ones that disregarded
even larger percentages of their
population they were the bold new Europe
wave of the future it's great
Churchillian figures like Berlusconi for
example I think the I've never seen
anything like that and what's
astonishing and revealing to us and
important for the future is that this
display of total hatred for democracy
went side by side with a chorus of self
adulation for our yearning about our
yearning for democracy I mean to be able
to carry that off is a very impressive
achievement not only of the media but of
educated intellectuals generally I think
we hard to mimic that in a totalitarian
state you might want to think about it
and what it means MIT professor Noam
Chomsky speaking at Miller theater at
Columbia University in November we're
going to come back to the speech if you
want to get a copy
of it you can call 1 888 1 2 3 5 9 if
you'd like to get a videotape of this
speech 1 888 1 2 3 5 9 back with Noam
Chomsky in a minute bomb the world
michael franti here on democracy now as
we return to Noam Chomsky professor of
linguistics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology speaking at
Columbia University this past November
well going back to why did the United
States invade Iraq the story here
changing story but always a story and
Iraqis have some opinions about it too a
few days after the Washington Post
article with the ode to our awesome
magnificence a few days later they
actually published a poll in which
Iraqis were asked among other things why
did the United States invade Iraq and
there were some that agreed that the
u.s. invaded Iraq to establish democracy
at 1%
so Wolfowitz of the American
intellectual community are not totally
without support in Iraq I think about 4%
if I remember thought it was to help
Iraqis then come the obvious reasons
which go figure type reasons well again
that must be the crazy a Rabb's
they don't understand us they're kind of
like the Europeans as other
distinguished commentators have pointed
out for 200 years
Europe has failed to understand what
makes the United States tick they think
we're have crafts motives and so on they
don't know that we're driven by
indescribable idealism it's max boot
Robert Kagan and others who are
apparently unaware that they're simply
plagiarizing the most disgraceful
episodes of European imperialism where
every horrendous act in England and
France and Germany and everywhere else
was accompanied by exactly the same
rhetoric I mean almost to the word
sometimes
anyhow they don't understand it the
Iraqis maybe their failure to comprehend
what we're doing
I felt us from there the fact that they
haven't yet mastered the doctrine of
change of course so they don't know that
they somehow think that everything we've
done in the past might have some bearing
on what's happening now and maybe
they're even aware that what's held here
there there's something here you read
about called the the Neo Reaganite the
pursuing the hopes that Bush will pursue
the what's called the Neo Reaganite
course of democracy enhancement that was
the leading theme of the Reagan
administration yearning for democracy
and democracy enhancement and something
did happen and in fact if you look at
the polls I just quoted you see a
sophisticated comprehension of it so 1%
of the Iraqi population says the u.s.
invaded to establish democracy but about
half the population says the u.s. will
establish a democratic form of
government okay and they add the US will
maintain pressure and influence on that
democratic form of government and that's
correct the United States like every
other conquering power I mean even
Stalin wants to establish something that
we call the democratic form of
government but we'll make sure that it
operates within fixed limits so Stalin
was full of the most impressive rhetoric
about the need for democracy even
established people's democracies you
know had votes all sorts of things and
that's conventional and in fact the more
you know honest scholars and the even
participants in the so-called democracy
enhancement programs recognize that the
u.s. was willing to establish democracy
or at least tolerated but only on
quoting top down forms of democracy in
which traditional elite link
to the United States retain power
whatever the Democratic forms actually
that holds internally to the United
States as well but that's that
conception of democracy is not a
permitted but in fact prefer if only for
public relations reason reasons and
evidently Iraqis have some insight into
this fact judging by poll figures like
this assuming that they're not just
crazy Arabs and you can't explain
anything but if you try to give an
explanation doesn't seem hard to give
one and it is after all their own
experience I mean the British in there
who created Iraq for their own interests
when they ran that part of the world
they did pretty much the same thing and
go back to the British colonial office
records in the First World War
they discussed how they should set up in
the region that they're running what
they called Arab facade that is weak
pliable governments if they can look
democratic that's fine
as long as the British effectively rule
behind one or another constitutional
fiction like formal democracy as long as
that can be done then the Arab facades
are fine collaborators should run the
government both the political and the
military side and that's incidentally
the way empires usually run they run
with collaborators so like when then
even the worst killers and tyrants say
the Nazis in occupied Europe they didn't
administer the countries France was
administered by the French the security
forces were French a same throughout the
region Stalin the Russians in Eastern
Europe rarely had to intervene the
countries were controlled by domestic
collaborators government security forces
and so on and that's typical of the
history of empire in fact what's amazing
about the Iraqi occupation surprises me
at least is that the occupiers have been
so incompetent
and arrogant and ignorant that they
haven't been able to carry off what
should have been one of the easiest
military occupations in history and
certainly has been carried out by plenty
of others characteristically military
occupations succeed under much more
difficult conditions here there's no
externals it's not like Nazi Germany you
know where there was external support
for resistance and the country was under
attack you know attack you know no
external support for resistance they did
end the sanctions you know tremendous
benefit they got rid of a tyrant how can
you fail you know somehow it's failing
that's interesting to see why when the
words I just used arrogance incompetence
and ignorance are in fact the words of a
high official of one of the major NGOs
who's had experience I can't mention his
name who's had experience all over the
most worst parts of the world and said
he after a couple months in Baghdad that
he'd never seen anything like well
anyway that's where it is the Bush
administration has announced new plans
last couple of days that are supposed to
relieve this unimaginable failure and
they've been very highly praised you
look at the plans incidentally among
I'll come back to that a second but
among the plans they've already
implemented are as you know imposing an
extremely harsh neoliberal economic
program which effectively hands the
entire economy over to foreign investors
and banks and local collaborators it's
certain that no sovereign country would
ever accept such a such a regime and it
has been pointed out you know you're
starting to get commentary in law
journals and a few other places that
this is all totally illegal it's in
radical violation of the Geneva
Conventions on occupy
datian and furthermore that they've been
pointed out that any independent Iraqi
government is very likely to just
renounce all of these agreements because
they are imposed by force illegally they
have no status and that would leave the
US taxpayer with a huge bill to pay for
all the actions that when they're taken
under the rubric of this these illegal
measures
well those critical comments are making
an assumption that the u.s. is someday
going to permit an independent Iraqi
government to exist and where's that
assumption come from can you find a
basis for that in the history of the
control of the backyard
you know Caribbean Central America for a
century or anywhere else for that matter
I think you have a hard time finding it
but if you adopt the doctrine of change
of course you don't have to worry about
ugly little questions like that when the
new plans were announced a few days ago
as I said highly praised and there's a
small aspect of them which received less
attention one is that they include a
Status of Forces Agreement of a familiar
kind which guarantees the right of the
US military to remain without change in
Iraq under its own decisions and to
establish military bases which are to be
permanent military bases on the analogy
in this is described as of Afghanistan
and Kosovo so the countries can go to
wreck and ruin nobody cares about that
but the u.s. retains the military bases
in Iraq it's particularly important not
like much more so than Afghanistan and
Kosovo although those are related
because having a major military base at
the heart of the oil-producing regions
is a very significant achievement the US
has not the whole US military basing
system for years around the world has
been oriented toward the Middle East the
main energy producing region but the US
hasn't had any stable basis there
up until a couple of years ago the
nearest one was in the British island of
Diego Garcia and the Indian Ocean from
which the inhabitants were expelled and
the British courts ordered the
government to allow them to return but
then there's that thing called the
special relationship that people talk
about under the special relationship if
the British courts order the government
to allow the inhabitants to return and
the partner says get lost they get lost
so the basis remain and the inhabitants
don't return one small aspect of the
special relationship many others like it
and the but now they're the bases are
coming closer
so Afghanistan is close by Kosovo is
much closer to the oil-producing regions
and earlier ones the bases in Central
Asia where the u.s. is now supporting
another rogues gallery comparable to the
first term of the same people
Karim F and others belong in the same
category they the bases there are again
part of the encircling of the major
Middle East region and also placing US
corporations and interests in a
effective position for their for control
of Central Asian resources which are not
at the level of Middle East but are not
insignificant a base right in the middle
is extremely important and that's very
crucial for world control that has been
understood for years the that's
particularly important to control the
Middle East oil reserves roughly
expected to be about two-thirds of
energy reserves in the coming years
because that provides what George Kennan
once called veto power over the actions
of others in the world and the others in
the world who are of most concern are
the other major economic centres
in what has been a tri-polar an economic
world for a quarter of a century Europe
and Northeast Asia which is the most
dynamic economic region of the world
they there has always been a concern
with Europe it goes back half a century
that they might move on an independent
course and that's a deep concern of US
policymakers control of base the control
of energy and also of sea lane is one
way to forestall forestall such efforts
not insignificant well it's important to
bear in mind finally that the
astonishing
reaction global reaction and domestic
reaction to the Bush administration's
actions and plans it's not just a matter
of the invasion of Iraq and it's maybe
the dramatic one but that's against the
background if the invasion had taken
place without the background you
wouldn't get this reaction it's widely
understood that the invasion of Iraq was
what sometimes called an exemplary
action that is an action undertaken to
demonstrate to the world that the
administration was very serious about
the doctrine that had just been
announced invasion of Iraq was announced
about the same time as the national
security strategy and the doctrine did
declare that the u.s. has the right of
aggression at will without pretext
without international authorization was
announced right brazenly it's not
entirely new any means but the
brazenness of the proclamation and the
instant implementation made it clear
that this is a significant turning point
foreign affairs the main establishment
journal immediately a couple of weeks
later had a major article describing
what it called the new imperial grand
strategy of the Bush administration
which it went on to describe in muted
terms as a great danger to the United
States and the world a very widely held
view
and it's this the exemplary action
announced at once the invasion of the
river Iraq was combined with a few
several others which are equally and
maybe even more on ominous right after a
couple of weeks after the national
security strategy was announced and the
invasion was announced the Space Command
yeowch is a charge of militarization of
space announced that it was changing
that print it presented its plans for
the next couple of years and it said
we're shifting the mission from control
of space which was the Clinton doctrine
to ownership of space so we're moving
from control to ownership well that's an
accord with the national security
strategy no potential challenge the u.s.
authority will ever be tolerated and
force will be used to prevent it well
space is new frontier so we're not just
going to control it we're going to own
it no one's going to get near it and
they spell out what that means that
means putting space putting up space
platforms which can be used for
offensive military weapons nuclear and
non-nuclear highly lethal weapons which
can strike anywhere on earth
instantaneously with no warning the
world is to be covered with hypersonic
drones which are going to give instant
information back to some command post
and you know Colorado mountains or
whatever about somebody crossing the
street and Istanbul or whatever they
happen to be looking at in principle
that means that the entire world is at
mercy of the Pentagon instantaneous
attacked with highly destructive weapons
no warning this is backed up by a first
strike policy which again is not new
Clinton had it too but it's a much more
clearly enunciated
this reduces the need for forward bases
which are often a pain in the neck
because people don't like them since you
have a forward base namely the space
space which you own and it puts the
whole it does literally put the whole
world at the mercy of the Pentagon and
the White House there are other
futuristic programs which have also been
announced if you take a look at the
DARPA it's a good place to look you know
the Advanced Research Projects Agency of
the Pentagon are planning some pretty
astonishing things described as
potential military measures but it's
worth remembering that there's something
that the Pentagon knows that doesn't
really seem that penetrate much in the
economics department and that is that
the economy as a whole
relies very heavily on a dynamic state
sector which socializes cost and risk
privatizes profit not only if for a long
time it's been under a military cover
now it's moving to other covers as the
cutting edge of the economy becomes
biology based rather than electronics
based you see a shift in federal funding
reflecting that understanding and the
DARPA programs are in things like anoro
engineering and other areas which are
expected to be part of the cutting edge
of the economy so sooner or later after
the public pays the costs if anything
comes out hand it over to private
corporations that's known as free
enterprise officially all of this
increases the threats to survival which
is not unusual if you take a look at
history including recent history
it's simply replete with illustrations
of how leaders have been willing to face
destruction significant risk of
destruction in order to achieve narrow
interests to advance narrow interests of
power and domination and enrichment in
this case shaping the powerful state to
serve their interests
cut off the parts that serve the
interest of the public there are
differences today for one thing the
administration is at an extreme
reactionary end of a rather narrow
planning spectrum which is the reason
for the enormous reaction and of course
the scale is different the stakes are
much higher than they've been in the
past it's not so clear that there's much
time left to prevent literal destruction
of the species or something rather close
to it there may not be much time left to
reverse this course and we know if we're
honest that we can do it but it's going
to require will and dedication it's not
going to happen by itself Noam Chomsky
