I'm in the period when the press was
most free was about the mid 19th century
I mean at that time just keeping to say
England of the United States the two
cases that have been studied I imagine
it's the same elsewhere in the mid 19th
century there was a very lively popular
press very widely read by you know
working people by everyone but you know
much reached far beyond the commercial
media at the time was very diverse it
represented you know reflected public
interest and public concerns and was
very popular in Britain they tried to
close it down by censorship of various
kinds but that didn't work there were
too many ways to avoid it and it was
finally understood that the way to
eliminate it was by advertising or
reliance on advertising and by
concentration of capital so just through
the effect of reliance on advertising
which was then just a you know kind of
beginning like around a century ago and
concentration of capital they've
realized that over time they could
marginalize the independent popular
press which couldn't get the advertising
of course because advertisers don't like
what they were saying and didn't have
the capital and it took a long time so
in England that was actually up until
that about 40 years ago still the case
40 years ago that the main newspaper in
England The Daily Herald was a kind of
labor oriented social democratic
newspaper very popular you know if
everybody had outsold all the others the
the mirror which was the main tabloid
was the same kind of leftist paper
popular paper but they kind of succumb
to advertising pressure and capital
control the United States happened a bit
earlier but it was the same same process
and the advertising is I mean it's part
of much bigger industry it's as
advertising is part of the public
relations industry there's a huge
industry and it developed very
consciously around the First World War
in the two most democratic countries the
united in land and the united states and
there's a good reason for it they were
coming dunder as the countries were
becoming more free that just through
popular struggle and people were winning
the franchise and you couldn't shut him
up anymore by force it became it was
understood that you're gonna have to
control people by controlling opinion
and attitudes because we can't rely on
fortunate anymore and control of opinion
and attitudes means well you know there
was actually a phrase for it this this
was the time when what was called
scientific management of work was
becoming a big issue taylor right
management you know ford know that stuff
but it was also understood you want to
not only control very closely the lives
of people in their work time but also
you have to control them in their off
work time and what you have to do is
turn them into passive obedient
consumers who don't pay you know don't
try to get out of our hair basically pay
attention to the what we're called the
superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption you get them
trapped into consumerism isolated from
one another atomized control their
beliefs
that's where notions like manufacture of
consent come from right after this first
world war and out of this came huge
industries the advertising is a large
part of it but and it of course affects
the media and normally i mean if any
viewer you know if you watch television
for example takes a television when you
turn on the television set the
corporation doesn't make any money right
like they you don't pay them when you
turn it on less it's cable but they do
so why do they do it well they do it
because of the advertising so the the
resources and the creativity and the
effort and so on in the whole television
industry goes in advertisement in fact
within the television industry they
there are there are words called content
and fill like a program has content and
a program has to fill the content is the
advertisement
the fill is the car chase that's in
there to keep you watching until the
next dad comes along and all the effort
of course goes into the advertiser and
the the country phil has to you know
first let's keep your interest enough
see to watch the advertising but the
advertising is there for a purpose I
mean it's to make you it's to turn
people into creatures whose only concern
in life is to max out their five credit
cards and not to pay attention to what's
going on in the world and let the rich
powerful guys do what they want with
that interference
