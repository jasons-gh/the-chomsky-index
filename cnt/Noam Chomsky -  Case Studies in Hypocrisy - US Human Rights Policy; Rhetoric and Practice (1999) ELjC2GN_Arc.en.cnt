topic was proposed by suggested by the
fact that we're approaching the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights this is these last few
years the years last years of the 1990s
are sort of a season of semi-centennial
anniversaries of the reasons obvious
World War two marked a very significant
turning point in human affairs the
industrial societies were mostly
destroyed the US economy prospered
during the war the u.s. ended the war in
a position of extraordinary power earth
had about half the wealth of the world
and incomparable military power and
security and naturally it used this
power to attempt to organize the world
to construct a new world order which in
fact was really deserved the term it has
it's now half a century we can look back
and ask how its fared the new world
order of the late 40s was based on three
fundamental building blocks one was an
international economic order what's
called the Bretton Woods system a second
was an international political order
of which the foundation is the United
Nations Charter and the third was a set
of international norms for the behavior
of governments toward their populations
that's the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights so what I want to do is
review where these stand what's happened
to them what it suggests for the future
and I'll focus primarily on the
third the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights well threaten the first the
Bretton Woods system is often described
as a system of liberal internationalism
actually I've described it that way but
that's not quite correct ACTA the intent
of the founders of Bretton Woods the
Harry Dexter white the US negotiator and
John Maynard Keynes British negotiator
their intent was partially to create an
international liberal order they
intended to try to liberalize trade but
at the same time to regulate capital
those two principles were related and
they're in fact reflected in the rules
of the IMF the International Monetary
Fund those rules state that the Charter
the IMF states that countries are
entitled to regulate capital and the IMF
is in fact prohibited by its charter
from providing credit what are called
rescue packages these days to cover
capital flight that's prohibited the
reason for the regulation of capital
flow was in part a belief widely held
among economists including Keynes and
white that liberalisation of capital
allowing free flow of capital would
undermine free trade that's a thesis
like most laws of economics it's largely
speculative but plausible and in fact
rather well supported by the experience
of the last 25 years come back to that
but the major reason was something which
wasn't a thesis it was virtual truism
and that is that free movement of
capital undermines democracy and
essentially dismantles the welfare state
which was very popular at an enormous
amount of support among the public and
throughout the world including the
United States so that couldn't be
simply abandoned in fact they wanted to
strengthen it the problem is that free
flow of capital creates what some
international economists call a virtual
Senate meaning financial capital can
impose the social policies that it
chooses on governments and it can punish
those that deviate by capital flight
that naturally restricts democracy it
undermines the possibility for
governments meaning to the extent that
the Democratic people to participate in
socio-economic planning and it also
undermines efforts to use public
resources and what's called
inefficiently that means for people not
for investors so for example efforts to
stimulate the economy or to create full
employment or to use public resources
for health or education or for social
welfare for the environment for improved
working conditions and other irrational
purposes can be terminated and punished
by simply flight of capital which even
these days rich and powerful states
can't withstand that's the main reason
for the insistence in the Bretton Woods
system that capital flight be regulated
and controlled than the prohibition on
the IMF to assign provide credits to
cover capital flight
well those principles the second
principle the prohibition on credits
were capital flight that was never taken
seriously the rescue packages as they're
called for the third world quite
substantially do cover capital flight
the third world debt would be very close
to eliminated in some cases completely
eliminated if the societies were able to
control their own wealthy people meaning
keep the capital at home
keep the wealthy from robbing the
country in the case of Indonesia for
example the current IMF rescue package
approximate is approximately equal to
the estimated wealth of the Suharto
family so there's an easy way to pay off
the debt just go to the people who've
been robbing the country blind with ever
since they took power and a huge
massacre 30 years ago the Latin American
debt
flight capital flight from wealthy Latin
Americans comes pretty close and
sometimes in fact exceeds the
third-world debt the Latin American debt
which was educated pastor fees since
1982 the way things work the money is
borrowed by the wealthy and by dictators
and Generals and so on and then it's
paid by the poor they pay it off and by
Western taxpayers who - when the debt is
socialized but those aren't economic
laws those are social constructions and
they indicate they reflect that the
failure to take seriously this founding
principle of the New World Order
it isn't incidentally just the third
world that began back in the late 1940s
with the reconstruction of Europe there
was money in Europe in the hands of
wealthy Europeans but US planners
preferred to have wealthy Europeans send
their wealth to New York banks with
American taxpayers paying for the
reconstruction of Europe there's
actually a name for that it's called the
Marshall Plan the Marshall Plan if you
look at the figures and this was well
understood at the time the Marshall Plan
funding comes as approximately the same
order and may even have been exceeded by
flight of capital from wealthy Europeans
to New York banks so that's a Z so that
principle was words never been applied
on the other hand the other principle
about constraining capital flow that was
taken quite seriously that was that
prince
or was enforced during what usually
called the Golden Age of the post-war
economic growth high economic growth
high productivity growth expansion of
the social contract of the period of the
1950s and 60s that was a period in which
in fact capital was closely regulated
that system Bretton Woods system was
broken down and dismantled by Richard
Nixon in the early 1970s with the
assistance of Britain later other
countries and it had the pretty much the
predicted effect it was predicted right
away in the early 70s when capital
controls were dismantled that this would
lead to a low a period of low growth low
wages and in fact very high profits
which is pretty much what we've seen
their world that was also an attack on
the welfare state primarily in the
United States and Britain but to an
extent in other rich countries as well
the that's these are major features of
the past 25 years also lower
productivity growth and indeed lower
growth of trade because as the thesis
suggested the reduction of the
elimination of capital controls in
introduced various forms of
protectionism pretty much as predicted
so this has been a period of what's been
called a sustained assault on free trade
and by the head of the economic of a
head of economic research World Trade
Organization in a major technical study
he incidentally estimates Reaganite
barriers to imports at about as having
about three times the effect of other
trade barriers instituted by other rich
countries and in fact the Reagan
administration broke records and market
interference and this and other ways
there is it was it is has been a period
of very high concentration of the some
wealth that has been produced and it's
been very highly concentrated as you all
know inequality has risen very sharply
primarily in the United States and
Britain in the u.s. it's back to the
levels of the 1920s that we're currently
in the midst of something called a fairy
tale economic boom it is a fairy tale
it's the weakest recovery in post-war
history far below the 50s and the 60s
and not even at the level of lead rather
anemic 70s and 80s in fact the US
economic growth in the 1990s is roughly
at the at about at the norm for the rich
countries the OECD countries the
economic boom the fairy tale economic
boom is unique in another respect it's
the first one in American history where
there has been no increase in median
income for about two-thirds of the
population wages and incomes have either
stagnated or even significantly declined
in the last 2025 years and while they're
rising slightly now it's not even back
to the 1989 level but along the 1970s
people are working longer the average
workers working about a month longer
than 25 years ago I working conditions
are much worse there's less pay that is
far less security but there is enormous
wealth very highly concentrated all the
you know owed to the fairy tale economic
boom to quite consistently point to the
stock market as a proof of how great
things are and it is great for the
people who won't stop 1% of the
population owns bat of households owns
about half the stock and most of the
rest is owned by the top 10% if you
bring in pension funds you get a little
shuffling in the top 20% but for most
popular
roughly 3/4 this is just something you
watch something you take part in and you
watch it while you're on condition
stagnated or declined that's the fairy
tale economic it's understood why the
moon was taking place it was explained
in this fashion that was actually
explained by the man who the business
press calls the saintly Alan Greenspan
in his I didn't make it up
the financial times have London the
leading business paper in the world the
saintly Alan testified about the fairy
tale economic boom before Congress about
a year ago and he took great pride in it
head of the Federal Reserve and he
attributed the fairy tale to what he
called greater worker insecurity in
other words workers are too intimidated
to ask for benefits or wages or better
working conditions and that contributes
to something called the health of the
economy that's a technical term that's
uncorrelated with the health of the
population often contrary to it but
greater worker insecurity does
contribute to that the Clinton
administration in the economic report of
the president last year the last one
they also took pride in the great
economic achievements and they basically
gave the same explanation they
attributed them to what they called
significant wage restraint well yeah
that's the result of growing worker
insecurity workers are frightened and
with cause so for example one of the
consequences of NAFTA which was studied
under NAFTA as you recall hadn't it's
basically an investor rights agreement
but it did have some wording thrown in
to make it look as if labor rights and
environmental rights were going to be
considered under that the citing side
side agreement there is a requirement
that complaints of about unfair labor
practices must be investigated and in
the course of one of these
investigations the study was done by a
well known
u.s. labor economist bronfenbrenner of
Cornell University studying the effects
of NAFTA on organizing efforts in the
United States the report was in fact
released by Canada and Mexico was
delayed by the Clinton administration it
she discovered that in fully half of the
organizing effort since NAFTA have been
disrupted by threats to transfer
production to Mexico for example a
trailer can be put up outside a plant
with this sign on it saying makes a code
transfer job or something like that
that's all it legal but the Reagan
administration and now the Clinton
administration have basically informed
the business community that's not going
to apply the laws so it may be illegal
but it happens and those threats are not
idle after NAFTA the if when organizing
efforts nevertheless exceed the rate of
actual transfer is three times the level
prior to NAFTA these are reasons why
workers are intimidated in there plenty
of others so during this period of
dazzling profit growth in the fairy tale
economic boom major corporations have
made plenty of money in fact they don't
know what to do with it some of them do
know what to do with it for example the
caterpillar corporation just won a major
strike big blow the labor in Illinois
one of the techniques that they used was
to make use of excess production
facilities that they had created abroad
not for purposes of economic efficiency
but for class warfare they could use
their excess capacity production
capacity abroad to undermine domestic
workers which they did along with other
measures such as the use of permanent
replacement workers and violation of
international conventions the United
States has been censured for that by the
International Labor Organization but of
course doesn't care these are
contributory factors to work or greater
worker intimidation and they're related
to the
lack of constraints on capital flow in
the third world it ends up with you know
miserable poverty and structural
adjustment programs and so on here it
leads to a fairy tale economic boom
based on growing worker insecurity well
that's the international economic system
in a very quick nutshell what about the
International political system based on
the UN Charter now that one we can go
through very we can be brief the
fundamental principle of the United
Nations Charter is a flat prohibition
against the threat or use of force in
international affairs sole exception is
either self-defense if somebody attacks
you until the Security Council acts or
else when authorized by the Security
Council well we've just been through a
dramatic illustration of how of the
status of this principle namely the Iraq
crisis there was a good deal of
discussion of what measures the United
States should take should do this that
should do the other thing but I couldn't
find any discussion of it at all of the
idea that maybe we should live up to
what is technically the supreme law of
the land under the Constitution namely
the United Nations Charter which bars
the United States from doing anything
except on the specific authorization of
the Security Council that wasn't even an
option so that's not considered in fact
if you read Secretary of State Albright
statements and others President Clinton
and the rest they simply said we will
act as we determine appropriate in
judgment of our so-called national
interests if the if we decide that we
will use force or threaten force
nobody's going to change that because we
regard ourselves as a rogue state which
is free from any international
obligations and certainly the many
conditions imposed by the UN Charter
well that's it the charters words thanks
to the actions of the most powerful
States and there's nothing
about this more than ten years ago back
in 1986 the United States even went so
far as to veto a Security Council
resolution which called on all states to
observe international law mentioning no
one in particular but everyone knew who
they meant it was an oblique reference
to the fact that the World Court had
just determined that the United States
was guilty of what the court called
unlawful use of force polite way of
referring to aggression in its terrorist
war against Nicaragua and of course the
u.s. rejected the judgment of the court
with complete contempt as did the
intellectual opinion but then it went to
the Security Council over the u.s.
vetoed a resolution calling on States to
observe international law and it then
proceeded to veto several general
General Assembly resolutions with the
same you can technically veto the
General Assembly resolution but when the
u.s. votes against it if the vote is
let's say 150 to one as it often is the
resolution is essentially vetoed so this
is old the political international
political system is basically weapons
that you've been used against the weak
well let's turn to a third pillar of the
New World Order the Universal
Declaration the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights is based on the principle
the fundamental principle of it is given
in the phrase universal the provisions
of the Universal Declaration are to have
equal standing that is there are there
is there are no ground for what is
called relativism self-serving
relativism a decision to selectively use
adopt one or another of the provisions
and there certainly are no grounds for
the particularly ugly form of selective
relativism which involves appeal to the
Universal Declaration as a weapon
against enemies no this
the there was a vast amount of
discussion about this just about five
years ago there was a conference at
Vienna in 1993 on the Universal
Declaration there was look back at the
press many of you will remember there
was a deluge of impressive rhetoric
which was praising Washington's courage
in standing up against upholding the
universal universality of the Universal
Declaration against what were called
third-world relativists people who
appeal to Asian values or other
deviations from the sacred principles
well those are good principles maybe
even noble principles and we can ask how
well they've they have fared over the
years concentrating on the most
important case the most powerful state
the self-appointed guardian of global
virtue and defender of the universality
of the Universal Declaration and apart
from those objective factors of the
state that's of course most important
for us for the obvious reason that we
share responsibility for what it does
either by lending support or by tacit
acquiescence well you look at the
Universal Declaration you find that its
provisions fall into two major
categories the first is what are called
civil and political rights the second
what are called socio-economic rights
let's start with the civil and political
rights the UD the Universal Declaration
is not very well known in the United
States so you can ask your friends to
list the resolutions and you probably
won't get very good answers but there is
one article which is very well known the
most famous of all that's article 13
says everyone has the right to leave any
country including his own the reason why
that is very well-known is that every
year on human rights day December 10th
December 10th
the there were huge demonstrations big
advertisements and so on denouncing the
Soviet Union correctly for rejecting
article 13 and not allowing Soviet Jews
to leave
so that's article 13 actually that's
part of article 13 actually what article
13 says is something a little different
and I have never seen the final words
quoted in all of this you know and all
of this massive publicity what article
13 says is everyone has the right to
leave any country including his own and
return to his own country
well those final words are omitted their
meaning was spelled out on December 11th
1948 the day after the acceptance of the
Universal Declaration in UN resolution
194 which was unanimously accepted as
well and which stated that Palestinian
refugees who had fled or been expelled
from their homes had the right of return
or if they chose not to return of
compensation the compensation would have
been no small matter the government of
Israel secretly no released and secret
documents estimated the compensation
costs at that time at about a billion
dollars which would be roughly six
billion today not counting interest far
greater than German reparations
well that's resolution 194 that's
article 13 half of it states that anyone
and specifically Palestinians they were
the ones they were talking about have
the right to return to their own country
well that's the history of this is kind
of interesting
I've thinking through you'll notice that
the most passionate and vocal defenders
of article 13 we're in
were most angrily denouncing the Soviet
Union for rejecting are in fact the
strongest opponents of article 13 they
would never have considered for a moment
permitting article 13 to apply article
13 the the art of resolution 194 calling
for the right of Palestinians to return
that was voted as I mentioned
unanimously and again every year year
after year it was endorsed completely
hypocritically of course no one really
meant it but notice that this is a case
of really extreme relativism we take an
article of the of the Universal
Declaration and decide that the last
five words of it don't exist are the
ones that that apply in a fashion which
the powerful in this case the United
States and its clients do not accept
that's relativism pushed to an extreme
apart from the hypocrisy to the credit
of the Clinton administration they did
end the hypocrisy in 1993 for the first
time the United States voted against
resolution 194 along with Israel that
rescinds the second half of article 13
the first half is now irrelevant with
the Soviet Union gone so there's no more
hypocrisy article 13 has simply removed
from the universal declaration by us
fired as for the refugees the millions
of refugees they have been disappeared
to borrow a term of our Latin American
client and the so-called peace process
offers that name mention them offers
them nothing well that's article 13
relativism triumphant let's move on to
article 14 article 14 says that everyone
has the right to seek and enjoy asylum
from persecution Haitians for example
right in the middle of the Vienna
conference in fact just as it opened 87
more
stations were captured by Clinton's
illegal blockade of the island and
forcibly returned to their torture
chamber there was a terrorist military
regime at the time which was carrying
out brutal murders and assassinations
this event was virtually unmentioned in
the press in the national press
unmentioned in the Boston Globe it did
make page 68 was mentioned in a story on
another topic so that's everyone having
the right to seek and enjoy asylum from
persecution the Clinton administration
of course didn't invent this this policy
of forcibly returning Haitians to terror
and oppression goes back to Jimmy Carter
there was an agreement made between
Carter and the an informal agreement
between Carter and the dictator of Haiti
into VA to return refugees that in
violation of article 14 that agreement
was formalized under the Reagan
administration as a formal arrangement
of illegally blockaded Haiti and forced
the refugees back that was continued
under the Bush administration but it did
change it changed in January of 1991
what had happened was that Haiti had its
first democratic election and everyone's
surprised very lively and vibrant
popular movement based in the hills and
in the slums which nobody had been
paying attention to succeeded in
sweeping its own candidate into office a
populist priest John Bertrand R Steve
that was a very impressive demonstration
of democracy in action the United States
was totally appalled appalled
it had very confidently expected the
victory of its own candidate of a World
Bank former World Bank official who got
14% of the vote the US was instantly
hostile and tried to undermine the
regime it terminated a
it actually maintained aid but it
switched it to opponents of the
government in the business community it
also changed the refugee policy up until
that time refugees had been forcibly
returned after the Democratic regime was
established refugee flow slowed to a
trickle in fact it actually reversed
because people returning to the country
in a moment of hope but the u.s. at that
point began to accept asylum claims in
fact that 50 times the previous rate
during the democratic interlude
well things returned to normal seven
months later when there was a military
coup that instituted huge terror with
tacit support of the Bush and Clinton
administration's but it did also change
refugee policy moving it back into
direct violation of article fourteen
with another blockade forcing people
back to terror
well that's article 14 it's not the only
example but maybe the most dramatically
let's move on to article 19 article 19
says that everyone has the freedom to
seek receive and impart information and
ideas through any medium well there's no
law that bars that in the United States
but the institutional structures very
clearly
do do prevent it and quite radically so
there's no law that bars me from saying
now correctly that the United States has
been one of the leading opponents maybe
the leading opponent given its strength
of the three major pillars of the
post-war order the Bretton Woods system
the UN Charter and the Universal
Declaration there's no law that prevents
me from saying that the United States
attacked South Vietnam under the kennedy
administration in 1961 and extended the
war to all of Indochina or there's no
word a law that prevents me from doing
what I just did waiting out the World
Court condemned the US for unlawful use
of force in Nicaragua and that the u.s.
was carrying a
major terrorist war in the region in
large part of war against the church
there's nothing that prevents saying all
these things but they're not part of to
say that people have access to relevant
information about that would be a joke
they certainly don't either in the media
or the schools or the universities or
the journals of opinion or for that
matter in most of academic scholarship
that's institutional structure it's not
laws which in effect undermine article
19 I mean just take one example which is
current and rather dramatic and
potentially if quite great significance
that's the has to do with the
multilateral agreement on investment the
M AI you recall that last fall there was
huge
hubbub about the fast track there's a
lot to say about that but I put it aside
but one element of the fast track
discussion was that almost certainly the
MA I was a major factor entering into it
in fact even before the fast-track
legislation had been introduced the US
Council for International Business had
demanded have requested I suppose is the
word of the Clinton administration that
they include the MA I as a central
element and fast track and surely that
was true that's a lot more important
than bringing Chile at the NAFTA or the
kinds of things that we talked about all
of that was known all of this has been
known but suppressed
can't find anything about it in the
discussion why is that the case the
corporate world was enthusiastic but it
understood perfectly well that the
public was opposed it was not quoted
through which is quite a victory for
grassroots activism the reason was
explained by the wall street journal
during this period it said that although
there's they regarded in fest tractus
what they called a no-brainer so obvious
that we
should have it that he can't even
discuss it they said that critics have
what they called an ultimate weapon
namely the public is opposed and it's
difficult to deal with that the public
is what Alexander Hamilton once called
the Great Beast and when the Great Beast
gets out of its cage get into all kinds
of trouble why should the public have
been opposed to fast-track incidentally
well there was very little discussion of
what it was all about but people were
instinctively opposed and for good
instincts contrary to what was being
discussed
FastTrack didn't do with free trade for
one thing because the agreements they
had in mind aren't really free trade
agreements but for another because the
issue was not trade at all the issue was
democracy the fast-track legislation can
allows the President to negotiate trade
agreements without any public knowledge
or any public or for that matter of
congressional participation Congress has
simply offered the option you know say
yes or no which means you say yes the
most ardent advocate of free trade would
oppose fast-track if they happen to
believe in democracy that if they happen
to believe that the public has a right
to know what's happening to them and
have a voice in shaping policy well all
of that was suppressed the major issue
the ma I was suppressed again all known
but suppressed for good reasons you
don't want the Great Beast to find find
out what's going on and to serve as the
ultimate weapon against what the serious
people intend intend to push through the
Free Press in the United States and the
intellectuals were super disciplined in
violating article 19 there was virtually
nothing about it last November 25
members of Congress sent a letter to the
White House in which they said it
has come to our attention through the
efforts of grassroots activists and
public interest groups they said it has
come to our attention that for almost
three years the White House has been
negotiating a very comprehensive trade
agreement in secret and they asked how
can this be possible given that under
the Constitution international commerce
is has to be is the province of the
Congress not the president and
furthermore the terms of the treaty
which had been leaked
they've been illicitly obtained and
leaked the terms of the agreement
endorsed investor rights corporate
rights that go far beyond the provisions
of US law so how can this be going on
well they get any real response they got
the claim you know sort of it vacuous
letter a couple of months later this was
all known to the press but unreported
however there was a kind of response on
quite an interesting one the White House
made its a public statement it's the
only one I know of on the ma eye and in
that statement that an Under Secretary
of State and the Trade Representative
assured their audience that the Clinton
administration was fervently committed
to the ideals of democracy and it was
making sure that as they put it the
domestic constituencies that have a
vital stake in this issue are informed
and directly involved and in fact they
said the u.s. is leading the way at the
OECD and ensuring that this will be the
case this public statement as far as I
know was never reported but it's an
interesting if you think it through it
tells you very clearly what how the
democratic process and the Universal
Declaration are conceived by those in
power so who are the domestic
constituencies
were directly involved and have a stake
well not Congress because they weren't
informed certainly not the public they
were kept out of it totally thanks to
the free press and its commitment to
article 19 of the UD but some that there
were domestic constituencies which were
informed and intimately involved like
the US Council for business operations
well
think it through it's not a very hard
job you learn an important lesson one
that really ought to be taught in eighth
grade civics and you know graduate
departments of political science and so
on it's a lesson that's the powerful
rarely Express with such vulgar clarity
their total contempt for democracy and
their fear and hatred of the Great Beast
so it makes sense makes good sense for
all of this to be suppressed article 14
is just too dangerous to power to be
allowed to survive our 19 the one that
grants people the right of access to me
to information through the media and so
on
well it's kind of interesting that and
very interesting and an important lesson
that despite the valiant efforts of the
Free Press to keep the great beast
uninformed it nevertheless escaped the
cage grassroots opposition became so
powerful that the OECD the rich
countries were forced to back down the
target date for the NAI was April 27th
and they couldn't sign and they
explained why they said this is too much
opposition that's quite a victory for
grassroots up a grassroots opposition
grassroots organizing confronting the
most powerful concentration of power in
the world maybe that ever existed the
rich countries in the OECD the
transnational corporations the
international financial institutions all
strongly in favor of it Free Press
completely backed
almost with rare exceptions is in Canada
and nevertheless they couldn't Ram it
through the reaction has been
interesting in the business president
so the Financial Times of London which
is as I said the major international
Business Journal they had an article be
whaling this outcome the discrete said
that hordes of vigilantes I'm quoting
hordes of vigilantes had overwhelmed the
OECD and the corporate world using their
organizational abilities and their
strong finances and their influence with
the media I'm quoting all of this in the
US the influence of the media was zero
it was barely above and every elsewhere
in the OECD but the point is that even
the slightest breach in total
subordination is regarded as a
catastrophe to the Collett Arian mind
the article goes on to say that it will
be necessary to drum up business support
to beat back the horrors you know
overwhelmed by the vigilantes they then
quote diplomats and World Trade
Organization officials who fear quoting
that there may no longer be it may no
longer be possible to do deals behind
closed doors and submit them for rubber
stamping by Parliament as in the good
old days the the Australian trip it's
important
people feel how many people feel quite
unjustly discouraged and gloomy about
the opportunities to do things but there
have been really remarkable victories in
the last couple years and this is one of
the most dramatic of them and the
business world knows even if they won't
tell you the president Australia blamed
what they called the xenophobic hysteria
of the unholy alliance of aid groups
labor and environmentalists in the New
Republic columnist and wailed about what
he called the Flat Earth and black
helicopter crowd that are on the loose
determined to find out what's being done
to them by the serious guys who are used
to doing deals behind closed doors and
then having them rubber-stamp well
that's important the threat of democracy
is quite real and it's a major and
encouraging victory for popular activism
against very great odds the game isn't
over of course class war is much too
serious a matter to relinquish but let's
proceed to the universality of the
universal declaration of having
dismissed article 13 14 and 19 as
inoperative
by virtue of the extreme relativism of
the United States with regard to the
Universal Declaration
well these articles all fall within
civil and political rights that's the
category that the u.s. considers
privileged I'll return to some more in
that category if there's time but first
let's have a look at the second category
the socio-political rights
well according the principle of
universality these have the same status
as the political and civil rights but
the leaders of the Western relativists
challenge they insist that the Universal
Declaration must be modified in accord
with their values which assign no status
to the socio-economic principles Jeanne
Kirkpatrick once described them as a
letter to Santa
not to be taken seriously
Morris Abram who's the US representative
to the UN Commission on Human Rights was
a few years ago he spelled that out in
explaining Washington's opposition to a
convention that was being considered as
the convention on the right to
development here's the definition of it
the right of individuals groups and
people's to participate in contribute to
and enjoy economic social cultural and
political development in which all human
rights can be fully realized Abrams
pointed out that Morris Abram pointed
out that these are not rights in fact
they're preposterous you said they're in
fact that dangerous incitement the error
of the Convention on the right to
development is that it endorses the
principle that everyone has the right to
a standard of living adequate for health
and well-being of himself and his family
including food clothing housing and
medical care and social services and the
right to security in the event of
unemployment sickness disability
widowhood old age or the lack of
livelihood in circumstances beyond his
control notice that's a virtual
paraphrase of the right of development
that's preposterous and a dangerous to
science incitement so therefore that
must be preposterous even a dangerous
incitement and we therefore abrogate
article 25 of the Universal Declaration
which have just quoted notice that it
includes the right to security and in
fact it's worker insecurity that is the
key to the fairy tale as the saintly
Allen has explained well the u.s. vetoed
the Declaration on the right to
development effectively nullifying
article 25 I don't have to bother
spending
on how well article 25 is observed here
there are other elements involved in
article 25 the World Health Organization
has pointed out that what it calls the
devastation of hunger isn't is clearly
in violation of article 25 it's
transparent they also pointed out that
there are more deaths every two years
from hunger than during both world wars
but that has no status from the
relativist
standard of the rich in fact the u.s.
acts forthrightly to increase hunger and
that's the most striking example of that
is the embargo against Cuba since 1962
which is the longest sanction and
history and the only one that
effectively bars food and medicine
that's a direct violation of article 25
it's also a direct violation of a
principle that the United States of the
United States itself has introduced into
the at the Human Rights Commission the
u.s. at the Commission the United States
introduced a resolution declaring that
the deliberate impeding of delivery of
food and medical supplies to civilian
populations is a violation of
international humanitarian law and those
who commit it or order such acts are to
be held individually responsible that's
fair and accurate an accurate
interpretation of international law
meaning people responsible for this
should be brought before international
tribunals the references to Bosnia but
of course it applies very clearly to
every president of the United States
since the early 1960s that however would
be complete
incomprehensible to Western relativists
times going on and I won't have time to
run through the rest but if you run
through the rest of the socio-economic
provisions that you discover that the
respect for them is approximately
comparable the u.s. opposition to the
Universal Declaration is so extreme and
so deeply internalized among educated
people that they simply can't comprehend
when it's challenged that leads to some
very strange results for example in the
New York Times on Human Rights Day a
couple years ago December 10th the
editors condemned the countries of Asia
that as they put it reject the Universal
Declaration and call instead for
addressing the more basic needs for
people for food and shelter medical aid
and schools exactly in conformity with
the universal declaration but so how can
any rejection well the reasoning is very
simple the United States rejects these
provisions so therefore their null and
void and by upholding them the
third-world relativists are rejecting
them all it takes is a good education to
understand all of this and an
intellectual class that is willing to
subordinate itself to power to quite a
remarkable extent this came up again a
little bit later in a more kind of
philosophical discussion in the New York
Times about the u.s. us-china relations
they the article contrasted the American
emphasis on individual freedom with the
Chinese insistence on quoting it that
the Chinese insistence that the common
good transcends personal right so China
is calling for the right to food
clothing shelter education the right to
work rest reasonable payment and it's
criticizing the United States for not
upholding these rights which are all
affirmed in the universe
declaration and incidentally our
personal rights but rights that the US
reject so the conclusion is it's kind of
ironic or puzzling because the US is the
champion of the universality of the
Universal Declaration and somehow the
Chinese are criticizing it and the point
is it's easily understandable if China
just doesn't understand the Western
concept of human rights which the
relativist Western position led by the
United States China was insisting on the
universality of the Universal
Declaration which the u.s. rejected so
that's all incomprehensible to properly
educated people well one of the crucial
aspects of the Universal Declaration is
a call for efforts to make sure that the
rights described in words actually
become law or become applicable that's
to be done by what are called enabling
conventions conventions that the United
Nations will propose and that States
will accept that implement particular
aspects of the Universal Declaration and
there's a long series of these enabling
conventions for example there's a
convention on rights of the child in
1989 which was accepted by most
countries not all however it was
rejected by the United States and
Somalia alone there's a an International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
that was technically ratified by the
United States but with reservations
there was a reservation to article 7
which states that no one shall be
subject to torture or to cruel inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment the
reason why the u.s. refused to accept
that part is that conditions in US
prisons and other practices like the
death penalty are even for children the
virtually alone and allowing juveniles
to be executed Iran Saudi Arabian
Pakistan do also that's and US prison
practices have repeatedly been condemned
including by Human Rights Watch as in
violation of this article and indeed in
violation of article 5 of the Universal
Declaration which prescribes cruel
inhuman degrading punishment long
studies by Human Rights Watch in this
that you'll have to look for all right
to find them I mean unless you're
subscribed the Human Rights Watch
publications well the US has I think the
worst record in the industrial world at
least maybe one of the worst in the
world in ratifying enabling conventions
and in fact if you look closely you find
that it has respected Lee ratified none
because even though the one even though
what the few that have been ratified
have been designated inapplicable in the
United States technically they're called
non-self-executing can apply them that's
radical violation of the you know
Universal Declaration which specifically
calls for enabling conventions to to
turn the principles into practice well
that's just a tiny sample I could go on
for a long time in fact they have enough
notes here to go on for another couple
of hours but the conclusions of the
sample I think are pretty clear they're
clear about policy they're clear about
practices they're clear about the
intellectual culture that tolerates and
supports them the record is also clear
about what can be done to modify and
reverse these practices and crimes and
it's very much within our power to do so
there's a kind of a reasonable way to
proceed to figure out what the motives
are we can run through the possibilities
see if some of them can be excluded we
can sort of narrow down some
possibilities they're left the one that
immediately comes to mind then the first
one to pay attention to is the one that
is universally expressed and
vociferously expressed and never
questioned it
now that's close to truth I mean you
know maybe there's some statistical
error that's occasionally questioned but
you have to look hard to find it that is
that you hear it in high places no Tony
Blair I want all bright commentary
reporting editorials of this take one
example because it's close to home the
Boston Globe the day of it is completely
typical this is unfair to the globe the
the day of the last latest bombings
there was an editorial called
adjust attack and the reason it was one
reason for it and it's a standard one
there's Saddam is a vengeful despot who
has already used chemical and biological
weapons on his own citizens which is the
ultimate part obviously such a creature
has to be destroyed poses an enormous
threat can't be tolerated so you bomb
and impose sanctions and so on that's
that's essentially the universal you the
universal explanation unshown
even kind of instructive exercise would
be to check to see to what extent
there's been any question raised about
that justification well that
justification does have at least one
merit it's very easily tested it takes a
minute to test it you simply have to ask
what was the u.s. British reaction when
Saddam Hussein carried out the ultimate
heart that is used chemical weapons
against his own people he certainly did
no doubt but he's a monster and he
certainly used they carried out this act
of his a vengeful descoth who has used
chemical weapons against his own people
that sound doubtedly true in 1988 when
he carried out a major several times
gassing campaign against Kurds he also
used the nerve gas and chemical weapons
other chemical weapons and so on on the
war against Iran that was just finishing
up at that time and in fact the use of
increased till the end so it happened
and there is a reaction on the part of
the United States and Britain and the
Boston Globe and everybody else is
talking about it and see what that
reaction is it's on the record well the
reaction was that the United States has
written increased their support for
their this issue certainly has arisen I
mean for example Madeleine Albright is
after your call with that on the
national TV but you were two years ago I
guess she was asked on 60 minutes what
she thought about the fact that about it
was reported that about half a million
Iraqi children had been had died as a
result of the sanctions which are
putting us in a better position to deal
with Arachne human rights violations and
she said then she agreed that this was a
hard choice and then she said we think
the price is worth so that's the moral
level of the way in which we deal with
Iraqi human rights violations by killing
half main erected children
prices we're willing to pay that price
that's nice to hear the subsidies for
our favorite killer when he was carrying
out the ultimate horror we're not
restricted to subsidized agricultural
exports they also included technical
equipment dual use equipment equipment
it could be used for military purposes
helicopters for example a lot of
equipment which could could even be used
for production of chemical and
biological warfare this was all revealed
afterwards that went on the at the time
the there was suspicion that Saddam
Hussein had biological warfare
facilities the u.s. denied he's our
friend after all he wouldn't do that
sort of thing but they were discovered
by a very good journalist he was at that
time the Middle East reporter for ABC
television Charlotte glass he was able
to find high-level Iraqi defectors in
London general actually and from
information that he got from them using
French commercial satellites which are
low rated but certainly nothing like
he was able to locate and identify
biological warfare facilities and ABC
television let him run a spot on the
news showing biological warfare
facilities giving the evidence from
affecting Iraq in general then they
switched immediately through their
Pentagon correspondent who concluded
said again says this is nonsense I
forget about it and the story died now
those same biological warfare facilities
are being presented as proof that the
this reincarnation of the Atilla the Hun
has to be destroyed by the mass
awareness population same ones and
you're not supposed to remember that
either right according to the Iraqi
dissidents that there has been for a
long time a ban an official ban u.s.
government ban against any contact with
the record visitors with an accredited
opposition it's not because there's big
hopes or anything like that London
banker reserves professional but there
was a ban and according to Iraqi
decisions that then was had instituted
forcefully right after the last gassing
episode so as not to irritate our
friends Saddam Hussein I can't vouch for
that but that the ban has been in
operation is absolutely true effective
it's been reiterated repeatedly after we
got up to December 1989 January 1990 a
few months after that in April a group
of high-ranking US senators went to Iraq
they met with Saddam and the Kurdish
city of Mosul remembered the courage of
the ones
yes there were the delegation was headed
by Robert dole who brought the
president's greetings to the Sadam Alan
Simpson who I think is over at the
Kennedy School now he was in the
delegation he told the Saddam that the
Saddam's problems are not with the
American government which has no
objections to him they are with some
journalists loose cannons and he advised
Saddam Allah what he should do is invite
them to Iraq so they could kind of see
for themselves you know
disabuse of these notes and Israeli
scholar Millie scholar writing about
this in retrospect says accurately that
the forming before the dictator reminded
him a minute that's pretty good analogy
well that's up to April 1990 it's
already two years after that a larger
Massacre the ultimate her the and this
carries us up to this continues up until
the day of the invasion of Kuwait so
that's when overwhelmingly Saddam
Hussein's crimes were committed during
that period some some of the worst
months were committed afterwards I'll
come to that but the major ones were
committed up to that period the u.s.
supported him all the way through in
fact with a good deal of enthusiasm sort
of written what tells us something it
tells us that they can't just by
elementary logic the crimes can't be the
reason why we have to destroy the
monster I mean nothing could be more
obvious than that well what about the
threat was quite said I'm saying that's
real that threat peaked in the late
1980s thanks to our support that's the
time when he
when he was most threatening and most
powerful there's a measure of how great
the threat was that was at the in the
use of Bennett wool he had attacked the
grin with our support and there was a
war going on he was unable to defeat
Iran that's a country which had just
decimated its officer corps military at
the time of the revolution from any
revolution was led to Khomeini
even with the Iranian military largely
designated Iraq was unable to defeat
them with the support of the United
States Russia Britain Western Europe and
the Arab states so it gives you a
measure of the threat at its peak but
the u.s. today
comparison Iraq who said well Charlie
glass again growth in a recent article
the Iraqi army is approximately back to
what it was when the British established
it established it as they means to
suppress the population violently so
that the rulers would be able to export
oil to the west and ensure that the
profits go to the west not to the people
of the region that's the role of the
most of the armies in the Middle East
and the Arachne armies about back to
that level its equipment is antiquated
it's far weaker than what has a lot of
the weapons have been destroyed and
that's much my mom but by the inspection
system which has destroyed a lot of
weapons and the first by the destruction
of the economy so yes it's a threat
there was a much greater threat ten
years ago and how did the US and Britain
react to the threat at its peak we
already mentioned it but the main
reaction was the increase the threat
that was the reaction at the peak of the
threat and the u.s. took it very
seriously
remember how serious it was bear in mind
that Iraq in made man thanks 1987
Arachne missiles struck the US destroyer
star killing 37 sailor
37 personnel and they got kind of tack
on the wrist but that's it that shows
you you're really committed to somebody
the what was the u.s. stark doing there
well the US at that the US Navy at that
time was being introduced into the Gulf
to back up Iraq and support them in the
war against Iran and of course in his
war against his own population that
continued that alliance strengthened a
year later in July 1988 another way the
u.s. worship the event has shut down
Amon Iranian commercial airline just
taking off from writing an airport
flourish with airliner killed 290 people
it was plainly in a commercial chant
check farther in fact the ship was in
Iranian territorial waters that's that
was taken seriously to you by that point
Iran recognized the reality they
for the world with Iraq but they could
not fight in Iraq the u.s. alliance and
with the US Navy now acting aggressively
and there's no the head of the they cut
the u.s. plans credible that good enough
any very seriously that it was mistaken
for inner Iraq Ferdinand I Ryan military
plan with the Iranian Air Force pointed
out right away that the US was not
shooting down low-flying Arachne plans
which were very visible and the warp
link were warplanes on one of them it
attacked the star Iran recognized at the
time that the game is over they can and
they essentially shortly after that well
that's the peak of the Iraqi threat
thanks to our contribution and Saddam in
fact used his increased power very
quickly five days after the ceasefire he
turned to another major gas attack
against Kurds in the north five days
after the ceasefire the u.s. reaction
i've already described well just put
this together and we've now at least
eliminated one candidate for what the
motives were mainly the candidate that
is universally presented without
question and with great vigor run force
we know as well we know anything with
that can't be correct just on the
grounds of elementary logic as I said
it's an instructive exercise as you
might try to see how often this little
exercise in elementary logic has been
carried out in the
you're about you know the beach the fact
that so for example during the latest
bombings it's interesting you know I
think area to know the answer without
looking but it's worth finding out and
it raises questions about the world in
which we live most of us live in the
world that symbolized by the Harvard
Square the world is sort of you know for
thinking and by minds and analysis so on
and so forth you can think about it and
it's worth thinking about because it's
significant that has to do with it what
reaches the public how it reaches the
public if this is being concealed what
does it tell you alright let's go on to
that there is an event that did change
Saddam Hussein from favorite friend to
the Beast of Baghdad namely august 2nd
1990 by running invaded quake what about
that is that why we have to sanction you
know impose the sanctions that are
killing people and so on well that's
pretty worth arguing one thing is not
any weight and it's not very much okay
but that's clearly the major event was
that a major crime sure to work on
invading in other countries of war crime
that's the thing for which people were
hanging to Nuremberg and so on
on the other hand was it a serious crime
well pretty hard to argue in comparison
with the rest of Saddam's criminal
record which we had supported it's like
having a toothpick through a mountain
furthermore it was recognized
it's not to be a very serious crime
in fact the great fear of us leaders at
the time of the invasion as Colin Powell
achieving staff is that Iraq would
quickly withdraw leading a puppet regime
in place and then all the Arab states
would be happy Colin Powell virtual
quote that was the expectation in fact
it was called the nightmare scenario
they were afraid it might happen
how much of the crime would that have
been well we can measure that too if in
fact the expectations of the US
leadership have been fulfilled Saddam
would have essentially duplicated that
the United States had just done a couple
months ago in Panama that is invaded put
in a puppet government and then
withdrawn leaving it in place the puppet
government happened to be a government
of bankers and market traffickers but it
was in place and it's maintained
essentially but us forced from a
distance so said I'm the only different
real difference between the two cases is
that Hong Kong had been correct they're
saying that the Arabs would have been
all the Arab states would have been
happy though it certainly wasn't through
of Latin America the there was
tremendous opposition to the US invasion
in Panama and elsewhere and indeed that
remains other than that the es analogy
is pretty close
however there's a crucial difference in
the case of panama of the US was able to
veto to the Security Council resolutions
condemning it vote against General
Assembly resolution
which effectively beat does it in the
basis you're right however the u.s. of
course the resolution stood and
subsequent events took place which are
worth going over which I'll skip for
lack of time but what they essentially
amounted to was us efforts with the
strong cooperation media to suppress the
possibilities that this nightmare
scenario might take place and to ensure
that the conflict would end in the arena
of force and violence were the USS first
supreme and that happened that's
interesting story will figure so then
comes Brooke the February 1991 the
massacre it ended at the end of the
month and shortly afterwards within days
Saddam Hussein turned to the next most
curious science of his career the first
most serious ones being warms that
Boston Globe when everyone else is
referring to they were chemical warfare
against his own citizens mediate after
the war there was an uprising in
southern Iraq the Shiite areas to the
south
led by rebellion Iraqis generals this is
right under the nose in the US Army
nominated cold reason Stormin Norman as
they're watching following orders from
Washington the uprising the rebellions
minerals and did not ask for assistance
they asked for access the capture direct
the equipment they're supported by Saudi
Arabia who also requested the United
States to allow them have at least
access to cash
equipment us accused it refused to do
anything to deter the vicious Arachne
response there at the government
response which was regal and murderers
even to let you know the rebels had
access to equipment they wanted the u.s.
clearly wanted benefits at the state
that it wanted the revolt affair and it
it was crushed with extreme violence
right after that revolt began in the
north Kurdish areas in the same story
were enacted the u.s. refused to act to
give any assistance whatsoever to the
rebels in fear that they might succeed
that is that might overthrow to be
suspected this was so immediately
destroyed immediately after the war was
over the u.s. essentially returned to
support for its favorite murder as he
again carried out really atrocious and
dishes act again with our support well
that was kind of too visible to the
press at the time so there was an
official investigation for and it
remains until today true you know they
defended their sensibilities and so on
but it was necessary in order maintain
something called stability disabilities
very important to maintaining stability
and in order to maintain stability we
had to keep the beast of Baghdad and
power even though he was carrying a huge
secures himself in the north through
their tacit support the State Department
wine as it was presented by its
representative with the New York Times
that's the position called sheath
diplomatic correspondent was that the
what he said the best of all worlds from
the point of view of the United States
the best of all worlds would be an
iron-fisted military Clinton that would
rule Iraq just the way Saddam Hussein
had done but it would be nice if it
didn't have Saddam Hussein's naina name
on it because that's kind of embarrassed
and he went on the city's latest expert
that this would be greatly to the
satisfaction of their allies Turkey in
Saudi Arabia which is probably true he
left out the most striking case because
it's indelicate to mention it but as he
and every other reporter following the
Middle East knew it would be much to the
pleasure of their ally Israel which is
the only country that I know of
where there was openness and public
support across the spectrum for the
crushing of the Kurdish were bedded and
of course southern forbidden that
extended from the chief of staff all the
way across the leading doze and it was
in the English press too so nobody could
have missed it this for articles in The
Jerusalem Post and they give the reason
she terms and what the reasons were that
an independent Kurdistan and then
encourage state would create a land
harder between Syria and Iran which are
their enemies so they didn't want this
so therefore they wanted the u.s. to
allow Saddam the question of the Kurds
that's I don't think that was ever
recorded here either that was extremely
finally makes its decision than choice
not to report it well that's that's this
continues couple years later in 1996
brent scowcroft was Bush's National
Security Advisor was asked in an
interview what he thought about this and
he said it would not necessarily have
been to our interests to that said on
the st. overthrown because any
replacement and I have been mine works
so therefore we were right to support
Saddam while he carried out his second
the second worst crimes of his career
namely depression in the southern and
northern rebellions and so it continues
just yesterday the general who had the
central command
I said essentially the same thing day
before it's reported in yesterday's
paper
generals Enoch and the matter albreath
has chimed in to in an interesting way
in December while claiming saying that
the US had changed policies she said
here's what she said last December we
have come to the determination that the
Iraqi people would benefit if they had a
government that really represented again
guess where that this religious
conversion is true or not but if it is
we don't have to worry about what does
it mean that in december nineteen
the US government had a revelation and
decided it would be nice if the Iraqi
people had a government the
representative them instead of the least
the Baghdad and we've been supported
let's say she's requested for remark is
true what did it tell us okay
furthermore is to add to the story
during this very same period early 90s
our favorite ally Turkey worse which has
one of the worst Human Rights records in
the world was increasing its own
murderous attack against the Kurds in
southeastern Turkey from 19 just as if
one measure of that about a million
Kurds fled to the our back here the sort
of unofficial Kurdish capital in
southeastern Turkey during those years
at 1994 was a peak year in two respects
it was the year in which Turkish terror
against the Kurds heat and it was the
year which US military ate the turkey
beef in fact in that year turkey became
the leading the world's leading importer
of us are those are two things that
typically go along together there's a
very close correlation between terror
and violence and US military not only in
that region
well somehow that didn't mean that we
had to impose sanctions on the people of
Turkey to kill hundreds of thousands of
their children because this is good
terror
that's territory death by RLI at the
same year well with that proceeding it's
plain that there cannot
in any moral or humanitarian motives
behind any English going on and it
certainly can't possibly have been the
official motor the ones that are
recorded by say Boston Globe editors
cannot be Saddam's crimes that are
motivating this that again is just
elementary logic what about the threat
of weapons of mass destruction well
that's again there's a number of
problems suppose we're concerned about
weapons of mass destruction then one
question obviously is how comma wasn't
true in 1988 when it was a much more
serious threat than it is today question
second question is the latest bombings
for example are justified a part of the
mystification is that they were supposed
to reduce Saddam's capacity to produce
weapons of mass destruction but it was
conceded it wants in advance in fact
that the bombings would have the
opposite effect they would increase that
capacity that was conceded because it
was obvious the effect of the major
effect of the bombing would be to
eliminate our skies you know the
Youngstown inspections okay he's
thinking believes Scott Ritter one of
the chief inspectors who resigned from
once come
the US have already underlined on Scott
by turning into spiders which
essentially destroyed it he said it's
like quit but certain but whether he's
right or not about that probably is in
December the bombing
was it was understood in advance and
stated that yes this will a limited make
it extremely hard for us convey
continued its mission and the inspection
mission is the regime is the only thing
that's defective well that's been pretty
successful quite successful and would
remain so but of course once that's
broken it's not going to happen
the so the in fact if you look at the
official Warren's last December they
made it pretty clear they said the
official line is to degrade Saddam's
weapons capacity and as number of people
noticed that means they don't know water
at all of course you know you shoot one
bullet at a door and degrade the
capacity it's meaningless there were no
credible war ends in fact they the
effect of the bombing could only be to
increase the alleged danger probably
will be then but what's interesting is
it doesn't matter I mean the fact that
there are no credible warring and that
the standard reason is doesn't even rise
to a little bit joke doesn't matter at
all it's still just attack and we must
march in a parade right vision we must
act as it
Pelletier in society following orders
marching in a parade even though we've
recognized that the marching orders are
idiotic and would collapse under 30
seconds of inquiry and that the motive
for this last attack is that the
effective it'll be the opposite of
what's planned despite knowing all of
that we must march on a parade if you're
an educated responsible citizen walk
around places like this that's the way
or it's indicated not because of
something about the expectation sports
and about the values that are apparent
but educated people give us me I'm not
getting orders to do this they just do
it naturally well turn going back to
weapons of mass destruction there is
indeed a way to eliminate the capability
of producing one and only one way and
that is Carthaginian solution you mr.
Pullo destroy the society you do that
they won't be able to do so it comes
with massive structure if you leave an
infrastructure yeah
you leave educational and scientific
facilities of any client and if there's
a revenue flow then you get a capacity
to produce weapons of mass destruction
so the only way to end that capability
we talk about terminating it yeah there
is a way wipe the place out speak for a
single reason Iraq is the second largest
oil producer in the world and that's
much
but of course you worry about its
population in fact it's and way too
beneficial to do that you look at the
history of oil production around the
world you find that it's mostly takes
place as focus on and what surprised is
areas where there aren't very many
people a lot of but not too many people
because then there's no pressure
too little pressure to stop the profits
from going the people who really should
have the US Treasury and so on
so as the population of Iraq were
reduced or marginalized maybe reduced to
such a level
maybe now but produces such a level that
they're barely functional then by the
time when the time comes to bring Iraqi
production back in month along as it
will they'll be less of an impediment
it'll be more or less a saturated where
there's a lot of oil but no people
around the president for economic
development and educational facilities
and so on and so forth so that's kind of
all to the good there is a way then to
eliminate the capability but and that's
the only way other than that can't be
done well without proceeding further it
seems when we can eliminate the standard
reasons from consideration they cannot
be the reasons and the motive for what's
going on
mentor grounds effects I began to
explore or fun rather ugly story what is
left what is left is what comes to
should come to mind that once when
anybody mentions the word Middle East
when you mention that word what comes to
mind is oil truth them tomorrow back in
the 1940s the United States recognize
that region rating Peninsula the Persian
Gulf to be what they call this dependent
sources of strategic power the greatest
material prize in world history
strategically most important area in the
world and just kind of going off into
average space and then and of course
that meant to us has to control that men
kicking out arrivals France
marginalizing Britain they're allowed to
play a secondary role as long as they're
properly obedient and loyal attack dog
but the but essentially the US has been
controlled you don't give up greatest
material prize in the world history and
you know stupendous sources to teaching
power so the US has to control well
that's a problem because there are
people in the region they get out of
hand
they want to benefit from their own
resources and so on so there's constant
conflict the the comfortably this issue
is very serious right now right now at
the moment there's an oil glut you go to
the gas station and the prices are lower
than in real terms than they've been
since the Second World War and the oil
price is low it's like that's one reason
why it's beneficial to the United States
to keep the Iraqi oil off the market the
United States don't want the oil prices
up to low it's always wanted it to stay
within a range not too high because
there would be harmful to us
manufacturers and so on but not too low
because that's harmful to the US based
to the energy producers which are mostly
us-based either u.s. and their profits
go down and furthermore the petrol
dollars you know this the money that's
gotten from selling oil flows a lot of
it flows right back here US Treasury
securities construction projects
military production and so on and that
flow has to be maintained so you don't
want the oil price to get too low
temporarily at least it's good idea to
keep your FDA local market because it
was on well the prices go even lower and
that's not good the other problem with
Iraqi oil is that the inside track right
now on developing near ful is held by
France and
about us-based majors we don't want that
so right for moment at least keeping the
Iraqi oil from being developed as a wise
from some point of view wise project is
this gonna last
well not if the consensus of geologists
is correct details are always uncertain
especially in the case of oil production
because most of the information is in
the hands of the oil companies aren't
telling anybody but there's a pretty
reasonable consensus that this is
temporary that sometime in the
not-too-distant future they'll be in oil
prices the rate of discovery which
increased from mid 19th century steadily
peaked at around 1965 has been declining
ever since that is with new technology
and deep 3d drilling and everything else
still the rate of discovery has been
declining the rate of oil uses on the
other hand has been increasing after the
so-called president 1973 when the prices
shut up from that period until today
there had about almost half of the total
oil consumption in history has been
since that time that's the last 25 years
and it's it's expected that this kind of
magic 50% mark where you've used up 50%
of the exploitable oil that's expected
to come not too far in the future and if
you think extend these trend lines you
can see what's happening maybe a decade
or a couple of decades and people
disagree about the date but not a
qualitatively furthermore most of the
remaining or else on the middle east the
percentage of exploitable oil in the
Middle East is inclusive the other
regions but like Alaska North Sea were
always known
quite small that comparison and they're
kind of reaching exhaustion the Middle
East will remain as the major center
primarily Saudi Arabia secondarily Iraq
and you know but unless there's
something that nobody knows about that
will continue that it means that control
over this region is going to be
extremely important if James Aikens is
the an old oil man who was the former US
ambassador to Saudi Arabia recently said
is it only a semi true that when the
price per barrel well oil gets up to $30
you'll see that Saddam Hussein will turn
into Mother Teresa that's sort of
captures the point I think the but of
course only if the u.s. if US based
majors get first you know first pickings
on certainly none of the erected people
the it's a region of a lot of complex
crises and conflicts many of them
related to justice fact that people in
the region have never accepted the fact
that the profits from their sole
resource should go to the west and that
leads to all sorts of problems to main
to maintain control that's been
necessary to have brutal regimes around
which will suppress their own
populations well you know the family
dictatorships in the golfer too weak to
do that they're they have to be kept
weak so that we look they're cold but
they can then on the force
really refresh population so there's
always been what Nixon's secretary
defense called the Crocs on the beat and
our local police force of tough guys
around the region to keep order and
they're preferably non error because
they do better shooting Arabs apparently
this and there's been such an alliance
that was the main role of Iran as long
as it's under the show or the u.s.
supported them so strongly in the main
role of Israel particularly since 1967
turkeys another major Pakistan has been
another this ring of non Arab states are
supposed to keep order right there is
there's a lot of conflict now about but
they do you have to bear in mind that
the u.s. is isolated the US and Britain
are isolated now internationally and
regionally not only on the issue of Iraq
but also in the issues Iran it was very
isolated on that that's the background
for the conflicts that are going on
about a pipeline from the Caspian region
the most most of the producers and in
fact even the oil companies I wanted her
to pipeline through Iran which is the
most secure and the cheapest
staple irritants on the US is refusing
it's insisting that the pipeline go
through Turkey they also wanted to cut
out of Russia and there's a lot of
conflict over this the Caspian region is
you know it's not like the Middle East
it's a substantial oil reserves nobody
thinks it's not far it's the Arabian
Peninsula only and the Gulf it's just
another secondary source but still
there's plenty money to be made there
and there's a conflict between the
United States and Europe the United
States and Russia the United States of
China there's a lot of conflict about
how that how the projects are going to
be sharing that pipeline is part of the
United States is trying to keep you ran
out even in opposition to the us-based
oil but is in this case a unique case
usually the well
the that doesn't mess that's going to
handle this how's it going to run in the
region in the face of these conflicts
and acquisitions well you know if you're
involved in any kind of conflict whether
it's a card game or anything at most you
try to play your strong hand you try to
shift things around so that they'll be
in the arena in which you're strong
the US has comparative advantage in
exactly one area for some time not a
drug enforcement violence it is unpaired
nobody comes close so it makes good
sense for planners to try to play that
hands just everything into that arena
and that I think is exactly what we're
seeing I think that's what we saw when
the US bomb Sudan for example destroying
its major pharmaceutical plant it's
interesting to notice how little
attention was given to that in the
United States I mean if there had been
an Islamic terrorist attack that
destroyed half of us pharmaceutical and
facilities you think somebody might have
noticed but this one was just Africa who
cares so we a pharmaceutical plant I
think that that message was understood
by the people to whom that was like that
sent namely people in Tehran and Riyadh
Saudi Arabia Iran they're saying look a
weird a violent Wallace statement is
force to get what we want
I think that's probably the reason for
the December prime reason for the
December bombings too but one thing
where we have overwhelming overwhelming
demand
first it doesn't matter if the excuses
are not credible it doesn't matter if
the effect of the bombing is the
opposite of what we claim we're after we
can count on educated Americans the
marching parade say anything and we'll
show you we will understand but we'll
show you that what we say goes George
Bush's definition of the New World Order
while the missiles were dropping in
February 1991 I think that's the message
and that's understood well the state get
out of the way or else that's I think
actor Lee I think that all accounts for
the very clear and open contempt for
international law that's been pretty
dramatic in this case not gonna say
anything new but it's the the flaunting
of it is kind of dramatic so there's
just no doubt at all that the bomber
just to pick a minor incident the
bombing of Iraq or the bombing of Sudan
which are minor context that those were
flat-out violations of the UN Charter in
other words more were crimes and that
was understood
so it was condemned by the Vatican as
aggression it was the Arab world was
condemned as aggression all over the
place in India
national and Ashe International Council
of URIs and the other major lawyers were
elected bringing cases the World Court
charging Clinton and Blair with were
crimes
assembly 22nd I had a friend through a
database search receiving find any
reference to it was no reference to it
but this and the word but the point is
this you know that this is aggression a
war crime is pretty clear and obvious
but that's what it's supposed to be it's
supposed to be lying
Wallace Act it's kind of striking that
the issue the issue of whether this
violated the UN Charter fairly discussed
here it was discussed to some extent in
England but barely in effect condemned
in England for the extreme but not here
here there's much more visible when the
issue was mentioned at all which was
rare it was dismissed as a kind of
technicality that's important it's
getting late and I won't go through the
record but there's an interesting record
of explicit doctrine saying that we are
not subject to international law during
the Reagan years this became quite a
repetitive so when the bomb the
we admit them of the disturbing case was
the International Court of Justice when
it condemned the United States for the
war against Nicaragua was just dismissed
across the board Jo and the internal
reasons were interesting the State
Department had a legal analysis of what
it was
International Court of Justice was
irrelevant and the reason was that we
cannot count on members of the United
Nations to follow our opinion that's
exactly where he said and therefore the
International Court of Justice is ruling
on the appropriate floor
they said the United States will
determine its own determination of how
to deal with issues that affect its
interests and the issue at that time was
what of course issues that fall within
our domestic jurisdiction the issue that
fell within our domestic jurisdiction
then was the USSR against Nicaragua
since the outside world can't be trusted
to take the right position on this yet
lost as in 20 years this has become
totally over so Alan Albright when she
was UN ambassador simply told the UN we
will act
multilaterally when we can you know
if we missed you don't like it get lost
that was ever in Iraq kids in December
the official line was that quoting it we
prefer to act through our allies but if
not we lost along the floor unable to
elect alone
there's an interesting formulation it
goes a step further once we don't even
prefer to act through the United Nations
that's finished happens the
international law and the UN Charter say
that's the way to do it but that's
finished same reason that we can't count
on them anymore so they're irrelevant
we preferred AG through our allies that
were easily more less malleable but if
we can act through them will act along
the that the timing of the bomb was
selected in order to make this very
plain
recall that the bombing began just as
the UN an emergency meeting of the
Security Council was being called to
deal with the issue of Iraq the members
of the Security Council weren't notified
but as the meeting open the missiles
were flying they understood now that's a
message of contempt for the United
Nations saying you better understand
your irrelevant you don't come along
with it you don't follow us anymore the
way you used to when we started over
laughs so you're therefore out of it and
it was understood senior European
diplomat pointed out that at the time
that the United States has simply given
up on the United Nations and prefers to
act through NATO and the World Trade
Organization at least as long as they're
reliable sometimes they aren't so you
throw them out too well you know the
world should take notice and it does
outside of privileged circles for narrow
privileged circles and powerful circles
it's very well understood
it's if we should take notice too
it's quite important for us we have to
decide whether that's the national
persona that we want to project of
course for a rogue state things like
international law and UN Charter on the
meaning and especially a rogue state
that's violent and lawless and it's
projecting that as its persona that's
right they don't mean anything and that
gains particularly significance when
that rogue state happens to be the most
powerful state in the world
well if that's the national or something
we want okay but it's I think important
to recognize the dedication of the
educational information systems media
etcetera to suppress the obvious I think
this is fairly obvious unless that's
reversed I think you can be pretty
confident that there are ugly times
ahead particularly if the antis in the
Middle East particularly especially if
they anticipated that oil crisis becomes
reality well the answer to how seriously
we take that depends not on what happens
in this room about what happens in the
small groups that will be set up
afterwards that's where the important
things will happen on our estate
