as the financial crisis and economic
crisis deepens working people are asking
how bad is it going to get and how will
it affect me to help us answer those
questions we're joined by professor Noam
Chomsky who needs no introduction thanks
for joining us glad to be with you so a
few weeks ago George that George
Stephanopoulos show George will said the
following surely in a democracy it's
time for us to quit being sentimental
and say the question we settle an
election is not whether elite shall rule
but which no he could have been which
was a rather candid moment to see on
television but but if four people
ordinary people working people in swing
states now where their vote might help
determine which section of the elite is
going to rule should it matter to them
nobody should matter but does matter and
has mattered right through American
history actually George Will was
centrally correct in the terms of the
framing of the way American democracy is
supposed to work James Madison the main
framer his view as he expressed it at
the Constitutional Convention was that
power should be in the hands of the
wealth of the nation the responsible set
of men who men of course who respect the
rights of property and the goal of the
government should be to protect the
minority of the opulent against the
majority and that thesis runs right to
the contemporary period the perhaps the
most famous exponent of it was the
leading figure in American media the
leading public intellectual in the 20th
century walter Lippmann who wrote it
progressive essays on democracy he was a
Wilson roselle progressive his view was
that the population should be spectators
not participants they should that he
called them ignorant and meddlesome
outsiders who have to be kept out of the
political arena and we smart guys who
have to run things
have to be protected from the trampling
and the roar of the bewildered heard
that's you guys out there on the other
hand the population has never accepted
this has always struggled against it
jacksonian democracy is a famous case
but it continues the the benefits the
freedom the that we have now is because
of popular struggles the popular
struggles in the 1930s compelled the
government to create new deal measures
in the 1960s it led to civil rights
Medicare you know welfare state measures
women's rights and so on every single
one of them was if you look as the
result of people simply not accepting
the doctrine of a lead rule and it's
true today you just take a look at polls
a spectacular ninety-five percent of the
population which is amazing for a poll
object that the government doesn't pay
attention to popular opinion there's
been sort of a traditional analysis on
the left that there's a section of the
leap it's more connected to the military
industrial complex a section of the leak
that's more connected to domestic
economy needs a more vigorous domestic
purchasing power and certainly overlap
does that it does that analysis hold up
and if so for ordinary people is it
better to have one section of the elite
and power of the other I mean right now
if you're in a swing state your to
decide McCain or Obama is there a
decision that matters to people and what
would you suggest if you're in the swing
state well i would suggest voting
against mccain which means voting for
obama without illusions because all the
elevated rhetoric about change and hope
and so on will dissolve into standard
centrist democrat policies as soon as if
he takes office however there is a
difference and it's been studied quite
closely by political scientists there's
a
a strong difference over time no don't
see it in a particular moment but over
time the general population a large
majority of the population other than
very wealthy attends to do considerably
better under democratic than under
Republican administrations and the
reason is sort of what you said they
reflect different a leak constituencies
and and the differences are quite
striking and very noticeable so if
that's what matters to you that's
usually a pretty good guide for voting
it's not that the Democrats represent
public opinion they don't in fact like
the Republicans they're pretty well to
the right of public opinion on a host of
major issues including those of most
importance to the public in fact what's
happening now it's interesting it's not
being discussed is very striking tells
you a lot about American democracy for
years decades in fact one of the leading
concerns you've not the top concern of
the public has been the health care
system which is understandable to total
catastrophe has about twice the costs of
other industrial countries and some of
the worst outcomes and it's it's painful
for individuals if you've ever spent a
little time at an ER watching people
come for prevent you know a bad cold
that you can see what it's like we've
been doing work in various states
Northwest Indiana Virginia and other
places it's all people want to talk
about as the healthcare 600 jobs are
healthy and this good reason for it it's
a catastrophe it's getting much worse
it's going to swamp the federal budget
and the wreath the fundamental reason
for it is it's privatized that
introduces layer after layer of
bureaucracy cherry-picking the
supervision paperwork and that's the
hundreds of millions of dollars of waste
a year well up until the 2004 election
it was just off the agenda people
mentioned the Clinton program but that's
misunderstanding a program
with the pup what the public is wanted
is very straightforward they want a
national health care system usually
people pick Canada as the model model
not because it's the best system but
because it's right there you see it you
don't see the Australian system which is
better but the public over by large
majorities has favored a national health
care system say Medicare plus it's
sometimes called extended to the whole
population to be far cheaper far far for
now as long on its isn'ta there Obama
does not go then well it sees interest
it's quite interesting to see what's
happened up until two thousand four
nobody went there so the last debate
before the election in 2004 was on the
domestic economy and concerns and now
2008 is different in 2008 both
Democratic candidates Clinton and Obama
did it make proposals which as you say
we're not what the public wants but
we're approaching it well what happened
between 2004 and 2008 to make it
politically possible public opinion
didn't change what changed is that a
major sector of concentrations of real
power namely manufacturing industry they
change their position so General Motors
says that it costs them over a thousand
dollars more to make a car and Detroit
and cross the border in Windsor Canada
because of the inefficient healthcare
system well when a large sector of
concentrated capital concentrated
economic power becomes interested in
something it becomes politically
possible so now it's moving to the to
the political agenda that I'm getting
there what does that tell you about the
functioning of American democracy it's
very revealing and it is doubly
revealing that nobody comments on it
what does too in this segment of the
interview just to concentrate more on
the political the politics of this
election what do you say to the third
party candidates who say they are all
the same
they're there really is that that we're
that we're locked in this dilemma they
say of one party or the other there were
no lesser heels and such what do you say
to them when they say it really doesn't
make any difference who wins to say it
doesn't make any difference who wins is
simply to express your contempt for the
general population because it does make
a difference a lot of what they say is
correct the two parties are effectively
factions of one party the business party
but the factions are somewhat different
and as I mentioned over time the
differences show up in benefits working
conditions wages things that really
matter to people so yes there's a
difference it's a narrow difference and
the spectrum within the political system
is well to the right of popular opinion
incidentally the public is well aware of
it so eighty percent of the population
say that the government is run by am
quoting a few big interests looking out
for themselves not the population and
their can argue about the details but
the picture is essentially correct and
they don't like it nevertheless there is
some difference and you have to make a
choice if you're in a swing state you
have to ask is this difference enough
for me to pick the lesser of the two
evils and there's nothing wrong with
picking the lesser of two evils cliche
makes it sound like you're doing
something bad but no you're doing
something good if you pick the lesser of
two evils so is it worth doing that or
is it worth trying to act to create a
potential alternative for example should
I vote green because maybe someday
though their party building there'll be
a real alternative should i express my
disdain for the right-wing orientation
of both parties by not voting let's say
or should I pick the lesser of the two
evils thereby helping people okay that's
a decision people have to make in the
next segment of our interview let's talk
about the current financial crisis and
what what do people mean when they talk
about
the financial crisis and the real
economy as if they're two different
planets please join us for the next
segment of our interview professor Noam
