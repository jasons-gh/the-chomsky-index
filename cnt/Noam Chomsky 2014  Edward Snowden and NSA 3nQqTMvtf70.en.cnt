okay Stace danger I presume you're
referring specifically to Edward
Snowden's revelations about the National
Security Agency efforts I mean the fact
that government spying on their on their
enemies is not new and nor is it knew
that the domestic population is one of
the main enemies of just about every
government and every power system so
sure they're always going to try to spy
and control their domestic enemy that
goes back as far as history does people
who've been involved in activism always
been conscious of this I mean I was very
much involved in resistance against the
Vietnam War but we never used the
telephone symptoms tapped we never
talked about things sensitive things in
open meetings the probably infiltrators
assured that goes on a lot of time but
the scale of Obama's that President
Obama's efforts is just it was really a
shock there's never been anything
remotely like that I mean if any of you
anyone who is connected in any way to
the electronic culture is being spied on
or can be if you have a cell phone the
National Security Agency has in they may
not bother but in principle they have
access to where you are who you're
talking to what you say it's even true
of your cell phones off if you have a
computer the same thing is true the
Snowden revelations demonstrate that if
computers any electronic equipment
that's made in the United States
computers routers network materials that
go to the National Security Agency so
they can install equipment
to them which provides access to every
keystroke that you make everything
you're doing that presumably china does
the same thing to the extent that they
can that's doubtless they can't do it on
the scale of the United States which has
enormous capacity this is a system of
surveillance and control which is beyond
anything that anyone has ever dreamt of
either anything that was actually
realized like say the East German Stasi
or anything that was dreamt of dystopian
novelists like George Orwell and others
it's pretty phenomenal how do you defend
yourself against it by eliminating have
to eliminate it if it's going on there's
no way to defend yourself against it and
that's not an impossibility of the in
the US Congress they came very close to
a vote to ban to end all funding for the
National Security Agency they lost the
vote expanded but that's not impossible
it depends on the amount of popular
opposition that's true in Europe that's
driven the United States that's true in
countries with less influence in the
world but it's not going to happen by
itself like anything else if you just
decided to say I don't like it nothing's
going to stop but we have plenty of
opportunities for overcoming this real
crimes major crime actually it is
technically a crime in the United States
it's an explicit violation of the
Constitution explicit you take a look at
the use your internet get back to the
first question and take a look at the
Fourth Amendment to the Constitution
that's one of the initial parts of the
Constitution it's bands what's called
unreasonable search and seizure
guarantees the privacy of persons their
homes their
papers and their effects anything they
own that the reason that that was put in
was because this is right after the
American Revolution and one of the
things that sparked the revolution was
the insistence of the British imperial
masters that they had a right to
interfere with individual privacy that
led to confrontations and you know armed
confrontations in fact health set the
revolution off and this principle was
instantly introduced into the
consultative constitution at that time
the tyrant were the British rulers today
the tyrant is President Obama and the
American government so the government
lawyers of course will try to argue that
it's not illegal that's the job of
lawyers whatever whatever crime is being
committed but there is no way to make
these surveillance activities consistent
with the clear and explicit wording the
Constitution so it's technically
criminal the whole government should be
if laws really applied they'd all be
brought to justice for this of course
laws don't apply to the powerful some
others too but they should and the
public can make it happen but only by
direct activism no other way
