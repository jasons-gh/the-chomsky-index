well on the first question is how did
you originally become involved with the
professor trips on my involved or even
personal experience
can't remember when we met but over the
years potentially a lot of the strains
when the latest incidents all right well
let's see I did notice some quotes that
you would made to to the local media
intolerant around us it seemed they were
very supportive
that's right a free expression while
trying to avoid the issue of choice of
context and there wasn't someone trying
to avoid the issue first was irrelevant
oh so here's an accidental
since that time have you have you had
any interest in seeing the original SAT
animals right no okay all right I'm one
of the statements that I thought was
amiss very here is that or very
interesting it's that time you didn't
say that you never anything about us or
a fair amount of us we're running that
sometimes sure I was there anything in
that work that that today seems to stand
out or they might say that he follows
impressive scholarship I had read his
work on COINTELPRO to the topic I'd
worked on too since the 1970s so I was
interested in it I thought they he and
an associate did very good work on
collecting documentary record on
analysis in the commentary I have read
his work summers worth of all of it on
colonialism on history Native Americans
a lot of that I thought was got me
looking at sources and so on I can't
really comment and be filled without
going back to look at it carefully now
one of the statements I thought was very
interesting that you mentioned was right
now he is under investigation by I guess
the next step of the review consisting
of five people writers make the final
determination on the remaining charges
brought against which I believe are
plagiarism academic fraud the other
Chartist briefs which in terms of
freedom of expression I think they have
been promised you maybe made a statement
that I found interesting and you would
mention that if these charges were
serious
they wouldn't been brought up before and
and really I thought that these charges
might be more
and after the fact I thought would add
some information to that because the
Rocky Mountain it was actually a good
sized piece and all the instances that
Native American groups and individuals
including those Naqvi make different
questions there was my point the
investigation came after the collapse of
the charges against him for that reason
alone it's pretty hard to take him
seriously now people can make charges
anything suspicious anyone who's in the
public eye and it can be denounced from
all over the place but when I go home
tonight I'm gonna get the usual dose of
100 emails or so and I can predict that
there will be a selection among them
from at least four of the internet
industries there are huge internet
defamation industries that are operating
one of the floor will be maybe several
proving that I'm supporting Osama bin
Laden second will be proving that I want
old Jews to be sent to crematorium third
will be proving that I'm a CIA agent
trying to undermine the left a fourth
will be the only Mossad agent trying to
destroy Palestinian rights and then
there'll be a couple of others like you
know I want the tequila babies or
maybe but at least these four industries
will be going because they're going
strong and they've walked behind them I
mean anyone who's in the public eye
if you can't respond to it they say you
defame I'm if it's a really violent
state like our colonies you know at the
fame you blow the brains up like to that
picture over there which is what happens
to intellectuals and US colonies in this
case happens to be El Salvador six
leading Jesuit intellectual have their
brains blown out over on the right is
the archbishop who was assassinated
that's what we do to people in places
where we can use force at home we can't
do that so you have defamation so the
fact that the church I was referring to
was know if charges come how to if
charges are legitimate
they'll come not kind after cases
falling apart and that doesn't prove the
charges are illegitimate but to any
rational person it raises a very high
suspicions that the charges are just
after the failure to carry out a totally
legitimate inquiry and my question would
be that the original
people decided that the charges did have
merit you know the charges of plagiarism
those charges they were brought on the
occasion of a different charge
namely a charge about it talk he gave on
9/11 that's when the other charges came
along that alone tells any rational
person but it's pretty hard to take this
seriously if the charges were legitimate
why did they wait for that occasion I've
been in there being on the committee or
as a suspicion what right does a
university or a state or anyone have to
question what academic figure says could
there in the area of academic freedom on
the other side academic responsibility I
do understand the part that you're
saying is that these charges are brought
after the fact that they were never that
Steve did not decide to pursue them
regardless that they were
retention is certain area in these
charges of academic responsibility in
terms of it seems they're questioning
whether he did follow proper scholarship
that would be possible you could take
the entire Harvard faculty and
investigate them as to how it whether
they follow proper scholarly procedures
and I am certain you will find a huge
number of cases where they don't if you
want to give you examples I can we're
people publish respected people
distinguished professors publish what
they know to be outright lies
fabrication for the purpose of
defamation for the purpose of state
worship and so on this case after case
about this
I mean I've actually published some of
them most of my own father with Debenham
like to explore these gutters but if
anyone wants to carry out than that you
see from external forces I don't frankly
know what he said about 911 and I don't
care
but there's plenty of but statements
that are controversial are all over the
place I mean open any newspaper any
scholarly article take any topic you
want take 14 picks aid cups the most
covered topic in the last 40 years war
in Vietnam the statements that are made
about that a hundred percent of the time
close to that are not only controversial
but how aegis for example tried I was
just reading Foreign Affairs last night
little air it was his version of the
word
anything wrong he takes the conventional
framework of the US air beam to defend
South Vietnam from North Vietnamese
aggression every one of those statements
is an outright lie
of the United States invaded to attack
South Vietnam before the North
Vietnamese were ever even significantly
involved the United States is
practically wiped out South Vietnam
furthermore that can be demonstrated
from their own sources but can I say
that what you have to say is lies and
deception of a kind that we would regard
as utterly outrageous if they appeared
in the old Soviet Union we can start
from there you want to go on yeah their
country their statements they're lying
controversial but I will hand it I'm
spinning topic you why do we investigate
them to investigate the whole faculty
for them no that's not the way to deal
with way to deal with just how you want
to run through the idea
it all takes those name premises I just
happened to be reading this all right
well I would like to go more into the
issues of academic freedom after Penn
station.i my trip but a lot that never a
special area of protecting the rights of
people who were probably outside of most
people's comfort zone including probably
especially in academia itself just
skipping over the questions you've
already answered I would like to ask
something of you first in terms of the
Jewish reference you find any mention
that you didn't really choose to follow
this speech but it has been brought up
time and time again there's an insurance
issue the 911s a thing broke but one
thing that has actually caused quite a
bit of controversy was the comparison of
the people involved in financial
business in the World Trade Center of
the coolant of a Nazi officer Adolf
Eichmann the term technocrats was so I
have an attorney little activist was
thrown out I'm not sure how familiar may
be with
oh hello I would like to ask you about
the comparison of makes in saying that
these people who live likeness because
even though they one who wants to
anything they knew about the directions
would cause mass cons of a third world
from imperialism but they show us not to
act my questions based on this
information do you think that's an actor
fairly plausible and I think standard
picture of the pipeline is Hana event
nobody thought she was a Nazi he stated
her picture of Eichmann was that he was
a technocratic didn't really pay much
attention he was doing the phrase the
banality of evil comes from that so if
that's what - was doing a tactic
rattling things around without paying
attention and a little Iceland would be
a minor variant of that who's also
pushing papers around and not paying
attention to what he's doing it's not a
comparison I would make but certainly
not outrageous compares some of your
troops
Vanetta that is they're sure about
banality people could though another
argument be made applause Laurie it's
not just finale because there has to
come a awareness about Karen but I think
whether you've also written a lot of a
center how many people choose to make
themselves not aware of the events that
do happen around the world from US
policy so does that sort of qualifies
finality or is that more in terms of
ignorance or is the ordinary person on
the streets probably I mean if you're
flooded with massive reporting like
education scholarly literature if you
read it which says for example that the
u.s. was defending South Vietnam people
believed in you know unless you really
search so that's ignorant
if we're talking about people who have
better access to information it shades
off into the seat I mean take any one
acquainted enough Vietnam to have
actually looked at the Pentagon Papers
did work to have read and burn up full
food like everybody's say the Pentagon's
position is that he's the one civilian
specialists who has to be taken
seriously it's the only person he's only
non government person even a mentioned
in McNamara's no more and he's
understood his clock and he was
understood to be the leading military
historian and Vietnam specialist and
hawkish in 1967 he wrote that Vietnam is
one of the quote as a cultural and
historical entity is likely to become
extinct under the attack of the most
horrendous military assault that's ever
happened
modern times you're still that South
Vietnam so how you defend South Vietnam
by destroying it to the point where it
might become extinct according to the
leading specialist who happens to be a
hawk well anybody who's read at least
that far and this is the major scholar
and knows the background and then says
we were defending itself Vietnam well at
this point we're moving beyond finality
and that's pretty close to line if
there's no scholar
