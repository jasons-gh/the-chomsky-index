you know there's no economic principle
that says that management should be
responsive to shareholders in fact you
can read and you know texts of business
economics that well you could just as
well have a system in which the
management is responsible to
stakeholders you know stakeholders
meaning workers and community why not
why shouldn't they be responsible of
course this presupposes that there
oughta be management but that's another
question
Why should there be management why not
have the stakeholders run the industry
well this is a phenomenon that's growing
I'm following it I know that you are
Gaara Perewitz is written about it
worker coops appearing across Ohio
Pennsylvania right here where we are now
one question that I hear is will change
come from changing ownership even to
worker ownership if you don't change the
profit paradigm could you maintain the
same kind of exploitative profit system
under worker ownership it's a little bit
like asking whether shareholder voting
is a good idea yeah it's a step is the
Buffett Rule a good idea you know a
small step I mean worker ownership
within a state capitalist market semi
market system is better than private
ownership but it has inherent problems
I mean markets have well-known inherent
inefficiencies this is part of markets
they're very destructive I mean the
obvious one is that a in a market system
a really functioning one whoever's
making the decisions doesn't pay
attention to what are called
externalities effects on others so say I
sell you a car we where our eyes are
open we'll make a good deal for it for
ourselves but we're not asking Westmont
how it's gonna affect her and it will
will be more congestion more gas price
will go up environmental effects and so
on and that multiplies over the whole
population well that's pretty serious
that takes a financial price
ever since New Deal regulation was
essentially dismantled they've been
regular financial crises and one of the
fundamental reasons it's understood is
the fact that there's a CEO of Goldman
Sachs or C group or whatever does not
pay attention to what's called systemic
risk so maybe you make a risky
investment transaction and you cover
your own potential losses but you don't
take into account the fact that if it
crashes it may crash the system which is
what a financial crash is so and the
much more serious case of this is the
fact is environmental effect now there
in the case of financial institutions
when they crash you can come the tax
payer comes to the rescue but if you
destroy the environment nobody's going
to come to the rescue
so sounds like you'd support things like
the Cleveland model where the ownership
of the company is actually held by a NGO
representing the community as well as
workers that's a step forward but it
also has to go beyond that to dismantle
the system of production for profit
rather than production for use and that
means you know dismantling at least
large parts of market systems take the
most advanced case Mondragon it it's
worker-owned it's it's not worker
managed actually although the management
does come from the workforce often they
exploit workers and some South America
you know they they do things that are
harmful to the societies old and so on
and have no choice I mean if you're in a
system where you must make profit in
order to survive you're compelled to
ignore negative externalities effects on
others that's only one example the
market systems also have a very bad just
kind of psychological effect they drive
people to a conception of themselves and
society in which your your f your only
if after your own good you know
others and that's extremely harmful have
you ever felt tasted had a sense of a
non-market system have you ever had a
flash of optimism oh this is how we
could live so it certainly can be done
and I the biggest I know is mandra gun
but there many in between I'm in a
functioning family for example and there
are bigger groups you know cooperatives
or case in point right here in Boston
there's one of the suburbs was about two
years ago I guess there was a small but
profitable enterprise building some kind
of high-tech equipment for airplanes or
something
the multinational who owned it didn't
want to keep it on the books it was
profitable over father's so they decided
to close it down the workforce and the
union is ue offered to buy it
the community was supportive it could
have worked if there had been popular
support if there had been an Occupy
movement then I think that would have
been a great thing for them to
concentrate on if it had worked you
would have had one of there are many of
them a profitable worker on maybe worker
management enterprises there's a fair
amount of that around the country and
there are real examples I don't see why
they shouldn't survive of course they're
going to be beaten back you know the
power systems are not going to want any
more than they want popular democracy
any more than the states in the Middle
East and the West they're going to
tolerate the Arab Spring they're gonna
try to beat it back they tried to beat
back those sit-in strikes that you
talked about early on what we forget is
entire communities showed up to support
those workers getting food in there make
sure they were protected including women
as I recall big gordon's of women
protecting them from the cops go back a
century to homestead
you know there's worker run communities
towns that send in the
garden destroy them
