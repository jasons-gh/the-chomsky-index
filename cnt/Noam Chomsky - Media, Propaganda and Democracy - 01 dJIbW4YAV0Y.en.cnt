professor Noam Chomsky an introduction
the issues that I would like to discuss
in these lectures are rooted in the
nature of Western industrial societies
in these capitalist democracies there's
a certain tension perhaps even a
contradiction with regard to where power
is located in a democracy the people
rule at least in principle but
decision-making power over large areas
of social life resides in private hands
and that has a major spillover effect
throughout the social order when we
resolve the tension would be to extend
the democratic system to investment
organization of work and so on that
would be a major social revolution which
in my view at least would realize some
of the libertarian principles on which
the political revolutions of the 18th
century were partially founded or the
attention could be resolved and
sometimes is by eliminating public
interference with state and private
power in advanced industrial societies
the problem is typically approached by a
more moderate means by measures to
deprive democratic political structures
of substantive content while leaving is
finally intact a large part of this task
is assumed by audiological institutions
they have the job of channeling thought
and attitudes within acceptable bounds
deflecting any potential challenge to
establish privilege and authority before
it can take form and gather strength
this enterprise has many facets and
agents here I'm going to be primarily
concerned with one aspect thought
control as conducted through the agency
of the national media and related
elements of the elite intellectual
culture i'll be speaking primarily of
the United States which I know best but
i think that the comments generalized
reasonably well to other industrial
societies as well in napping and there's
much to link
to these matters my feeling is that
citizens of the democratic societies
should undertake a course of what we
would call intellectual self-defense to
protect themselves from manipulation and
control and to lay the basis for more
meaningful democracy it's this concern
that motivates my comments here on ideas
the 1988 Massie lectures about media
propaganda and democracy a series of
five talks one each night this week
divided into 16 sections including
questions from a panel of distinguished
Canadian journalists the Mensa lectures
are an annual event on CBC Radio there
began in nineteen sixty one and the
featured leading figures in literature
and politics religion and the arts
including Northrop Frye Jane Jacobs car
was for this paul goodman claude
levi-strauss CB mcpherson martin luther
king jr. and doris lessing the 1988
messy lectures are given by Noam Chomsky
institute professor in the departments
of philosophy linguistics the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Boston professor Chomsky is an
internationally renowned scholar the
leading theorists in the field of
structural linguistics and the author of
some thirty books both technical books
in the field of linguistics and books
addressed to a general audience which
examined political issues focusing
especially on the place of the United
States and international affairs he is
particularly concerned with what
Americans find out through their mass
media more properly called professor
Chomsky's view the elite media his
approach to this question involves a
massive amount of research his books are
noted for the mountain of data that
contained in September 1988 his latest
book co-authored with professor Edward
Herrmann was published by pantheon it's
called manufacturing consent some of the
raw material for the conclusions he
draws in these messy lectures can be
found in that book which is in
bookstores and libraries now throughout
his work professor Chomsky is based his
conclusions on a closer analysis of
cific cases but his real interest is in
the larger issues that the specific
cases point to what are the enduring
institutional characteristics of our
media system the system we call the Free
Press and how do those characteristics
affect what we think we know a half
century ago John Dewey observed that
criticism of specific abuses has only
limited value the only really
fundamental approach to the problem
Julie said is to inquire concerning a
necessary effect of the present economic
system upon the whole system of what he
called publicity upon the judgement of
what news is upon the selection and
elimination of matter that is published
upon the treatment of news in both news
and editorial columns the question under
this mode of approach is not how many
specific abuses there are and how they
may be remedied but how far a genuine
intellectual freedom and social
responsibility are possible on any large
scale under the existing economic regime
the philosopher and theologian Reinhold
Niebuhr concluded that ordinary people
were hardly capable of understanding the
world or drawing reasonable conclusions
without being subjected to a set of what
he called necessary illusions what we
called propaganda constructed by the
intellectual elites the system for
managing this has turned out with the
mass media the title of the 1988 Massey
lectures is necessary illusions Noam
Chomsky I let me begin with a report in
a church-based Latin American Journal
declined San Paulo Brazil the headline
reads Brazilian bishops support plan to
democratize media the report describes a
proposal which is now being debated in
the
constituent assembly that would open up
reserves powerful and highly
concentrated media to citizen
participation Brazil's Catholic Bishops
are among the principal advocates of
this legislative proposal to democratize
the country's communications media the
report points out that Brazilian TV is
in the hands of five big networks while
eat huge multinational corporations and
some state enterprises attempt for most
communications advertising the current
proposal calls for a national
communications Council that would be
made up of civilian and government
representatives and would develop a
democratic communications policy the
questions raised by the Brazilian
bishops are being seriously discussed in
many parts of the world their project
underway and several Latin American
countries and elsewhere as well there
has been discussion of what's been
called a new world information order the
idea is to diversify media access to
encourage alternatives to the global
media system which is under the
overwhelming dominance of the Western
industrial powers a inquiry into such
possibilities by UNESCO elicited an
extremely hostile reaction in the United
States and contributed to the near the
millions of the organization the alleged
concern was freedom of the press one
question I'd like to raise in these
lectures is just how serious this
concern is and what in fact it comes
through what's its substantive content
further questions that why in the
background have to do with what a
democratic communications policy would
be and whether it's a good idea and if
so whether it's an attainable concept
and more generally just what kind of
democratic order is it to which we
aspire the concept of democratizing the
media has
real meaning within the terms of
political discourse in the United States
in fact the phrase has a paradoxical or
even vaguely subversive ring to it
citizen participation would be
considered an infringement on freedom of
the press it would be considered a boil
struck against the independence of the
media that would distort the mission
that they have undertaken to inform the
public without fear or favor not
reaction nerds and thought delaying it
our beliefs as to how the media do
function and also as to how they should
function within our democratic systems
there are also certain implicit
conceptions of the nature of democracy
let's have a look at these topics in
turn the standard image of media
performance was expressed by judge girth
nine in a decision in which he rejected
efforts by the US government to borrow
publication of the Pentagon Papers you
need decision he said that we have a
cantankerous press an obstinate press a
ubiquitous press and it must be suffered
by there is an authority in order to
preserve the even greater values of
freedom of expression and the right of
the people to know kindness anthony
lewis of the new york times turning it
on this decision and pointed out that
the media when were always as
independent vigilant and defiant of
authority as they are today but he says
in the Vietnam and Watergate heroes the
media learned to exercise the power to
read about international life exposing
what they deem right for exposure
without regard to external pressures
that too is a commonly held belief there
has been much debate about the media
during this period but it does need deal
with the problem of democratizing media
and freeing them from the constraints of
state and private power whether the
issue that is debated is whether the
media have not exceeded proper bounds
and escaping such constraints the
question is whether they have perhaps
even threatening the existence of
democratic institutions and their
contentious and irresponsible defiance
of authority there was
important study on these topics by the
trilateral commission in 1975 it was a
study on what they called governability
of democracies and the Commission which
is made up of elite elements from Japan
of the United States and Europe the
Commission concluded that the media have
become unreadable new source of national
power this they said is we inspect of an
excess of democracy that contributes to
the reduction of governmental authority
at home and a consequent decline in the
influence of democracy abroad this
general crisis of democracy the
Commission held results from the efforts
of previously marginalized sectors of
the population to organize and to press
their demands by doing so they create an
overload that prevents the democratic
process from functioning properly the
American commentator Samuel Huntington a
professor at Harvard University and
without that in earlier times President
Truman have been able to govern the
country with the cooperation of a
relatively small member of wall street
lawyers and bankers in this period then
there was no crisis of democracy but in
the 1960s the crisis developed enraged
serious proportions the trilateral
commission study therefore urges more
motivation and democracy to mitigate
what they call the excess of democracy
and thus overcome the crisis but in
plain terms the junior public must be
reduced to their traditional apathy and
obedience and driven from the arena of
political debate and action if democracy
is to survive this study reflects the
perceptions and values of liberal elites
from the United States Europe and Japan
it includes the meaning figures of the
carter administration President Carter
himself in fact in the right the
perception is that democracy is
threatened by the organizing efforts of
those groups that are called the special
interests that's an interesting concept
of contemporary political rhetoric it
the workers farmers women use the
elderly the handicapped ethnic
minorities in fact to the general
population in the u.s. presidential
campaigns of the 1980s the Democrats
were accused of being the instrument of
these special interests and therefore
undermining the national interest what
is the national interest well the tacit
assumption is that the national interest
is represented by the way notable sector
that was emitted from the list of
special interests corporations financial
institution is another business elites
they represent the national interest the
charge that the Democrats represent the
special interests has little merit well
they they represent other elements of
the national interest and they
participated with few qualms in the
so-called great turn of the post-vietnam
yura among elite groups this white turn
had a new way of different aspects did
included the dismantling of the limited
state programs that were designed to
protect the poor and deprived the
transfer of resources to the wealthy the
conversion of the state even more than
before into a welfare state for the
privileged and the expansion of state
power and the protected state sector of
the economy through the military system
the military system domestically in the
United States is in fact a device for
compelling the public to subsidize high
technology industry and to provide a
state guaranteed market for high
technology waste production a related
element of the right turn was a more
activist foreign policy the goal was to
extend us power through subversion
international terrorism and aggression
what's called the Reagan doctrine which
the media characterizes the vigorous
defense of democracy worldwide in
general the Democratic opposition
offered qualified support to these
programs of the Reagan administration
and effectively is that they were
largely an extrapolation of initiatives
of the cutter years and with very few
exceptions were strongly opposed by the
general population and that's a fact
that way
clearly shown by polling results during
this period we should not be misled by
Reagan's landslide electoral victories
in fact Reagan win the votes of under a
third of the electorate and of the
voters a clear majority hoped that his
legislative programs would not be
enacted I mean while half the population
continue to hold that the government is
ruined by a few big interests looking
out for themselves as polls regularly
show the Reagan phenomenon in fact may
offer a kind of foretaste of well
capitalist democracies are moving in
general with a number of crucial
features the elimination of labor unions
of independent media of political
associations and marginally the
elimination of forms of popular
organization that interfere with
nomination of the state by concentrated
private power well let's return to the
media which are charged with having fan
the ominous flames of excess of
democracy the trilateral commission
concludes I'm now quoting them that
broader interests of society and
government required that if jurists do
need impose standards of professionalism
upon themselves then the alternative
could well be regulation by the
government to the end of restoring a
balance between government and media
others have had similar concerns the
executive director of Freedom House
Leonard Sussman asks the question must
say institutions be overthrown because
of the very freedom they sustain he too
was referring to the allegedly
adversarial behavior of the media John
Roach who's the intellectual and
residents during the James and
administration he answers Sussman's
question by calling for congressional
investigation of the workings of these
private governments who he cleans
distorted the record so grossly in their
anti Johnson mission however he fears
that Congress is too terrified of the
media to undertake this urgent task a
both Sussman and roach are committing
only two volumes doubled
of media coverage of the Tet Offensive
of 1968 sponsored by fooling house
written by Peter breaststroke journalist
this study has been widely held as a
legal contribution during which
described it as one of the major pieces
of investigative reporting in first-rate
scholarship of the past quarter century
he calls it a meticulous case study of
media incompetents if not malevolence
this classic of Marian scholarship is
alleged to have demonstrated that in
your incompetent and biased coverage
reflecting the adversary culture of the
60s the media lost the war in Vietnam
they therefore home the cause of
democracy and freedom for which the
United States fought in vain this
Freedom House study concludes that these
failures reflect the more volatile
journalistic style that has become so
popular since the late 1960s and they
are going to say that it is accompanied
with an often realest readiness to seek
out conflict to believe the worst of the
government or of authority in general
and on that basis to divide up the
actors on any issue into the good in the
bed where the bad actors include the US
forces in Vietnam the
military-industrial complex the CIA and
the US government jia li and the good in
the eyes of the media are presumably the
Communists who were consistently over
crazed and protected so the Freedom
House study claims there is in fact us
striking an interesting aspect of
reporting the Tet Offensive up until the
Tet Offensive the media had typically
recorded the war as the American command
wanted them to see it journalists were
taken on guided towards they were very
few that did anything different from
that and they presented the war as
perceived under the control of the
American military but during the Tet
Offensive that didn't work the war was
all around them they could look out the
windows are there hotels and see
fighting and they saw that it was a very
more than the one that they had been
programs have present in that respect
coverage of the Tet Offensive was
different but only in that respect it's
by me an established truth that it's my
most inescapable that such broad
coverage will continue in support for
the war effort particularly the often
glory pictorial reportage by television
I am quoting from Landrum balling who is
speaking in a conference that he
directed on the media the conference was
devoted to the question of whether there
is indeed no way to effect some kind of
balance between the advantages of
totalitarian government enjoys because
of its ability to control or blackout
unfavorable news and warfare and the
disadvantages for the free society of
allowing open coverage of all the
wartime events the Watergate affair in
which investigative reporting helped
force the president from office as
Anthony Lewis points out that reinforced
these dire images of impending
destruction of democracy by the
freewheeling independent and head versus
aerial media the iran-contra scandal are
contributed to these images two kinds of
questions arise in connection with these
vigorous debates about the media and
democracy the first are questions of
fact the second are questions of value
the basic question of fact is whether
the media have indeed adopted an
adversarial stance perhaps with
excessive zeal whether in particular
they under being the defense of freedom
and we're team and threaten free
institutions by flagellating ourselves
and those in power if that turns out to
be true as a matter of fact we made in
ask a further question would it be
proper to impose some external
constraints to ensure that the media
keep to the bones of responsibility now
the question of fact which is of course
fundamental is really argued the case is
assumed to have been proven they are
Stephen however who have argued that the
factual premises are simply forced let's
begin with the broadest claims let's
have a look at
the functioning of the so-called free
market of ideas there's an interesting
study by benjamin ginsberg of the
mobilization of popular opinion to
promote state power and after reviewing
many features of this he concludes that
now quoting Ginsburg he concludes that
the marketplace of ideas built during
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
effectively disengage the beliefs and
ideas of the upper classes while
subverting the ideological and cultural
independence of the lower classes
through the construction of this
marketplace western governments forged
firm and enduring links between
socioeconomic position and ideological
power they therefore permitted upper
classes to use each to buttress the
other in the United States in particular
the ability of the upper and middle
classes to dominate the marketplace of
ideas has jr. a allowed bay strata to
shape the entire society's perception of
political reality and the range of
realistic political and social
possibilities why Westerners usually
equate the marketplace with freedom of
opinion the hidden hand of the market
can be almost as potent an instrument of
control as the own fist of the state now
these conclusions have same initial
plausibility unguided free market
assumptions that are not particularly
controversial segments of the media that
can reach a substantial audience or
major corporations closely integrated
with even larger conglomerates what
other businesses they sell a product to
buyers the market to which they sell is
advertisers and the product is audiences
with a bias towards more wealthy
audiences which improve advertising
rates so in effect the media are major
corporation selling privileged audiences
to other businesses it would hardly come
as a surprise if the picture of the
world they present where to reflect the
perspectives and the interests of the
sellers the buyers and the product
furthermore those who occupy the
managerial positions in the media or
gain status within the next
imitators belong to the same privileged
elites and it would be reasonable to
expect that they would share the
perceptions aspirations and attitudes of
their associates these reflect their own
class interests as well journalists
enjoying the system and likely to make
their way unless they can claim to these
ideological pressures generally they
conform by internalizing the values it's
an easy to say one thing and believe in
other and those who fail to confirm will
tend to be weeded out by familiar
mechanisms there are many other factors
that induce the media to conform to the
requirements of the state corporate
Nexus to confront power is costly and
difficult high standards of evidence and
argument are imposed and critical
analysis will naturally not be welcomed
by those who are in a position to react
rigorously and to determine the array of
rewards and punishments conformity to a
patriotic agenda in contrast imposes no
such costs charges against official
enemies barely require substantiation
they are also protected from correction
our correction can always be dismissed
as apologetics for the criminals
assuming who will tributes the best
intentions to the United States while
perhaps deploying failure and ineptitude
requires new evidence for this stance so
for example new evidence is required
when we ask why success has continued to
elude us in the third world why Cannot a
nation of such vast wealth power and
good intentions accomplish its purposes
more promptly and more effectively not
again quoting landrum balling who needs
no evidence to condemn the Soviet Union
for aggression in Afghanistan and for
support of repression in Poland it's
quite a different matter when it in
turns to us aggression indochina well
its efforts to prevent the political
settlement of the arab-israeli conflict
over many years oh this is readily
documented but it's unwelcome
and therefore a known fact no argument
is demanded for a kind of nation of Iran
or Libya for state supported terrorism
discussion of the permanent arguably the
dominant role of the United States and
its clients in organizing and conducting
this plate of the matter near that
elicits only higher and contempt and
evidence however compelling is dismissed
as irrelevant as a matter of course the
media and the intellectual chance either
praise the United States for dedicating
itself to the struggle for democracy in
Nicaragua where they criticize it for
the means that is employed to pursue
this laudable objective a challenge to
the underlying patriotic assumption is
virtually unthinkable within the
mainstream and with such a challenge
were permitted expression it would be
dismissed as a variety of ideological
fanaticism and absurdity even if it were
backed by overwhelming evidence not a
very difficult task in this case case by
case within that conformity is the easy
way it's a path to privilege and
prestige dissidents carries personal
costs these costs may be severe even in
a society that lacks such means of
control as death squads psychiatric
prisons or extermination camps the very
structure of the media is designed to
induce conformity to establish doctrine
in a three minute stretch between
commercials or in 700 words it's
impossible to present them familiar
thoughts or surprising conclusions with
the argument in the evidence that's
needed to give them some credibility on
ideas you're listening to the 1988 messy
lectures by Noam Chomsky chapter two a
propaganda model of the media it's a
mutual expectation that the major media
will reflect the perspectives and the
interests of established power these
expectations in fact are amply fulfilled
that has been argued by a new
analysts my co-author Edward Herrmann I
have published extensive documentation
and joint work and separately to support
a conception of how the media function
with the first quite sharply from the
standard version what we call a
propaganda model of the media according
to this property in the model the media
serve the interests of state and
corporate power which are closely
interlinked the media frame their
reporting an analysis in a manner that
supports established privilege and that
limits debate and discussion accordingly
to subject the model to a fair test with
selected examples that are as closely
paired as history allows claims
attributable to official enemies versus
those for which we and our clients bear
responsibility good deeds for example
elections conducted by official enemies
versus those in u.s. clannad states
there are literally thousands of pages
of documentation supporting the
conclusions of the propaganda model by
the standards of the social sciences
it's very well confirmed if there is a
serious change to this conclusion
unaware of it the highly regarded
Freedom House study what I mentioned
before which is held to have
demonstrated the adversarial character
of the media and what study collapses
upon analysis it contains innumerable
errors and misrepresentations even
classification of its own documentation
we know of this is corrected little
remains beyond a complaint that the
media were too pessimistic in their
pursuit of the righteous cause I know of
no other studies that fare any better so
to summarize we have two models of the
media there's a sort of standard model
which is that the media are adversarial
cantankerous obstreperous that they
confront state and private power and
then there's a debate over whether they
do this to excessively that's the
standard model going to the propaganda
model very much the opposite is true the
media are docile submissive and they
serve the interests of state and
corporate power those are the two models
and as I've suggested the propaganda
model
has very extensive documentation to back
it will be giving some examples as I
proceed now there are to be sure other
factors that influence the performance
of social institutions as complex as the
media and when can find exceptions to
the predictions of the propaganda model
nevertheless the propaganda model I
believe has been shown to provide a very
good first approximation which captures
essential properties of the media and in
fact essential properties of the
dominant intellectual culture more
generally journalists often need a high
standard of professionalism in their
work they exhibit courage integrity and
enterprise and this includes many of
those who report for me do that adhere
closely to the predictions of the
propaganda model there is no
contradiction here what is at issue is
yet the ebc of the opinions expressed
where the integrity of those who seek
the facts rather what is at issue is the
choice of topics the range of opinion
permitted expression the unquestioned
premises and the general framework
that's imposed for the presentation of a
certain view of the world now I really
given you know of examples to illustrate
the workings of the propaganda model but
in these lectures I want to rely on the
ample material it's in print to
establish the basic case this work has
elicited much outrage right to parade
and falsification but to my knowledge
there is no serious effort to respond to
the critique rather such critiques are
simply dismissed notice again that this
is in conformity to the predictions of
the propaganda model typically debate
over media performance within the
mainstream includes critics of the
adversarial stance of the media and
responses by people who defend the media
but such debate excludes in a critique
of the media for
to the predictions of the propaganda
model it even excludes any recognition
that this might be a conceivable
position the middle of do cheerfully
publish condemnations of their quote
breathtaking lack of balance or even the
appearance of fair-mindedness and the
ills and dangers of today's wayward
press charges of this nature are often
not unwelcome by the media the first
reason is that response is simple or
even superfluous and the second reason
is that debate over this issue helps
entrench the belief that the media are
either independent and objective with
high standards of professional integrity
and openness to all reasonable views or
alternatively that they are biased
towards stylish ly leftish flouting of
authority your conclusion is quite
acceptable to established power and
privilege even media elites themselves
are not averse to the charge that they
may have gone too far in pursuing their
cantankerous and obstreperous ways in
defiance of Orthodoxy in power the
spectrum of discussion reflects exactly
what a propaganda model will predict
condemnation of liberal bias and defense
against this charge but no recognition
of the possibility that liberal bias
might simply be an expression of winged
variant of the narrow state corporate
ideology as quite demonstrably it is now
let me return to the proposals of the
Brazilian bishops concerning
democratization of the media one reason
why they will appear superfluous or when
headed if raised in our political
context is that the media are assumed to
be dedicated to service to the public
good possibly into extreme and their
independence of authority the assumption
is that the media are performing their
proper social role a role that was
explained by Supreme Court justice
Powell Powell stated new individual can
obtain for himself the information
needed for the intelligent discharge of
his political responsibilities by
enabling
public to assert meaningful control over
the political process the press performs
a crucial function in affecting the
societal purpose of the first amendment
to the US constitution which guarantees
freedom of press there is an alternative
conception which i believe is valid and
that is that the media are indeed
serving a societal purpose but quite a
different one they are serving the
purpose those also served by state
education as conceived by James mill in
the early days of the establishment of
this system that is to quote training
names of the people to a virtuous
attachment to their government and more
generally to the arrangements of the
social economic and political order far
from contributing to a crisis of
democracy of a sort that's feared by the
liberal establishment the media are
vigilant Guardians protecting privilege
from the threat of public understanding
and participation the 1998 CBC meza
lectures continue on ideas presented by
Noam Chomsky chapter 3 democracy and the
engineering of consent our political
culture has a different conception of
democracy from that of the Brazilian
bishops for the Brazilian bishops
democracy means that citizens should
have the opportunity to inform
themselves to take part in inquiry in
discussion in policy formation and to
advance their programs through a
political action for us democracy is
much more narrowly conceived the citizen
is a consumer an observer not a
participant the public has the right to
ratify policies that originated
elsewhere that if these limits are
exceeded we have not democracy but a
crisis of democracy that must somehow be
resolved this concept is based on
doctrines that were laid down by the
founding fathers of American democracy
historian Joyce Appleby observes that
I'm quoting her that the the Federalists
that the new American political
institutions would continue to function
within the old assumptions about a
politically active a lead and a
differential compliant electorate The
Federalist conception / well despite
their electoral defeat it was expressed
lucidly by John Jay the president of the
Continental Congress and the first Chief
Justice of the US Supreme Court Jay said
the people who earn the country ought to
government by the people constitutional
historian richard nas observes he meant
a small national estate whom he was too
cautious to name that a lead consisted
of the white property nails for whom the
constitutional order was established the
vast exodus of loyalists and blacks to
Canada and elsewhere reflected in part
their insight into these realities Jay
and his associates were convinced that
as they could if the people are well
prepared for the government to assume
that power without which government is
but a name and such few as are the
different opinion may easily be
convinced of their mistake by that
powerful argument a halter so one
associate of Jay is wrote in 1783 John J
is Maxim that those who in the country
ought to government that is in fact the
principle on which the Republic was
founded and maintained and then its very
nature capitalist democracy cannot
stroll very far from this pattern at
home that means that politics should
reduce an effect to interactions among
groups of investors who compete for
control of the state this conception is
what political scientist James Ferguson
calls the investment theory of politics
and he argues I think very plausibly
that it explains a large part of US
political history for our dependencies
the same basic principle entails that
democracy is achieved when the society
is under the control of local
barkis business-based elements linked to
us investors the military under our
control and professionals who can be
trusted to follow orders and serve the
interests of us power and privilege if
there is any popular change to the rule
of these elements then we are entitled
to resort to violence to restore
democracy I use your the term that's
conventionally employed by the media and
reference to the way in doctrine in
Nicaragua where we are restoring
democracy in reference to the third
world the media contrast the Democrats
with the Communists the Democrats are
those who save the interests of us power
the Communists are those afflicted with
a disease that's called ultra
nationalism in top secret US government
planning documents such as those of the
National Security Council going back for
many decades these documents explain
very forthrightly that the threat to us
interests is nationalistic regimes that
respond to domestic pressures for
improvement of living standards and for
social reform regimes that have
insufficient regard for the needs of us
investors the middie of any following
the rules are game when they contrast
the fledgling democracies of Central
America which are under military and
business control with communist
Nicaragua and one can easily appreciate
why the media suppress the 1987 polls in
El Salvador that revealed that a mere
ten percent of the population believes
that there is a process of democracy and
freedom in the country at present the
point is that the belated Salvadorans
doubtless fail to comprehend the
American concept of democracy in
accordance with these conceptions
there's no infringement on democracy if
a few corporations control the
information system in fact that is the
essence of democracy in the earnings of
the American Academy of political and
social science prestigious us journal
the leading figure of the public
relations industry Edward Bernays
explained back in the 1940s that the
very essence of the democratic
process is the freedom to persuade and
suggest what he calls the engineering of
consent he goes on to say a leader
frequently cannot wait for the people to
arrive at even general understanding
Democratic leaders must play their part
in engineering consent to socially
constructive goals and values they must
apply scientific principles and trade
practices to the task of getting people
to support ideas and programs he doesn't
say this but it's understood that
business will judge what is socially
constructive and business will engineer
consent through the media and implement
policy through the state authorities if
the freedom to persuade happens to be
concentrated in a few hands as it
obviously is we must recognize that
that's the nature of a free society
similar ideas are standard across the
political spectrum the deal of us
journalists walter Lippmann observe that
what he called the manufacture of
consent has become quote a
self-conscious art and a regular organ
of popular government he felt that this
was quite appropriate because in his
words the common interests very largely
elude public opinion entirely and can be
managed only by a specialized class
whose personal interests reach beyond a
locality Lippmann was writing shortly
after World War one at that time the
liberal intellectual community was much
impressed with their success and serving
as quote the faithful and helpful
interpreters of what seems to be one of
the greatest enterprises ever undertaken
by an American president the enterprise
was Woodrow Wilson's interpretation of
his electoral mandate for peace without
victory as the occasion for pursuing
victory without peace even as he was
assisted by the liberal intellectuals
who later praised themselves in their
words for heading in
is there will upon a reluctant or
indifferent majority 15 years later in
nineteen thirty three political
scientist Howard last well explained in
an article in the encyclopedia of Social
Sciences that we should not succumb to
what he called Democratic dogmatism
about men being the best judges of their
own interests they are not the best
judges are the elites who must therefore
be ensured the names to impose their
will for the common good when social
arrangements demanding the required
force to compel obedience it's necessary
to turn to what last war called a whole
new technique of control largely through
propaganda because of the ignorance and
superstition of the masses in the same
years the much respected nihilist
Reinhold Niebuhr argued that rationality
belongs to the coil observers while the
proletarian fellows not reasoning but
faith based upon a crucial element of
necessary illusion without such a lesion
you were held the ordinary person will
descend to inertia nebo was in in his
marxist phase and he urged that those
whom he addressed that is the cool
observers recognize the stupidity of the
average man and provide the emotionally
potent oversimplifications that are
required to keep the proton on course to
create a new society these basic
conceptions underwent very little change
as neighbor became what Richard will v
record the official establishment
theologian offering counsel to those who
face the responsibilities of power after
World War two as the ignorant public
reverted to their soft for pacifism at a
time when elites understood that we must
mobilize for renewed global conflict
historian Thomas Bay wrote that quote
because the masses are notoriously
short-sighted and generally cannot see
danger until it is at their throats our
statesmen are forced to deceive them
into an awareness
interests deception of the people may
become increasingly necessary unless we
are willing to give our leaders in
Washington for your hand moving to
another point on the political spectrum
the conservative contempt for democracy
is succinctly articulated by sir lewis
naymeer who writes that quote there is
no free will in the thinking and action
of the masses and rather than in the
revolution of the planets and the
migration of boards and in the plunging
of worlds of winnings into the sea only
a disaster could ensue therefore if the
masses are permitted to enter the arena
of decision-making in a meaningful way
across the political spectrum the fact
that the voice of the people is heard in
democratic societies is considered a
problem to be overcome the problem must
be overcome by ensuring somehow that the
public voice speaks the right words the
general conception is that leaders
control us not that we control them if
the population is out of control and
propaganda doesn't work then the state
is forced underground to clandestine
operations and secret Wars the scale of
covered operations is often quite a good
measure of popular dissidents that was
dramatically the case during the rating
period among this group of self-styled
conservatives the commitment to untrain
old executive power and the contempt for
democracy which unusual heights
accordingly so did the resort to
propagate the campaigns targeting the
media and the general population one
example was the establishment of the
State Department Office of latin
american public dependency which
conducted such projects as Operation
truth that was described by one high
government official as a huge
psychological operation of the kind of
military conduct to influence a
population in denied or enemy territory
the terms expressed lucidly the attitude
towards the errant public enemy
territory that must be
anchored and subdued sometimes the
domestic enemy is hard to subdue that
was happening by the late 1960s Lyndon
Johnson was never able to declare a
national mobilization to fight the
Vietnam War efficiently in the manner of
World War two which turned out to be
highly beneficial to the US economy
under the national mobilization Jensen
in contrast was forced to fight what was
called a gaze and better war with
deficit financing and he was forced to
do that in order to prevent an explosion
in enemy territory at home that was very
harmful to the American economy and
after the Tet Offensive business elites
generally concluded that the enterprise
should be liquidated as too costly it
was public dissidents and protests that
need it too costly that's a fact that
should be remembered by people who hope
to influence government policy in a leap
run democracies when regulates came into
office very pretty clearly intended to
undertake direct military intervention
in Central America in the Kennedy
Johnson style they assumed that the
domestic enemy had been tamed that was
the import of the februari 1981 white
paper to their very great surprise
however large-scale protests to raise
all through the country the
administration at that point turned to
illegal clandestine operations they were
driven underground by the domestic enemy
this in fact is the real meaning of the
iran-contra affair in the dependencies
when we turn to violence to restore
democracy at home more subtle means are
required the manufacture of consent
deceiving the stupid noises with
necessary illusions covered operations
while the media and Congress pretended
not to see until it all becomes too
obvious to be suppressed that point we
shift to the phase of damage control to
ensure the public attention is diverted
to
roselle as Patriots or personality
defects of leaders who have strayed from
our noble commitments the task of the
full press in such circumstances is to
take the preceding seriously and to
describe them as a tribute to the
soundness of our self correcting
institutions in tomorrow's lecture I
want to concentrate on the project of
containing the enemy where in fact there
are two enemies that have to be
contained one is the foreign enemy the
second are the residents of enemy
territory at home the domestic
population the 1988 CVC Mesa lectures
about media propaganda and democracy
presented by Noam Chomsky institute
professor in the departments of young
mystics and philosophy at the
massachusetts institute of technology
you can find an extended discussion of
Professor terms just propaganda model of
the media in a new book is written with
torfur Edward Herrmann called
manufacturing consent it's published by
pension and it's available now in
libraries and bookstores the messy
lectures produced for ideas by max allan
