the privatization does not mean you take
a public institution and give it to some
nice person it means you take a public
institution and give it to an
unaccountable tyranny
public institutions have many side
benefits for one thing they may
purposely run a loss they're not out for
profit they may purposely run at a loss
because of the side benefits so for
example if a public steel industry runs
at a loss it's providing cheap steel
through other industries maybe that's a
good thing public institutions can have
a counter cyclical property so that
means that they can maintain employment
in periods of recession which increases
demand which helps you get out of
recession private company can't do that
in the recession throughout the
workforce so you make money
