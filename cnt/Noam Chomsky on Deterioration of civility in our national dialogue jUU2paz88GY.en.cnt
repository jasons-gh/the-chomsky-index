I don't think civility has either
improved their decline that has been
very ugly
always remember I grew up in the 1930s
and I grew up in an environment of
violent anti-semitism with not on just
even in the United States let alone it
was going on in Europe in Germany that
was high highly uncivil and hideous in
its consequences there is lack of
civility today too but this is only one
of numerous examples which showed that
it's no word I don't think is anywhere
near as vicious and destructive as it
was in the past
racist outpourings didn't say mainly in
the south but not only there were of a
kind that would be not just not
tolerated by general opinion today
I don't think however that one should
legislate civility that's something that
has to if it's going to be significant
it's going to grow out of improved
understanding sympathy compassion
general a general improvement in the
civilized level of life that's the way
to improve civility not by imposing
codes or laws or police
