scholarship on hating well in both parts
of hispaniola the Wilsons intervention
left a bitter legacy in comparably worse
in Haiti and before our eyes right now
in vivid and horrifying detail it can
hardly escape notice that the
devastating catastrophe in Haiti in
January like many others is sharply
class-based the small Europeanized
wealthy elite some just European they
didn't emerge unscathed but the really
horrendous tragedy was in the miserable
urban slums to which people had fled
from the ruined countryside that
contrast which was sharp enough was
heightened by the impact of the
earthquake a few weeks later in Chile
was five hundred times the magnitude of
the haitian earthquake but with a
fraction of the toll of the haitian
catastrophe in part because of Chile's
solid building standards and the radical
difference in wealth quite generally now
there's no great secret as to how Haiti
became a global symbol of misery and
despair it was Francis richest colony
and the source of much of Francis wealth
and by 1789 it was producing 75 percent
of the world's sugar and it was the
world leader in production of cotton
which is kind of the oil of the early
Industrial Revolution and many other
valuable commodities well apart from its
human consequences the slave based
plantation society that was imposed by
French Imperial violet of violence
undermine the fragile ecology Haiti
didn't liberate itself at a terrible
cost in 1804 it established the first
free society
of free men in the hemisphere and it
struck fear into the hearts of the
civilized world particularly the slave
state nearby which refused even to
recognize Haiti until 1862 when the u.s.
also recognized Liberia and for the same
reason the emancipation declaration
raised concerns about how to rid
ourselves of inferior inferior people
and the reigning doctrine was transfer
them to where they belong that project
was actually abandoned a few years later
when new and even harsher modes of
slavery were introduced as a central
factor in the u.s. industrial revolution
and a chapter of American history that's
too little known well after by then the
US took over from France and the
travails of hating continued Wilson's
invasion was the most destructive blow
in particular Wilson's restoration of a
semi plantation economy imperiled
impelled further the flight of poor
peasants to urban slums that process was
accelerated sharply under Reagan in
cooperation with the World Bank again
following the most progressive policies
of the dictates of the most advanced
economic theory the idea was that they
were going to help Haiti pursue its
comparative advantage of work in
us-owned assembly plants under miserable
conditions mostly women stitching
baseballs and sewing clothes and they
should abandon agricultural production
to us agribusiness all very rational in
a further act of benevolence the US and
the 80s compelled Haiti patients to
destroy their domestic pigs hard
pigs solid base for the peasant economy
and they were to replace them with pigs
from Iowa that required lavish care that
far exceeded the resources of their new
Haitian owners another blow to the
economy the proclaimed goal was to turn
Haiti into the Taiwan of the Caribbean
now in the same years deprived of the
tutelage of us and World Bank experts
Taiwan followed the opposite course it
located labor intensive industry in the
rural areas to stimulate growth and
demand and to prevent migration to urban
areas and it succeeded brilliantly
Taiwan became Taiwan and Haiti sank
deeper into misery the final blow was
administered by Clinton after several
years of supporting brutal military
terror Clinton permitted the elected
president to return but on a condition
namely that he accept the policies of
the US candidate in the nineteen ninety
election who had been roundly defeated
by as a result of remarkable grassroots
organizing in the hills and the slums
again striking terror into the heart of
the Emperor Clinton's condition for
restoration of the rule of the vast
majority was that Haiti must not impose
any import duties once again in
compliance with the most advanced
economic theory the consequences were
predicted right away by US government
analysts
least studies showing that what remained
of Haitian agriculture would be
destroyed Haitian rice farmers are
efficient but they can't possibly
compete with the US agribusiness which
gains much of its profits from the
lavish government subsidies designed by
the free market enthusiasts of the
Reagan administration and as predicted a
haiti lost the capacity to feed itself
more peasant families fled to the
miserable urban slums where survivals
barely impossible under normal
conditions and there's no time to fill
in the remaining gaps but there more or
less the same the result the catastrophe
we're now witnessing but witnessing
without historical memory very crucial
in an imperial state without historical
memory or without recognition of what
our role in the catastrophe would lead
decent people to do and surely without
memory of the significant contribution
of wilsonian idealism well Wilson's
famed for his dedication to
self-government but as he explained it
had limits he said it did not apply to
people at a low level of civilization
who must be given friendly protection
guidance and assistance by the colonial
powers that had tended to their needs in
earlier days you look at his famous 14
points they held that in questions of
sovereignty quoting the interests of the
populations concerned must have equal
weight with the equitable claims of the
government whose title is to be
determined that is the colonial ruler
particularly needing our protection and
guidance were those whose resources we
want it by Wilson's day it was becoming
clear that oil would be the of prime
significant
for the military in the future economy
generally accordingly Wilson expelled
the British from Venezuela which by 1928
had become the world's leading oil
exporter with us companies now in charge
to achieve that goal will Washington
actively supported the vicious and venal
regime of 1 cent a gomez violating its
open door policy in order to achieve US
economic hegemony in Venezuela by
pressuring its government to bar British
concessions quoting the standard
scholarly study by Stephen raid at home
Wilson's idealism took the form of a Red
Scare that was the worst attack on
elementary civil rights in American
history now it might be thought that the
historical record would pose some
problems for the imagery of benevolent
exceptionalism that's diligently
constructed within the culture of
imperialism but it as among the current
Emperor's predecessors this is hardly so
it's it's kind of interesting to see how
Wilson scholarship deals with this
dilemma the fields too vast even try to
sample seriously but you get some of the
flavor of it from the current issue of
the leading british international
affairs journal called international
affairs it features several just came
out a couple weeks ago features several
scholarly articles on the Wilsonian
heritage in American foreign policy now
the method adopted in these studies or
quote is a close examination of how a
close examination of how the various
ideas bundled together within the
concept of wilsonian ISM emerged in
Wilson's own statements and there
follows a sophisticated analysis of
Wilson's statements as they varied in
reaction to changing circumstances and
of how the ideological version of
wilsonian ism has been invoked to
justify actions in later years and there
are a couple of illustrations one of
them is the work of political scientist
Tony Smith on what he calls America's
mission exalting Reagan as the most
wilsonian of all presidents since
Wilson's time another example is the
resort to democracy promotion as the
rationale for us Middle East policy
under george w bush the scholarly
inquiry omits to observe that democracy
promotion became the grand rationale
only well after the failure to find
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that
provided the wrong answer to what Bush
Blair and other were these had stressed
was the single question that motivated
the invasion wrong answer it needs
something new the transformation of
rationale from self-defense to
altruistic idealism passed virtually
without notice except among Iraqis there
were US polls among Iraqis they
dismissed the new rationale is an
absurdity perhaps since they had the
misfortune of living the experience well
a notable feature of these studies on
wilsonian idealism is that the facts of
history are scrupulously ignored it's a
very wise decision in favor of detailed
examination of rhetoric and statements
now if facts were permitted into the
discourse we would quickly discover that
there's considerable merit in Tony
Smith's description of Reagan as the
most wilsonian of present
since Wilson's time but that course
leads to dangerous turf best avoided
Kenda and other victims far too numerous
to mention don't have the luxury of the
intentional ignorance that's one of the
prerogatives of power and privilege and
one of the foundations of our
intellectual culture as you know a major
theme of it Said's impressive work was
the responsibility of intellectuals
intellectuals kind of an honorific term
has nothing to do with the quality of
what they say or anything like that it's
a term that we use for people who have a
sufficient share of privilege so that
they're able to speak publicly about
human affairs privilege of course
confers responsibilities history
naturally is written by intellectuals so
their own role often appears attractive
even heroic and for a marginal few
that's correct but the true record is
pretty grim back to the earliest days of
recorded history and if that tradition
persists and if we otherwise persist on
our current course the today's critical
issues will not have to be contemplated
by the Beatles and bacteria that may
inherit the earth before too long thanks
okay we have about 20 20 minutes or so
time for questions so are their
microphones
we might not have my okay if it's dirty
okay
stand here because I can hear everyone
they will translate for him yeah
you can educate
no that listen
