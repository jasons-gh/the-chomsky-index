other big news in the u.s. these days is
what we can glean about something called
the trans-pacific partnership what can
you tell us about this trade deal that's
being described as NAFTA on steroids
well actually you can't tell you very
much because it's being kept secret not
entirely secret major corporations are
part of the process they know what's
going on the public is kept almost
entirely out probably there's some
selected elements of Congress that are
allowed to know a bit but it's
essentially an executive agreement
jointly with multinational corporations
we can imagine what it's like and
there's leaks here and there it appears
to be basically within the kind of
framework of the World Trade
Organization and after rules these
things are called free trade agreements
they're not there for one thing though a
lot of what they're involved with
doesn't even isn't even trade it's just
called trade to sneak it into the these
agreements so a good deal of NAFTA and
the World Trade Organization rules are
investor rights provisions it was
nothing to do with trade it's called you
know trade related investment mechanisms
or something a lot of it is pure
protectionism very high protectionist
elements obviously undermines free trade
for the benefit of pharmaceutical
corporations Disney
it's not just to try to protect their
exorbitant profits and harm the
population these are patent rules so
high that if they had existed in the
19th century had been enforced the US
would be an agricultural producer today
could never have developed that nor
could any other country in fact England
couldn't have developed because it was
violating what we now call piracy is the
way the rich countries developed now
they is a phrase for it and trade
theories go up taking away the latter
first you violate all the rules market
rules and then by the time you've
succeeded in developing you kick away
the ladders of others can't do it too
and you prayed about free trade the
pharmaceutical corporations for example
claim that they need these exorbitant
profits for research and development but
it's been shown free well particularly
by economist Dean Baker and couple
others that that most of their serious
research the hard research is done in
the public sector anyway and if it was
all done in the public sector and they
were forced onto the market
there'd be a huge saving to come
consumers but of course reduction and
profits and that's the kind of thing
that's going on and what happens to all
worker rights and while labor rights and
environmental protections such as they
are
in deals like this what do we know from
NAFTA about whether the standards of all
the countries involved in which took
about 17 countries in the Pacific Rim
including Vietnam whether they rise up
or or trickle down labor rates don't
exist in fact the naft is a good case
it's been studied quite well it's one of
those rare trade agreements where the
working class and the peasants and
farmers in all three countries suffered
a lot of profits but
and one of the reasons for NAFTA for
example was take the Mexican that is
Elizabeth supposedly an immigration
crisis in the United States why why are
people fleeing to the United States well
some are actually still fleeing from the
ravages of reagan's wars in the 1980s
and Guatemalan Highlands and so on
plenty are coming from Mexico the
Mexican US border used to be an open
border for the open border and pretty
much the same people live on both sides
like most borders it was established by
conquest in fact a very aggressive for
us conquered half of Mexico in 1994 and
Clinton started militarizing the border
1994 is the year when NAFTA was pushed
through
we don't have internal documents so you
have to speculate but I think it's
likely that the Clinton administration
understood that NAFTA was going to
undermine Mexican farming Mexican
campesinos are quite efficient but they
can't compete with highly subsidized the
u.s. agribusiness the US doesn't observe
the free trade principles those are for
the weak
so the agribusiness is highly subsidized
and porous products into Mexico drives
out Mexican farmers maybe they try to go
into the cities not if jobs support them
so they flee across the border if that's
what happened done enough to what can we
expect if the trans-pacific partnership
goes forward well probably on steroids
like the critics are saying but we
really can't be sure because it is kept
secret from the population though not
from the corporate sector from which we
can draw some plausible conclusions and
anything this is being rammed down the
throats of the populations of the world
by a state corporate pattern acting in
tandem so we can make guesses as to what
it's likely to be now quite apart from
the record we've seen what the
see more about how bad the trans-pacific
partnership is in these videos click
