latest world prices Yugoslavia because
they're in searches work we've discussed
in we were going to the Oh more gangsta
troops going in because three reasons
one like you've made clear America and
Britain have got no record of
humanitarian aid and the and they're the
main troops in this plan
secondly they've all I think they've
already made things worse with the Owens
Vance plan as Stuart more ethnic
conflict given the things dying down
according to The Economist and thirdly I
think that the insert the planned
intervention is going to push the
ordinary person in Yugoslavia back
behind their nationalist rulers and and
make a genuine settlement of the area
harder to come by so but you know I'd
like to hear your view on that one you
could be right
I think it's it's very uncertain and I
think that you know trying to predict
something like that is pretty pretty low
probability judgment my own low
probability judgment for what it's worth
is that for the moment the least
horrible of a set of extremely horrible
options and I say I don't say the best
because it's so bad you can't use that
word but the least horrible for the
moment is something like the event Owen
plan and with a peacekeeping force
pregnant you know it'd be nice if you
could get only troops from places like
Luxembourg and so on which don't have
you know too much likelihood of pursuing
their own national interests in the hope
that somehow that will damp down the
troubles provide a safe zone for what's
left of a bosnian bosnian muslims maybe
create the possibility of a multi at
multi ethnic force developing that could
do
local patrolling and so on and then hope
that probably most plausibly within the
framework of a broader European
settlement one of the I think has some
relevance to Ireland too in the context
of ICI you know the European community
there's a centralization of authority at
an executive level the kind of thing I
was talking about but there's a
competing tendency towards
regionalization which i think is pretty
healthy actually you know as a lot of
ugly things but in general it's quite
healthy and that opens the possibility
that many of these conflicts that have
arisen within nation-state systems which
are very brutal systems part of that
reason for the extremely violent history
of Europe over the last centuries and
the savage injustice of the Europeans
that Adam Smith wrote about which has
got worse than a couple hundred years
after part of the reason for that is
that Europe was the leader in imposing
the nation-state
which is a very anti human structure and
it takes extraordinary violence to
impose it and it could begin to break
down a bit in the context of the
increasing regionalization and in that
framework you can imagine you know
federal arrangements and regional
structures and so on maybe a long term
hope would be for the ICI to accept not
just Slovenia and maybe Croatia the rich
areas but all the parts of the former
Yugoslavia as associates in parallel and
to become involved in a serious way in
constructive development programs there
which is not impossible it was done to a
certain extent with Spain and Portugal
and Greece before they were brought into
the EC and in that context it's possible
that you know that especially that can
go in parallel with multi-ethnic
policing forces and other inter-communal
arrangements and a dampening down of the
ethnic of the current violence it's
conceivable that something
you know decent could emerge from it I
don't think this is very high
probability frankly but I don't know of
any better option you have a middle
management of the new order which as far
as I would be concerned be the people
who would have moved my mind from I was
a child right that would be teachers and
and so on and you even mentioned people
who have written history which actually
supports and praises people so looking
at it from my standpoint that is people
who are working at my level trying to
move me if they're the first line of
attack that I meet as a child growing up
what then should we as a community be
doing to try and turn people like that
and to develop our own self confidence
to develop a world citizens well I don't
think there's much hope in influencing
the which might unkindly call the
commissar class to change their position
on things because they have a stake in
it in fact the reason why they made it
to that position is because they would
be willing to serve power there's good
reason why intellectuals tend
overwhelmingly to be subordinate to
power it's almost a tautology the ones
who refuse to be subordinate to power
don't become what we call intellectuals
they become taxi drivers or something
like that but
you know I mean the term intellectual
has nothing to do with intellectual
ability or intellectual achievement or
anything else it has to do with working
into certain positions of respectability
in which you've become a doctor or
manager and naturally the doctrinal
managers are going to be the ones who
support power now it's not a hundred
percent you know systems are fluid but
to us there's going to be a tendency in
that direction or strong tendency and
the way to the way to change it is the
way to change any system of power
first of all undermine the power you
don't democratize the systems create
your own alternative institutions and
place those institutions under public
control so you know the taxi drivers who
have brains become the intellectuals but
that's the same as anything else that's
the same as breaking down a you know the
managerial structure of General Motors
it's true that for a lot of us that sort
of that's like the first front because
that's where we live but other people
live somewhere else
they live in in the factory they have
the same problem that we have professor
Chomsky you've wrote a few books about
low-intensity war and state oppression
you know a lot of observers say that's
going on Island now are you gonna write
a book about Island sometime in the
future as written some things in which I
went through the u.s. I don't know the
British documents very well I assume
they're the same the US government
documents on what's called low-intensity
conflict and looked through the
definitions and the analyses and so on
and they're interesting they happen to
be identical with the definitions of
terrorism III mean identical so
terrorism is defined and say the US Army
manual as I forget the exact words but
something like you know the use or
threat of violence against civilians
with the intent of chiefing achieving I
geological or political or religious
ends short of you know nuclear weapons I
mean short of massive violence that's
terrorism and that's exactly the
definition that's given of low intensity
conflict you take a look at that that
the manuals on low intensity conflict
it's the use or threat of violence short
of outright aggression to achieve
political and social ends directed
against civilian populations and the
definitions are exactly right low
intensity conflict is just international
usually international terrorism usually
international because there's usually a
big foreign power you know supporting
the local you know the local gangsters
but about the only difference between
low intensity conflict and what's called
terrorism is scale low intensity
conflict is usually massive in scale its
wholesale terrorism whereas what's
called terrorism is retail terrorism
carried out by small actors takes a take
say that the case for which the United
States was condemned at the world court
international terrorism but kind of low
intensity conflict the fact one of the
classic examples of low intensity
conflict the war against Nicaragua
it wasn't outright aggression you know
the Marines didn't land they didn't bomb
the place with b-52s or they wanted to
they couldn't because of the popular
opposition at home that's one of the
changes over the last thirty years so
they couldn't do what John F Kennedy did
in South Vietnam
you know just blast the place to pieces
they had to go to low intensity conflict
which meant and look closely at what it
meant the Contra forces the US terrorist
forces attacking Nicaragua from across
the border were directed by SOUTHCOM the
u.s. command and Panama as the chief
general who was been moved over became
NATO commander said and they were
directed to attack what he called soft
targets not I'm quoting him not to duke
it out with the Sandinistas directly
meaning don't attack military forces
because they can shoot back attack soft
targets okay soft targets means things
like health clinics
schools you know agricultural
cooperatives and so on well after this
congressional testimony was given by
general Galvan the head of south come
you know the Southern Command and Panama
there were the press didn't say anything
funny about it you know I just reported
it but the human rights groups picked it
up the Americas watch asked it protested
to the State Department and asked is
this you know is really our policy and
Charles Redman who's the State
Department spokesman said yeah that's
our policy and furthermore it's correct
he said agricultural cooperatives are
the people in agricultural cooperatives
have arms to defend themselves and
therefore they are legitimate military
targets so therefore we can go in and
blow up you know
agricultural cooperative well America's
watch pointed out that by the same logic
Palestinian terrorists could go and
attack an Israeli kibbutz let's say but
it was never any answer to that it was
interested it was very little comment
abut notice that that sort of makes the
point low intensity conflict is just
international terrorism with a large
scale Michael Kinsley is center-right no
far left and he's considered so like the
conscience of a new republic which is he
had a response to this he said that we
shouldn't be too quick to condemn the
State Department for authorizing attacks
on soft targets on agricultural
cooperatives and so on that is
international terrorism we shouldn't be
too quick to condemn it because he said
we have to carry out what he called a
cost-benefit analysis we have to weigh
the amount of blood and violence put in
with the likelihood that democracy you
know what we call democracy will come
out at the other end and if the amount
of you know blood and gore going in and
the amount of democracy as we judge it
that the other end is coming out as a
favorable balance then the cost-benefit
analysis as it is it legitimate okay
that's not a - towards international
terrorism on the part of the more
violent that's an extremist advic
it's other namely American liberals
that's low-intensity conflict and that's
the same everywhere when the United
States carries out international
terrorism it's not like wouldn't say
Libya does I'm in Libya's at you know a
small country they may hire say Carlos
if they have you know some international
terrorists and tell them to do something
but the United States doesn't do it that
way United States a big player the
United States hires terrorist States you
know so if you take a look at the
iran-contra hearings and you know the
iran-contra affair and look actually at
what happened what happened is that the
war against Nicaragua involved a whole
array of terrorist States Taiwan and
Israel were there training the killers
Saudi Arabia and Brunei were funding the
operation
you know Britain was supplying
specialists and experts to tell you how
to attack and destroy soft targets they
know about that thing that eight hundred
years of experience the I mean that's
you know that's a big operation the one
that's big large-scale international
terrorism that is low intensity conflict
they're no different you know and say
the same thing here I mean you can draw
the same conclusions its standard do you
see the Christian churches on both sides
supporting as they did in the 19th
century the emergence of this new form
of international capitalism well I don't
know the situation in Ireland we'll
enough to comment the one that I know
best is actually Latin America but
traditionally you're actually right I
mean up until you know the 1950s or the
1960s the church was just the Church of
the rich it was the Church of the
oppressors again it's not a hundred
percent but overwhelmingly it was the
Church of the oppressors the message was
don't worry about this insignificant
world you know things will be okay later
on while the rich men rule and the
church itself was totally corrupt I mean
you know it's just unbelievably
disgraceful in its whole history
with some exceptions here and there that
changed for reasons we aren't at all
clear to me around the 50s and the 60s
with worker priests and then crucially
the emergence of Liberation Theology in
in in Latin America which was quite
important and I think and I'm not great
expert in church history but I should
tell you that as a child I was lived we
were the only Jewish family in an Irish
and German Catholic neighborhood and I
was an adult before I could overcome my
visceral fear of Kappa so I don't I
don't have no great specialist in the
church but when Liberation Theology
became significant in the 6th in
especially in six days in the seventies
it was really a historic change in the
church I mean and the the midian and web
love bishops conferences were extremely
important events you know that's when
the so-called preferential option for
the poor was adopted officially and it
had a tremendous effect I mean it
affected the other Christian churches as
well at least in the United States the
effects of liberation theology were very
widespread across the protestant
churches as well including the
fundamentalist evangelical movements
which are split on this issue you know
on the one hand they'll provide
witnesses for peace on the other hand
they provide you know right-wing crazy
Oh with a lot of commitment but the and
in fact the the war that the United
States fought in Central America for the
last ten years since nineteen eighty was
to a very significant extent of war
against the church it's not an act I
mean I think it's very significant that
it began you know sort of it sort of
really took off with the assassination
of the archbishop Archbishop Romero and
a decade came to an end with the murder
of the nine Jesuit intellectuals that
was that symbolized what was going on I
mean these were the people
who were leading the way with a lot of
intelligence and tremendous courage
towards organizing the poor to take
things into their own hands they were
creating the rotten apple and that led
to an extremely savage reaction with
hundreds of thousands of people
slaughtered not just killed you know but
tortured and murdered and mutilated Pol
Pot style because he got to teach him a
lesson
and it's in fact continuing because you
really have to drive that lesson home
and it's striking to said the Vatican
unfort very unfortunately though pope
john xxiii gave a tremendous impetus for
this to everybody surprise the next pope
the vatican then fell into the hands of
a quite a reactionary group who tried to
stem this tide and have been trying in
all sorts of ways by selecting the most
reactionary Cardinal they can find and
that will I imagine that's going on here
too but it but interesting quite
interestingly it hasn't stopped it I
don't know if they reported here the the
next bishops conference the 1992 Santa
Domingo conference in 1992 December 1992
was the first Latin Americans bishops
conference after Medina and Puebla the
big ones this time the Vatican wasn't
taking any chances so they ran the
agenda you know they set the whole thing
up so nothing was going to happen they
didn't let the Latin American bishops
have much initiative nevertheless the
document that came out was so radical
they couldn't report it in the United
States and it was a big attack I
literally was not reported as far as I
know there was writing you know next
door Santa Domingo the they it was a
sharp attack on the whole neo
rural structural adjustment programs
which is destroying democracy and
creating poverty and they declared that
it's the mission of the church
you know the parishes and everything
else to struggle against this and they
were iterated the whole business
they described the poverty spreading
through the region which has been
enormous these has been a rapid increase
in deep impoverishment since the
structural adjustment programs were
imposed in the mid 80s they describe
that as not you know automatic not
coming from natural law but the result
of human decisions which are destructive
and which the church has to combat and
that's very progressive well of course
that leads to the process that you
described there's been a big effort to
get around them by extremely well-funded
operations super well-funded operations
in which usually evangelical churches
come into places like Guatemala and so
on and try to restore the traditional
message message being this world doesn't
matter you know just worry about the
next world familiar with that and it's
succeeded to some extent I mean when
people are extremely demoralized and
they've just had their communities
devastated and so on they're often
susceptible to such a message and I
don't know the estimates are that maybe
a quarter of the Guatemalan population
it has now joined one or another
Evangelical Church on the other hand the
the other Christian communities are also
split so the evangelical Christians in
Nicaragua have been at the forefront of
social development projects and so on
it's a very double-edged sort of thing
you know I think it could go
anyway I should say in general the when
that when the North American bishops say
the US bishops come out with a statement
on almost any topic except abortion and
so on it's it's so radical that the
press can't cover it on the economy you
know on Latin America it's just off the
spectrum of discussion in the United
and that's you know pretty conservative
bishops right now wasn't true thirty
years ago you've made it America right
to be an evil empire and yet too many
Irish people America is the Savior so
would you explain that to me please if
you mean the American state it's not
going to save anybody except the rich
men who run the world because that's who
it serves if you mean the American
population there's all kind of things
going on the American population has
changed tremendously in the last thirty
years much more civilized
you know the cultural level is increased
enormously the moral levels increase
this is cause total hysteria among
intellectuals that's why you have this
big campaign about what they call
political correctness meaning there are
just lots of people around who don't
agree that you should be racist and
sexist and they they have respect for
other cultures and all sorts of other
crimes that's definitely happened second
second in sectors of the American public
it's a very mixed story I mean it's you
know on the other hand it's one of the
most fanatic fundamentalist countries in
the world people talk about Islamic
fundamentalism the United States is more
fundamentalist than any Islamic country
I know probably more than Iran I don't
know how many of you saw the might have
if they showed here the first night of
the Republican National Convention the
this thing called a God and country
rally which you just couldn't find
anywhere except in pre-industrial
societies you know religious fanaticism
jingoist fanaticism and so on you have
that on the one hand you have you have a
populations almost out of control on
social and cultural issues because it's
going so far look to you know but call
the left or something on other things
well that's you know that's the
populations if you're looking for the
state as a savior I would look somewhere
else you know that for any of that or
any other state
would you comment professor on the
development of the movement for ethical
restriction or control of multinational
investment and how this can be exploited
by oppressed peoples in third-world
countries part of the the interaction
with the third world on the part of you
know decent good-hearted people who go
out there to help it's doubtful how much
beneficial effect its had on the third
world but it's had a very beneficial
effect on the home societies because
people have seen things in the world
they get a different perspective they
begin to understand you know changes
your attitude and so on that makes a big
difference back at home and things like
ethics investment I think are like that
I mean its net effect on investment is
very slight I mean there really is no
such thing as ethical investment you
know Visnic business ethics i mean is
like a contradiction in terms
you know you can't have it it's all
robbery the Kanani question is what form
of robbery it is you can have ethical
robbery and unethical robbery but not
much else on the other hand just to
begin to think about the issues is
worthwhile the preferred workforce is
women who are driven you know who are
simply driven off the rural areas or you
know urban slums and who will work for
extremely low wages under impossible
conditions and will die after a couple
of years and any replacing by other
women I mean that's been going on to an
enormous extent the the case of
biotechnology in a way is a bit more
subtle but quite important and it also
involves women crucially one a part of
the part of this current effort to
increase protectionism through GATT that
is to protect intellectual property a
large part of it is directed towards
control over scenes and drugs
now that's a big thing you know in
comparison to controlling seeds and
drugs or animal species and so on
Electronics is like a thrill you know
these are the means of life right so
it's a huge business the the Western
corporations expect to make a mint out
of it I mean they're they're talking in
terms of hundreds of billions of dollars
of profit in yearly from taking the what
they're really doing is taking the lore
of the third world you know
accumulated over thousands of years of
experience plant breeding selecting
herbs and so on and so forth
taking that lore robbing it they don't
get anything for it you know making
slight modifications through
biotechnology and cloning new species
and you know new seeds and so on forcing
them back on the third world so that
people have to pay royalties when they
replant their crops and so on and then
making a hundreds of millions of
billions of dollars of profit yearly
from this this is a huge business for
the future well where do women fit in
the people are robbing are mostly women
I mean the agricultural and medical lore
of the third world is mostly women's
lore I mean for for millennia for
millennia women have been in charge of
in most countries and in selecting
plants determining where they can grow
you know teaching all this stuff finding
the herbs that do something or other
teaching this stuff to the daughters you
know it's been something that's been
going on forever you know in human
history and of course it's totally
unvalued its value is considered zero
partly because it's third world but even
more so because it's women in the third
world one of the reasons why quite
standardly in in a third world country
when scientific methods of agricultural
are introduced yield declines that's
continually been noticed one of the
reasons is because all this lore is
destroyed but there's some good Studies
on this there's a couple of recent
studies about say Liberia which has been
under US control for a long time where
they came in with scientific methods of
agricultural development happen in Haiti
too and quite commonly yield declined
you know everything's subjected disease
and so on well when you look closely at
some ethno botanist and others have done
it's because the women and their
daughters and so on who've worked all
this stuff out over the centuries are
actually over the millennia have learned
that you know on this side of the hill
you can plant this particular kind of
grain you know when the Sun is coming
over here but under a rock on the other
side of the hill you have to plant a
different kind of grain and so on and so
forth and that turns out to be extremely
efficient agriculture also with great
diversity so it's not subject to massive
plague diseases and destruction well of
course all that stuff is wiped out when
the scientific guys come in with the
bulldozers and smash everything and you
know plant clone crops from the West and
yields go down their subject the disease
you have to have huge amounts of
fertilizer and pesticide you know
ecological destruction and so on that's
primarily involving women in fact
there's plenty of things like this same
is true in the arts so take them in take
a look at the difference between arts
and crafts it's a curious distinction if
you look at it for most of human history
art was done by women like textiles
that's not called art and that's crafts
it's only becomes art when it's done by
men and in fact done individually so
crafts or some denigrated thing I mean
there's tons of stuff like this a
feminist scholarship has brought a lot
of it out but as far as I can see it can
all be said quite simply I don't think
it needs the intellectual resources of
feminist scholarships Adams perfect
white skeptical about I think a lot of
new insights have been brought about by
this kind of work but again like just
about everything else we understand it
seems to me kind of on the surface once
you see it you know once your prejudices
are broken and you look it's all obvious
breaking the prejudices know
simple matter that's a big problem over
25 years what will Western capitalism do
with this very virulent stream of rotten
apple which has become almost immune to
antibiotics and whatever else has come
along and how do we I suppose in a
capitalist sense how do we market what
we've got here which is the development
the resistance the determination of
years and years of struggle but we're
not in the third world were right shlop
buying in the middle of Western
capitalism I mean I you know I I
wouldn't even dream of saying how things
should happen here I don't know enough
you know fifty thousand times as much as
I do so you have to give the answers but
the general answer seemed to me about
the same everywhere the general answers
are to recognize that the authoritarian
control of the way life is organized
meaning everything from investment
decisions and decisions over you know
commercial arrangements and and so on up
through politics and teaching and so on
all of that structure of authority is
fundamentally illegitimate if it's it
should be challenged you know to the
extent possible it should be dissolved
control over all of these things
crucially investment decisions should be
in public hands in communities and
workforces and so on and out of that
there are there is tremendous wealth
around I don't things ain't out that
there's enough wealth in you know enough
resources in say northern island to
develop quite a you know quite a healthy
and productive and growing society but
it's not gonna happen if the decisions
are being made in London and Zurich and
New York and so on can only happen if
the decisions are being made here and
then you know mistakes will be made but
they can be corrected and there's
possibilities of development but just
how to do that specifically you know
people here have
work out like to take an opportunity on
behalf of the organizers mime very
grateful for the privilege of being
allowed to make this presentation of I
think you can see it here for those of
you who can't read it that distance it's
a plot here of Robert Bala's Robert as
most of you will know is an artist
nationally acclaimed artist who is
heading up at present the Irish National
Congress in the campion for the right of
articles two and three it's a new
revised history of Ireland and shows two
persons at the time of the famine and
the inscription underneath says in 1847
two peasants to be at the benefits of a
low starch diet
I understand neither of them were banned
from interview by RTA
I'd like to present this tonight
