touring test is fooled by algorithmic
systems we said something like that well
how will we know when we do have an
intelligent computer talk to it longer
no we're not we we don't know ever know
whether we have an intelligent computer
any more than we will know whether we
have an airplane that flies it's a
meaningless question exactly's Turing
said how close I ask you this question
where let's say we're back in nineteen
eight you know or whatever first right
thing was and suppose somebody came
along and said suppose I make something
that goes up in the air how we want to
know the Flies you know it will fly no
question that's the way there's going to
fly if you want to call that stuff
flying okay
in English you have to decide the
croelick flying some other language
would call it something else but there
is no empirical question as to whether
in the airplane flies and there is no
empirical question as to whether an
algorithm thinks for exactly the same
reason English and thinking is something
humans do this or even better than a big
matrix of human interests and so on and
just as airplanes don't do whatever his
birds are doing
similarly algorithms our brains are not
doing things like for example is there a
question as to whether brains thing
well brains don't think of course they
don't think my brain doesn't seem trying
to have a brain let's forget computers
my brain doesn't see triangles for
trivial reasons seeing triangles as a
human action we attribute that
characterization to humans in a chrome
work of human interests and concerns and
motives the motion of this notion is of
absolutely no use for science I mean we
don't study in the sciences things like
thinking any more than we study things
like desks is not answers I mean these
are concepts of common sense now belong
in the sciences they don't enter into
rational explanatory theories so in the
sciences you constantly trying to get
rid of all these things and move to
concepts that have some utility not
things like this or thinking or
something like that or digestion you
know you look at what's actually
happening try to understand it in terms
of whatever
concepts and principles are relevant but
to ask the question whether a
program thinks or whether a brain sees a
triangle is this dumb is asking whether
an airplane flies is not going to have
an answer for trivial reasons there is
no answer to the question whether
airplanes fly and there's no point
setting up an analogue of the Turing
test that says well can we construct
something that's not a pool of human
under some circumstances that won't tell
us whether it's flying or not and why
don't we make a machine with the
attributes like the human brain very
complicated like the human brain the
human brain doesn't think humans do but
human brains don't any more than your
brain sees a triangle your brain doesn't
see triangle for quite uninteresting
reasons and correspondingly something
with the characteristics if your brain
doesn't see it trying people are the
ones who do things like that just as
shirring said now you can ask pointless
questions like what will be the
empirical conditions under which an
airplane flies if you ask the pointless
question you're never going to get an
answer of course no it's interesting
that any you know dealing with sort of
phenomenal world like airplanes flying
nobody asks those silly questions I mean
something tried to start a new science
dealing with the question where their
airplanes fly they don't even put a
human spin applause first nobody came
and said how do we know that humans
can't fly Olympics some guy went 30 feet
why isn't that flying so any one order
of magnitude less chicken it has no
answer you know it's a matter of
decision whether we want to call that
flying
