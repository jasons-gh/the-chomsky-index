is democracy now democracynow.org the
war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
down there and that's a welcome to our
listeners and viewers around the country
and around the world Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived
in Washington as part of his bid to stop
a nuclear deal with Iran Netanyahu will
address the lobby group AIPAC today
followed by a controversial speech
before Congress on Tuesday the visit
comes just as Iran and six world powers
including the US are set to resume talks
in a bid to meet a march 31st deadline
at the White House press secretary Josh
earnest said Netanyahu's trip won't
threaten the outcome I think the short
answer to that is I don't think so
and the reason is simply that there is a
real opportunity for us here and the
president is hopeful that we are going
to have an opportunity to do what is
clearly in the best interests of the
United States and Israel which is to
resolve the international community's
concerns about Iran's nuclear program at
the negotiating table the trip has
sparked the worst public rifts between
the US and Israel and over two decades
dozens of Democrats could boycott
Netanyahu's address to Congress which
was arranged by House Speaker John
Boehner without consulting the White
House the Obama administration will send
two officials National Security Advisor
Susan Rice and UN Ambassador Samantha
power to address the APEC summit today
this comes just days after rice called
Netanyahu's visit quote destructive
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is also facing domestic
criticism for his unconventional
Washington visit which comes just two
weeks before an election in which he
seeks a third term in Israel on Sunday a
group representing nearly 200 of
Israel's top retired military and
intelligence officials accused Netanyahu
of assaulting the u.s. Israel alliance
but despite talk of a US and Israeli
dispute the Obama administration has
taken pains to display its staunch
support for the Israeli government
speaking just today in Geneva Secretary
of State John Kerry blasted the UN Human
Rights Council for what he called an
obsession and bias against Israel the
council is expected to release a report
in the coming weeks on potential war
crime
in Israel's us-backed Gaza assault last
summer for more we spend the hour today
with world renowned political dissident
linguist author Noam Chomsky he has
written over a hundred books most
recently on Western terrorism from
Hiroshima to drone warfare his
forthcoming book co-authored with Ilan
Pappe is titled on Palestine and will be
out next month Noam Chomsky is Institute
professor emeritus at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology where he's
taught for more than 50 years Noam
Chomsky it's great to have you back here
at Democracy Now and particularly in our
very snowing outside but warm inside New
York studio delighted to be here again
well known let's start with Netanyahu's
visit he will is set to make this
unprecedented joint address to Congress
unprecedented because of the kind of
rift it is demonstrated between the
Republicans and the Democratic president
President Obama can you talk about its
significance for both President Prime
Minister Netanyahu and the Hawks in
Congress most Republican the primary
goal is to undermine any potential
negotiation that might settle whatever
issue there is with Iran they have a
common interest in ensuring that there
is no regional force that can serve as
any kind of deterrent to Israeli and US
violence the major violence in the
region and it is if we believe US
intelligence don't see any reason not to
their analysis is that if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons which they
don't know it would be part of their
deterrent strategy there they would
their general strategic posture is one
of deterrence the
have low military expenditures there
according to US intelligence their
strategic doctrine is to try to prevent
an attack up to the point where
diplomacy can set in I don't think
anyone with a gray cell functioning
thinks that they would ever conceivably
use a nuclear weapon or even try to the
country would be obliterated in 15
seconds but they might provide a
deterrent of sorts and the US and Israel
certainly don't want to tolerate that
they are the forces that carry out
regular violence and aggression in the
region and don't want any impediment to
that for the Republicans in Congress
there's another interest namely to
undermine anything that Obama you know
the Antichrist might try to do so that's
a separate issue there the Republicans
stopped being a ordinary parliamentary
party some years ago there they were
described I think accurately by Norman
Ornstein very respected conservative
political analyst American Enterprise
Institute he said the party has become a
radical insurgency which has abandoned
any commitment to parliamentary
democracy and their goal for the last
years has simply been to undermine
anything that Obama might do in an
effort to regain power and serve their
primary constituency which is the very
wealthy and the corporate sector they
try to conceal this with all sorts of
other means and doing so they've had to
you can't get votes that way so they've
had to mobilize sectors of the
population which have always been there
but we're never mobilized into an
organized political force evangelical
Christians extreme nationalists
terrified people who have to carry guns
into Starbucks because somebody might be
after them and so on and so forth that's
a big force and inspiring fear is
not very difficult in the United States
it's a long history back to colonial
times of as an extremely frightened
society which is an interesting story in
itself and mobilizing people in fear of
them whoever them happens to be is an
effective technique used over and over
again and right now the Republicans have
their their non policy has succeeded in
putting them back in a position of least
congressional power so this the attack
on this is a personal attack on Obama
and intended that way is simply part of
that general effort but there is a
common strategic concerns underlying it
I think and that is pretty much what US
intelligence analyzes preventing any
deterrent in the region to US and
Israeli actions
