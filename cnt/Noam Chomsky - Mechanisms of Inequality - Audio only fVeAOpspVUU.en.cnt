some people when a here Noam Chomsky
speak or when they read his work say
they really understand where he's coming
from but in one sense his political
economic writings are very simple to
understand he strives to write about
ways in which the full participation of
everybody is denied and stripes ways to
have that full participation brought
back the people he strives for ways to
encourage voice for everybody people who
have you who have had your voices denied
sometimes and disastrous ways and he's
written and spoken about endlessly in
trying to transform political economic
system structures that stand in the way
of us enjoying our life together in a
peaceful way we're very happy to have
him here today and maybe we could
welcome him with a great sense of
gratitude for Noam Chomsky little over
200 years ago Tom Paine summarized his
hopes for the American Revolution that
he had helped to inspire he used the
natural rights idiom of his day updated
in the given a contemporary form in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 50
years ago Payne hoped that the American
Revolution would come to be what he
called the first popular
counter-revolution in history it would
be popular because it would be the first
one to defend the rights of the bulk of
mankind and it would be a
counter-revolution because it would seek
to recover rights that are indefeasible
hereditary rooted in our major rights
that had been lost to conquest and
tyranny which had dispossessed man of
his rights the counter-revolution he
hoped would promise
irri to the human race well I guess
restorative justice could be usefully
understood in similar terms namely as
seeking to restore the full range of
inherent rights of which people have
been dispossessed by constantly changing
forms of conquest and tyranny in that
same year 1792 the leading framer of the
new constitutional order James Madison
expressed his growing concern over the
fate of the democratic experiment that
was just beginning it was beginning all
ready to take the form of a
developmental capitalist state along
lines advocated by his associate and
rival Alexander Hamilton Madison warned
in 1792 that this if this continued it
would lead through a government
substituting the motive of private
interest over public duty the private
interest would furthermore become
concentrated and consolidated leading to
a real domination of the few under an
apparent liberty of the many Madison
deplored what he called the daring
depravity of the times as the stock
jobbers become the tools and tyrants of
government bribed by its large esas over
owing it with their clamors and
combinations he foresaw that business
would become wouldn't cast over society
the shadow that we call politics
borrowing now the term of John Dewey
under 50 years later describing the
outcome the existing the existing
reality not giving a kind of a
worst-case scenario for the future well
it's kind of illuminating I think to
view the last several centuries of
history as a conflict between these
tendencies which were very clear at the
outset the Great Beast is Alexander
Hamilton called the people the Great
Beast has over time actually
when many victories restored recovered
lots of Rights instituted rights more
firmly from Thomas Paine's point of view
there have also been periods of
regression with a powerful assault on
rights and on democracy leading to a
real domination of the few under the
apparent liberty of the many and we
happen to be living in one of those
periods of regression now not first
probably not the last it's a period of
dedicated and very self-conscious
assault an elite effort which has
clearly has been aimed for the last 30
years to reverse the democratizing and
civilizing effects of the activism of
the 1960s and subsequent years and to
drive the dreaded Great Beast back to
its cage and as always the East isn't
retiring quietly that confrontation
which goes back here for 200 years but
goes back in history far beyond that
confrontation took sharply new
institutional forms about a century ago
with the consolidation of private power
in the course of the process that's
usually called the corporatization of
America to let quite a substantial
increase in the power of the tools and
tyrants of government and their ability
to overall it with their Glamour's which
were louder in their combinations which
were great essentially to take over the
government instead of merely casting a
shadow and also led to an increasing
ability on their part to demand to
receive enormous large esas through a
variety of means that includes wide
range from say the free risk insurance
that's granted by the IMF to investors
to the ability to socialize costs by
relying on a dynamic state sector to
create the basis for the profits of the
future right
for what's called the new economy and
planning now for the next one to come
World War two drove that lesson home it
taught the corporate managers who flucht
the Washington to run the semi command
economy it taught them that a state
directed economy could indeed flourish
that get the United States out of a deep
depression as it did and lead the huge
industrial developed them a successful
period of economic development and US
history by far was during those years by
then as it also become clear to the very
same corporate managers that that was
not only a possible system but a
necessary once they put it right after
the Second World War high tech industry
cannot survive and a competitive
unsubsidized free enterprise economy and
the government is the only possible
Savior that's fortune and Businessweek
expressing a pretty broad consensus and
for telling the economic future the next
half century 60 years it was also
understood pretty quickly how they could
get the Great Beast to accept this
arrangement I was explained the mainly
usual device terrify them and they'll
accept penny Truman's first secretary of
the air force Stuart Symington good
Liberal Democratic cinelli he explained
that the word the talk is not subsidy
the word the talk is security that way
we can get our subsidies from the Great
Beast hiding in fear and that remains
true i mean the enemies change for a
long time it was john f kennedy's
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy as he
put it bent on world conquest later it
shifted the international terrorism
marco guerrillas rogue states or
whatever may be convenient and it's
going to have to change tomorrow to
justify current plans the current
bipartisan programs which are extremely
ominous and developing quickly the pro
terms of militarization of space of
extending right now it's us monopoly but
ultimately we'll be extending the arms
race int the militarization of space
with the goal which is quite clearly
expressed there's no reason not for us
not to know that it was expressed
clearly by Clinton's Space Command that
a year ago who explained that the in a
public document that the goal is to
dominate the space dimensions of
military operations to protect us
interests and investments and US
commercial interests generally they went
on to compare this two navies in earlier
centuries and that's an apt comparison
navies in fact were developed to protect
global investments and commercial
interests of Britain and later the
United States some extent others and
also naval development to go back a
century naval development provided a
huge stimulus for the steel industry
that's how the great pacifist Andrew
Carnegie constructed the first
billion-dollar corporation relying
heavily on naval contracts and others
two navies were crucial in developing
the most advanced technology the age the
hardest technological problems of
machine construction electronics of a
century ago had to do with placing huge
naval guns on big ships that were moving
around and aiming at a moving target
turns out to be quite a tricky problem
and that was the cutting edge of
technology and the industrial
development century ago pretty much the
way Space Research is today there's the
deal of similarity as expected that's
the way the post-second World War system
of public financing of private profit
developed and it is expected to continue
in the future notice that this is not
military industry contrary to what
people often say it's misleading the
cola de military-industrial complex it's
true that there's a military cover and
occasionally spin-off to the military
but it's primarily a mode
of the sustaining the the private profit
economy very much as fortunate
businessweek recognized sixty years ago
and in fact this everyone recognizes
except the Great Beast who isn't
supposed to understand this maybe the
economics profession doesn't understand
that I'm not sure but it's pretty clear
that should be clear to everyone else
all of this nah makes sense but fits
into a well-established historical
pattern meanwhile the the same processes
should allow the increasing power and
concentration of the tools and tyrants
who want to be able to administer
markets through mergers and strategic
alliances outsourcing fact whole range
of devices to ensure that the rich and
the powerful don't have to face market
discipline the poor and the defenseless
on contrast must be subjected to it that
again continues a historic pattern of
several centuries which play a large
role in determining the countries of the
world that we live in right now well
about a century ago going back to the
corporation urines I'm sure you know the
rights of persons were extended to these
newly consolidating corporate entities
then later the rights of persons were
extended their management this was by
radical judicial activism for the most
part very little legislation it was very
sharply condemned by conservatives it's
a category of people who did exist the
centuries ago the name still exists but
not the category conservatives were
deeply upset by this they condemned it
as returned the feudalism and form of
communism not without reason there's
very little doubt that the founders of
classical liberalism would have been
appalled as would in fact anyone who
understood that that writes in here in
persons of flesh and blood not in
totalitarian entities or the Central
Committee of the totalitarian entities
the management of a corporation the
comparison to other forms of
totalitarianism is not an exact even the
intellectual roots are similar the
recent trade agreements they go well
beyond what happened the century go they
confer on these fatality and entities
rights that go far beyond those of your
human beings it's worth remembering that
the proponents of the corporatization
process who were mostly progressives
incidentally they century go they
understood exactly what was going on and
they agreed with critics put a little
bit differently but they basically
agreed for example Woodrow Wilson
notable case he observed that in his
words most men will become servants of
corporations which run the business of
the country and our rivals of government
itself and by now have become the
Masters of the Universe in the phrase of
the international business press
Financial Times they were describing the
January meetings in of the international
corporate elite in davos switzerland
last january with only a touch of irony
meant it free accurate Woodrow Wilson
regarded the outcome as in his words a
very different America from the old no
longer a scene of individual enterprise
opportunity and achievement rather a
scene of taking orders and for some
transmitting orders down below depending
on where you stand in the tyrannical
system Wilson and other progressives
understood that it wasn't gonna be easy
to get the Great Beast to accept the new
America that was being created for them
I was also understood that it wouldn't
be possible to do this by force even
though measures of force were not
abandoned Wilson's Red Scare was an
example and US labor history from its
origins right up until very recently has
been extremely unusual in the high level
of violence that was used in comparison
with other industrial societies and even
today in fact labor rights in the United
States are very primitive as compared
with comparable comparable societies
which is not a great surprise in a
business run society well by the 20th
century however it was pretty clear that
force could no longer be relied upon
effectively in the more free and
democratic societies where too many
rights had been won or recovered from
his point of view so is necessary and
understood to be necessary to control
beliefs and attitudes to regiment the
public mind and direct the population to
frivolous pursuits like fashionable
consumption driven by created wants
quotes from business literature eighty
years ago it's necessary to impose what
was called a philosophy of futility so
we should therefore regard it as a
triumph of American democracy and not a
failure when growing numbers of people
regard themselves as powerless as
regular studies of this in polls and the
level of powerlessness has increased to
historic heights in fact right before
the November election well beyond the
previous peak over half the population
about seventy-five percent of the
population and before the election is
nothing to do with Florida shenanigans
before the election about 75% felt that
the election had nothing to do with him
at all just something going on with rich
folk and the public relations industry
and so on and over half felt powerless
people take the polls regard that as a
flaw of American democracy but anything
missing the point it should be regarded
as a triumph that's the way it's was
designed and it's succeeding the rulers
are achieving the goals that's not fair
there are other means of social control
the I mentioned the traditional one and
using fear or Devils the criminals in
the streets but when you have a
frightened and powerless population they
conjure up their own devils and that's
very striking in American society it's
striking to see the fears and paranoia
that are that emerged from depths of
powerlessness actually I think Timothy
McVeigh is an example of that it's kind
of striking that in the in the last
election there are traditional class
partying correlations and they persisted
but they were very considerably
outweighed by other factors factors that
are of little concern to those who cast
the shadow called politics and therefore
factors that are allowed to appear and
right enough focus of attention so for
example a gun ownership and what's
called religiosity a very strongly
outweighed traditional class partying
correlations or economic issues all
together with regard to religiosity
technical term I apologize for it and in
that the u.s. is off the spectrum of
industrial societies it by any standard
measures of religious extremism
fundamentalism the u.s. is just entirely
off the spectrum it's also true of a lot
of other things one of them which is
ominous I think has to do with and does
reveal the at least partial success of
the huge corporate offensive of the
propaganda offensive of the past 20
years one of the one of them has to do
with tolerance of inequality here the
u.s. is very different by now from other
societies there have been some extensive
studies there's not only collar
incivility but belief that the
government should do nothing about it
that it's not a public responsibility
just were some major step across
comparative studies of many societies 30
40 societies and the United States
stands alone in this the only countries
that come closer to client States
Israel and Taiwan rather similar and
Canada not too far behind but most other
countries are quite different in this
regard that's an interesting and
important change it's very radical
change from not very long ago it's a
very remarkable shift from the period of
the mass popular movements labor
movements farmer movements others it's
also an enormous shift from the position
was taken for granted and the classical
liberal origins of modern democracy Adam
Smith for example you may recall that
his rather nuanced advocacy of markets
was based on the principle his belief
that under conditions of equality of
liberty markets would lead to equality
which was he took to be an obvious
desiderata argue for it to the extent
that it would lead to that result some
version of markets would be acceptable
II thought it's kind of interesting to
see how this issue is dealt with in the
ideological realm today not just it's in
the realm of public attitudes it's very
intricate and I think very ominous shift
in the United States and an important
victory for for the corporate media
propaganda system in the ideological
realm takes kind of another form which
is also sort of interesting and
enlightening that there is an economic
doctrine according to economic doctrine
what's called globalization is supposed
to lead the convergence convergence of
to a single market meaning a single wage
and price and income things are supposed
to be coming in fact that's a technical
measure of globalization as the extent
to which you get to get such conversions
move toward equality there are some
theorems that prove its supposed to
happen under conditions that don't
really much to the real world actually
what's called globalization has had the
opposite effect it's led to continuing
to increasing inequality among countries
and more strikingly within country
furthermore that's expected to continue
there's a interesting study that just
came out a couple months ago by the US
intelligence community including will
they brought in a specialist from the
academic world and private sector its
projections for what's likely to happen
by the year 2015 and they give several
scenarios what they describe is the most
optimistic scenario is that
globalization will proceed on course and
here's the description it's evolution
will be Rocky marked by chronic
financial volatility and a widening
economic divide notice what that means
that means less convergence less
globalization in the technical sense of
the term but more globalization in the
doctrinally approved sense meaning
concentration of wealth and power and a
small sector of the Masters of the
Universe financial volatility which they
also predict means slower growth
deterioration and growth and in fact
other standard macroeconomic measures
have all deteriorated that during the
so-called globalization period that's
true of the United States through the
90s and it's true worldwide few
exceptions are the places and didn't
follow the rules there is a lot of talk
you've heard a huge amount of talk about
the fairy tale economy and even if you
look hard enough read that during the
1990s the United States had the greatest
economic boom in its history in fact in
world history Anthony Lewis on the left
in the New York Times it's not a total
fairy tale it's more or less true for a
small sector of the population there is
a small sector that did make out like
bandits maybe greatest economic boom in
world history and those happen
include the people who tell everybody
else the wonderful news but for the ones
who are listening to the happy stories
for the large majority of the population
totally different world this period has
indeed been unusual in American economic
history but for the opposite reason I
don't think there's another period of
say twenty years or ten years which
didn't have any severe economic disaster
so luck was not like the 1930s
depression but any period of more or
less level development in which the
overwhelming majority of the population
for them standard economic and social
indicators either stagnated or declined
that is unusual and that is in fact the
mark of the globalization period in the
United States and to a large extent
worldwide furthermore just orden teman
simple measures of growth of the economy
growth of productivity growth of trade
and others have declined pretty sharply
under globalization but that doesn't
matter it's a success because it is
succeeding in concentrating wealth and
power and crucially it's succeeding in
undermining the Great Beast that's
important and I think that's what it's
all about part of the general
counter-attack against the end of the
democratizing tendencies of the last 30
40 years well let's go back to the last
election polls show pretty clearly that
the what dominated the election would
showed up and such a voting has took
place were what are called non economic
issues insofar as issues were involved
at all actually they weren't involved
very much one of the reasons was that
people couldn't figure out where the
candidates stood on issues of those who
could figure it out you know in some
cases turned out they supported Gore by
a large majority the in this early vote
for him the but for the most part people
didn't vote on issues and that's
understandable result and in fact the
intended result take a look at the huge
propaganda campaign big extravaganza
that was associated with the elections
you know television ads and all that
kind of stuff
it directed people away from issues
towards what's called on the trade
qualities it's supposed to focus on
people's qualities not not issues
qualities means so for example a major
effort to craft George Bush into some
kind of an ordinary guy from West Texas
you know not an alias turner who went to
prep schools and Yale Gore had do he's
also supposed to kind of look off
soulfully into the sunset over the
compassionate face that takes some
training gore was trained to shed the
characteristics of the kid you hated in
fourth grade those were the major issues
and that was the major discussion and
that's what people are supposed to focus
on and it happened where issues did
enter and they did likes a gun control
and so on they had to be confined to
things that are of no particular concern
to the to the rulers so don't care those
issues can arise crucially is the rulers
and the Great Beast differ on some
issues then with their rigorously
excluded from the electoral arena it's
kind of dramatic to see how this happens
if they is a good reason for that if
such issues were allowed to enter the
electoral or purina the whole arena of
public debate you might have a
recurrence it was called the crisis of
democracy 30 years ago that is the
effort by the Beast to enter the public
arena to put forth their own interests
and concerns and try to do something
about them that's called a crisis of
democracy and we can't let allow that to
take place again they have to leave
those matters to the people who call
themselves responsible men and who serve
private power and have to operate in
what the world bank calls technocratic
insulation not bothered by the Beast
that's the disease that caused such
alarm 30 years ago and it led to this
large-scale counter attack on many
different fronts
contain the Great Beast and to chip away
at the rights that had been recovered
sometimes institutionalized that's the
driving force of the so-called
neoliberal ideology of the last 25 years
it's recognized to have been
economically harmful but that's not
important even even by standard measures
of the long sophisticated ones but it's
been highly successful in reducing the
threat of democracy in a number of ways
one of them is simply to transfer
decisions into private hands then you
have to worry about the Beast can't do
anything about the privatization if
choices and decisions can be moved over
into the hands of unaccountable private
Pyrenees formal democracies finds it's
not a problem at all that's even good
you know it's a nice propaganda effect
and the financial liberalisation is
which set off this process 25 years ago
that has been well understood always to
be a method of undermining the options
for Democratic choice main reason why
capital controls were instituted in the
Bretton Woods agreements 50 years ago
dismantled 25 years ago and the general
shrinking of the public sector which is
a major thrust of social and economic
policy worldwide has the obvious effect
of undermining opportunities for
democracy effect and purpose surely it's
it's it is generally understood that on
economic issues on crucial economic
issues the ruler and the Beast tend to
be on opposite sides often and sharply
and therefore these issues just do not
arise in elections and it's very
revealing insight into the way the
country functions the political system
functions to see how rigorously this
principles maintain so take a look at a
couple of cases if you look at public
attitudes which are very closely
monitored in the United States you know
business wants to know what public's
thinking
propaganda one of the lead issues for
the public is the trade deficit that
ranks very high in public concerns and
it's easily understandable that
translates directly into loss of threats
to jobs loss of job security loss of job
quality people feel it right away in
contrast the trade deficit is a great
boon to corporations they love the
current issue of Foreign Affairs remain
establishment Journal explains as an
article explaining that it's unwise to
do something about the to try to do
something about the trade deficit for
example the trade deficit with mexico
where they describe it as formidable and
growing the reason is the following
slamming the door on mexican imports
means slamming the door on corporate
america two-thirds of the u.s. imports
from mexico are internal to corporations
that means they're not trade their
centrally managed interactions within
private attorneys and their affiliates
and that does create a huge deficit but
it's very beneficial to the producers
and very harmful to the working people
in the united states so therefore the
deficits a good thing you don't want to
slam the door on it or you'd be slamming
the door on corporate profits of course
working people consider this call trade
but not trade any more than the
transfers of you know from Illinois to
Indiana then returning to sell on this
is just centrally managed interactions
that happen to cross a border in fact if
you did a serious analysis of what is
legitimately called trade traditionally
you might find you'd be likely to find
the trade between the u.s. Mexico's
actually declines and snapped because
the proportion of it that centrally
managed is very sharply increased its
increased by about a third well working
people can look at the same phenomenon
and they see the effects and their jobs
that's particularly true when they know
even if the press won't record it that
the threat of job transfer has been
used as a very effective device for
union busting that happens to be illegal
but it's sanctioned by criminal state
that's been particularly true since the
Reagan years when the criminality was
quite overt and indeed discussed pretty
accurately the business press well
perhaps these arrangements even if
they're harmful to workers here are
helpful for Mexicans well unfortunately
that's not true either wages in Mexico
declined about twenty five percent since
NAFTA that includes a drop in
manufacturing wages that continues a
steady decline since around nineteen
eighty when the neoliberal reforms were
instituted poverty levels have been
going up fast right now they're going up
since NAFTA they're increasing about
twice as fast as a population growth
internally in Mexico powers
concentrating in a smaller smaller
sectors of consolidated big business
usually linked to the United States
smaller businesses like peasant
agriculture just can't compete with the
surge of highly subsidized high-tech
products exports coming in from the
United States well how does Mexico deal
with this well they have a huge export
family their population they're
exporting their population a lot of them
get killed on the way but some of them
make it they're exporting it here to
provide cheap labor to under
indescribable conditions to the United
States the consumption levels in the
United States are being subsidized by
the impoverishment of poor people of
working people peasants in in Mexico I'm
actually quoting from a recent study of
the Woodrow Wilson Center on this and
this is all expect to get worse for
Mexicans as the new government is
shifting the tax burden even more to the
poor taxes on food and medicine are
expected to be the main the largest
component
of new revenues that's a tax on the poor
of course these plans have aroused
considerable praise in the press here
hailing Mexico's new democracy well I'd
like to come back to the elections that
kind of hold off in your minds for a
minute the quite important issue of what
was kept out of the political arena I
want to get back to that let me take a
moment just to talk further about Mexico
it's kind of what happened there in the
last year's provide some useful
background and kind of a good
complementation to an understanding of
what's happening in the United States
and it's kind of a microcosm of what's
going on around the world in brief the
problem of repressing democracy and
dismantling right that's not a problem
confined to the United States it's a
global problem and has to be fought
globally major part of globalization if
you take a look blast the political
situation in the last 20 years in Mexico
there was a dramatic event the pre the
ruling dictatorship was overthrown in
the last election and that was quite an
achievement of the Mexican people here
it's tributed largely to NAFTA it's one
of the great successes of NAFTA but take
a closer look what happened is actually
quite different and interesting what
happened is that 20 years ago Mexico
fell into a very sharp economic crisis a
large part of the responsibility for
that crisis lies in the hands of the IMF
and the World Bank who were exerting
enormous pressure on Mexico to continue
borrowing and on banks to continue
lending and they continued the borrowing
lending pressure right up to the moment
of crash within a couple of weeks of the
crash they were still publishing
learning documents about how wonderful
it was withdrew them quickly after the
crash the standard then came a huge
increase in interest rates in the United
States the folker repression of the lake
Carter early Reagan years which was the
first stage in neoliberal policy here
the domestic policy well right after the
crisis Mexico initiated under
sure what are called neoliberal reforms
and they led to a lot of as always they
lived a lot of popular resistance and
activism that's common by 1988 the
situation was becoming pretty serious in
fact in 1988 the presidential election
was apparently won by a party of the
left fact the dictatorship was
maintained only with massive electoral
fraud notice this was all long before
and after and that aroused concern in
the United States in nineteen ninety two
years after the election which was just
barely saved for the right two years
after the election there was a Latin
American strategy development workshop
in Washington which considered all of
this they concluded that US relations
with this murderous and corrupt Mexican
dictatorship were in their words
extraordinarily positive but they did
see a problem there was a cloud on the
horizon they were thinking of the
1980-88 election here give it in their
words a democracy opening could test the
special relationship by bringing into
office a government more interested in
challenging the United States on
economic and nationalist grounds and
that's dangerous so what do you do with
that that's unacceptable it's been
unacceptable for a long time it's
important to realize how little things
change since 1945 the US policy towards
Latin America altogether has been based
on a document called the economic
charter for the Americas that was
imposed on the hemisphere in February
1945 at a meeting called by the united
states in Mexico the Charter the u.s.
imposed charter called for an end to
economic nationalism in all its forms we
now have state department records
revealing what they were thinking about
they were concerned Washington was
concerned that goal was to cut off what
it called the new nationalism taking
root in Latin America which embraces
policies designed to bring about a
broader
tribution of wealth and to raise the
standard of living of the masses they
were concerned that Latin Americans are
convinced that the first beneficiaries
of the development of a country's
resources should be the people of that
country and that of course will never do
those are our resources as leading
planner George Kennan put it we got to
protect them first the first
beneficiaries of a country's resources
have to be US investors that's the
Charter and that's the way it's been
ever since the history of the US and
latin america for the last 50 years has
largely been one of beating down any
threat of the new nationalism every time
it arose in the 1980s it was arising in
mexico and i couldn't be tolerated well
what was done what was done was to
employ a device which was openly
described as it as an effort to lock
Mexico into the conditions of the
charter of the Americas lock Mexico into
the reform so cool by a trade agreement
that's nasty it locks them into the
reforms we don't worry about the
democracy opening and any challenge a
NAFTA of course is unbreakable for
Mexico it's an agreement that they can't
break the United States can break any
kind of likes for example the Clinton
administration has brokered by stroke of
the pen to ban Mexican tomatoes at the
request of Florida growers on the open
grounds that American consumers US
consumers preferred the Mexican product
so therefore it had to be banned us can
do that Mexico can simple mission issue
of power at the time of NAFTA there was
no issue of Paris so almost nothing to
do with free trade Mexico already had
the lowest tariffs among developing
countries before not but the investor
rights provisions of the NAFTA agreement
they are important they ensure that
there won't be any threat of
a democracy opening and that being the
case formal democracy can now be
tolerated even applauded while Mexico
falls deeper into ruin except for the
more privileged sectors the Mexican
wealthy and their US counterparts they
can rejoice in the fairytale economy
that they reclaim well let's come back
finally to the US elections of november
two thousand these us-mexico
interactions which are mislabeled trade
they were off the agenda for the usual
reason the tyrant and the Great Beast
were on opposite sides the same was true
of a much more significant agenda item
namely the so-called free trade area of
the Americas which is a generalization
of the an extension of the economic
charter of 1945 that's a great concern
to the population of the United States
or to be more precise it would be of
great concern to them if they'd ever
heard about it and therefore they must
not hear about it we know that the
issues in it or a great concern but not
the agreement because people don't know
about that so they can't be concerned
about it and that's an important that's
quite important the FDA did not come up
in the elections nobody mentioned it
just as similarly no meaningful
discussion of NAFTA was tolerated in
1992 right before the elections it's an
interesting story which is still
suppressed but for the FTA a clear
enough take a look back notice nobody
discussed it FDA a had been under
negotiation for several years by trade
ministers who are representatives of
corporations and by the corporation's
the media have known all about it but
they also know that it's necessary to
keep it quiet chief avail of silence
over it just as in the case of NAFTA or
the multilateral agreement on
investments and the reason is understood
actually explained pretty frankly in the
business press the wall street journal
for example
pointed out that opponents of these
agreements have what they called an
ultimate weapon namely the population
Great Beast again therefore silences
mandatory can't let that weapon be
unsheath actually the journal made these
comments when it was lamenting the
failure of fast-track it was beaten back
under popular pressure a couple years
ago and is now considered the highest
priority actually bipartisan priority
the as it's pointed out it's necessary
for what's called trade enhancement in
fact it's now been relabeled as it
traded enhancement initiative the sense
correct the issue is whether trade
agreements so-called trade agreements
which remember have very little to do
with trade whether trade agreements
investor rights agreements should be
handled democratically or whether they
should be handled in the Stalinist style
that is the Kremlin makes a decision and
the Duma says yes that's the choice and
there's an overwhelming consensus close
to unanimity that it has to be done
Stalinist style that's fast tracked the
and there's a simple reason for that if
there is any opening to the public the
ultimate weapon will come out again
you'll never be able to rama through the
issue has nothing to do with trade as do
with democracy i'm the most passionate
advocate of free trade would be opposed
to these arrangements the Stalinist
style arrangements called fast-track if
they happen to think that democracy was
a good idea since they don't they are
unanimously in favor of the Stalinist
style the issue does have to do with
free trade trade and a you know football
trade and a special sense that's the
only way to ran through the investor
rights agreements and it's understood so
therefore fast-track is necessary and we
also are enjoying to keep to the
Newspeak terminology of free trade and
trade enhancement it notice that these
issues about the FDA did break through
to the world at least excluding the
United States at the Porto Alegre world
Social Forum in January that was kept
out of the US press but known elsewhere
and it broke through to the general
public in the United States as well in
April at the Quebec summit of the
Americas that's thanks to the tens of
thousands of activists there who were
very harshly condemned and rightly
because they were departing from good
form they were enabling the Great Beast
to find out something about what's
happening to and that's not allowed
there was enough turmoil and the summit
at the Quebec that the Masters had to do
something about it they did they issued
a very stirring to call for a democracy
and transparency and that received the
big press front-page stories about this
great event and commentators were
greatly impressed and that in a sense
rightly the declaration was at least as
impressive as Stalin's Constitution
which was taken about it seriously by
the commissars is this is taken by our
guys namely very seriously because on
both sides they do take it seriously
it's ingrained support for for power no
hypocrisy if you want to know how
seriously other people should take it
just have a look at what happened the
Proceedings of the meetings were secret
the text that's being discussed is kept
secret that's in the interests of what's
called transparency ultimately it'll be
stuck on the web somewhere and that
means that you know in principle
everybody in the country those about it
you know like the way you know about
some mother arcane matter if you know
how to look the corporate lawyers who
wrote it of course they know all about
so that's transparency actually the
meetings were discussed honestly in as
far as I could see one newspaper the
major business newspaper in the world
the London Financial Times they even had
a report that on the one opening that
was made to civil what's called civil
society the leaders that they did
in the interests of democracy allows
civil society to enter the discussion
there was a sardonic report of it in the
Financial Times they had a side session
in which people will they said well
dressed academics with ties and jackets
were allowed to come in and make three
minute presentations and then sit down
but the reporter said well we can't tell
you what they said because the press was
kicked out of the meeting in the
interest of transparency so that was
democracy there was a huge publicity for
President Bush's major speech in which
he talked about the wonders of NAFTA and
how this should be a model for the FTAA
well what are the wonders of NAFTA there
were two major publications on this that
were timed for release for the summit
both by organizations that are not
physically obscure one was human rights
watch the main International Human
Rights monitor the other was the
economic policy institute in washington
which is a standard economic analysis
Institute the Human Rights Watch report
was on labor rights under NAFTA and it
concluded that they have deteriorated
significantly primarily because the
three governments crucially the US
government were trying not even not only
not adhering to the wording but trying
to undermine it so that's the first
report the second report by the economic
policy institute was a close analysis of
the effects of NAFTA in all three
countries and showing that in all three
countries the for working people that
means the large majority the results
were harmful that's pretty hard to find
an agreement which is harmful for
everybody concerned except of course the
wealthy sectors who not only did enrich
themselves but also succeeded in the
larger purpose of undermining democratic
and developments and rights well those
two major reports were on every news
disk they were released for the summit
and they were reported they were
reported in the Financial Times and to
be honest there was actually an op-ed in
one local newspaper in the United States
these consequences are pretty much as
were predicted they were predicted by
Congress
his own research agency the office of
Technology Assessment in 1992 when they
did an analysis of NAFTA and the
executive version predicted that it was
going to have these effects and offered
an alternative they were also predicted
by the labor movement which came out
with a long study at the same time of
about the same sort neither of these
studies were ever allowed into the
discussion they've never been mentioned
this day in 1992 again in the interests
of democracy and transparency the
central issue at Quebec and the FDA is
what's called the agreement on trade and
services the word trade is put in there
to sort of sneak it into these
agreements then I can do with trade
services is a name that refers to any
just about anything that might be in the
public arena so education health
environmental issues you know resource
control energy any of that stuff that's
all services things that governments do
you know that people are supposed to
have some say in a democratic society
and that has to be eliminated you have
to transfer that to the private arena to
private hand on there are various
devices for doing this interesting ones
if that can be done then the hemisphere
can be locked into a very harsh version
of the charter of the Americas now much
more explicit in detail than it was 45
years at 50 years ago 55 years ago and
if that can be done and that's the goal
then you can really allow the Great
Beast back into the public arena because
there won't be anything to do it'll be
essentially closed it will be in the
hands of unaccountable private power and
therefore democracy can flourish without
any crises well it's easy enough to
continue with all of this a lot of more
examples if you want more but there's
enough the developments are not at all
surprising they are exactly what you
should expect they're not even novel the
modalities of course are always changing
but the general thrust is always the
same and as in the past they are not
likely to be successful haven't been
successful in the past
won't be now there is a cycle clear
cycle of progress and regression over
time the cycle is generally upward as
rights are recovered and established and
instituted and there's no reason to
expect this to change if it does come to
an end that's the end of human
civilization and there's really no
reason to let that happens if that
quietly and watch it professor Chomsky
with the function of incarceration right
now and a good guess as to the answer
comes from the timing so this process of
the pie now is everybody here knows the
United States is just off the world
spectrum on this it's a like five to ten
times as high as any other industrial
country and I think probably world
champion by now in per capita
incarceration and it has not you do with
crime you know I mean the US has been if
you take a look at other comparable
societies like 20 years ago the US was
sort toward the high end but not off the
spectrum the and that remains true
nothing's changed so has nothing to do
with crime what what has happened in the
last 20 25 years well what's happened
what the most striking thing that's
happened is what I've just been
discussing neoliberal reforms and the
counter-attack against the democratizing
stabilizing tendencies of the sixties
and later there's been a major attack i
discussed a number of them and this
happens coincide with it's from the late
70s you know the when the the reagan
programs are actually instituted in the
late Carter years and then extended
under intense fight under Reagan during
that period that's the period when
incarceration goes up and we all know
how it goes up yeah it goes up by
inventing crimes mostly victimless
crimes so if a kid in Roxbury is found
with a joint in his pocket
end up in jail for years and notice
these are very carefully crafted primes
like for example the peak use of
marijuana I think was about late 70s
sometime but that was a low point in
incarceration and the reason is you know
folks like us you know like our children
you don't go and throw them in jail just
like you don't go to the suburb where I
live in Boston and go into somebody's
home and take out an executive snorting
coke can throw him in jail the police
tried to do that they'd be in jail you
know but if you go down to the slums
downtown yeah sure then you can do it
and it's easy nothing and that's the way
you control would have been always been
called the dangerous classes the
neoliberal period has one of its
properties is it makes a lot of people's
preference you know for most of the
population wages and incomes kind of
stagnant incomes kind of are maintained
but that's because working hours are
going way up the USS by far the highest
workload in the world by now past Japan
a couple years ago but so you can
maintain you know you can maintain
incomes by very intensive work but
benefits have declined court systems
we're always weekend of decline wages
are declining and for the poor actually
declining and many people there is no
place for well what you would throw in
jail it has many advantages for one
think it gets rid of people you know you
know I mean you do with people are
superfluous for another thing it's a
it's a very good way of frightening
everybody else so fear of crime is very
high in the United crime is not very
high but fear of crime is very high and
stimulated artificially stimulated the
United States one of the very maybe the
only country where being tough on
criminals is an important feature of
running for office most places crime
exists considered a problem probably try
to deal with you mainly here it's
something that you use
to show how tough you are just like
having the death sentence which is
considered an abomination virtually the
entire world and all of these are very
carefully focused they're focused on the
dangerous classes the people who are
superfluous everybody else gets
frightened it increases racism attention
as lots of helpful benefits it's even an
economic benefit so by now the scale of
what Randy Sheldon and others have
called the crime control industry the
scale of it is not the Pentagon you know
but it's substantial that's a
substantial industry that even interest
high tech industry because they can
produce complicate high-tech
surveillance devices and things it
interests the the major financial
institutions because they can float big
loans for prison construction it's a
it's a big employer in fact if we were
there there has just been a little while
ago the first major study over saying of
the effect of incarceration unemployment
it turns out you take these two million
people who are in jail most of you know
overwhelmingly black males of working
age you know to work for you I suppose
you put them you count them back in the
workforce well you know us unemployment
rates go up to almost two percent
already contrary to a lot of fabrication
us unemployment rates are not very
different from say Western Europe a
little lower but not very much lower
there within the spectrum you add this
in there very well within the range of
other countries and that's an under
estimate because that's only counting
the prisoners suppose you count the rest
of the what's ludicrously called the
criminal justice system if you count the
rest of it you know the guards the
police the lawyers the judges you know
that whole huge apparatus what's a large
number of people taken away from
productive occupations you throw if you
count them as unemployed I mean they
ought to be counted
negatively employed if you were such a
measure but if you count them as
unemployed which would at least be fair
then you know you have a pretty high
unemployment in the United States but
this is kind of masked you know and from
many points of view it's a highly
effective I can't see any other reason
for it certainly is not in do it getting
with dealing with crime it's kind of
like the you know the bombing peasants
and Colombia nothing to do with
producing you know dealing with drugs in
the United States nothing so ever
everybody knows it it's a modality of
counterinsurgency the here it's a
domestic version population control if
there's another reason I can't figure
out what it is furthermore it's
understood you know like when the drug
war was the last phase of the drug war
was called about 15 years ago in the
late 80s there is one of the one senator
and my favorite person but he does pay
attention to social statistics Daniel
Moynihan he social science he pointed
out right away he said look if we passed
this drug law we are deciding to have a
crime wave among minorities and it was
clear you know you just take a look at
the social statistics and think about
how policing works yeah that's exactly
what they were deciding to do exactly
what they did generated a crime wave and
then impose harsh penalties for the
crimes that were invented you see the
possibility for empowerment of
minorities through the normal protocol
voter registration and general weirdness
crazy well for one thing I think we
should bear in mind that it's the
empowerment of the majority that we
should be concerned with it's the
majority of the population that's out of
the system you know it's over half the
population who says they feel powerless
okay it's seventy-five percent of the
population who say the elections on vain
do with them now the big question is
what about empowerment of the majority
and attack all the measures that I've
been talking about our efforts to I
think should be understood as efforts to
disempower the majority while
maintaining formal processes of
electoral function but you're right the
the more deprived sectors of the
population are the most disempowered as
you'd expect so sure you all know one of
the effects of the incarcerate just the
incarceration alone which is very
racially painted you know we all know
that one of the effects is to
disenfranchise very large numbers of
black voters mostly men but increasingly
women during the clinton-gore years
alone about 600,000 more people were put
in jail that's a approximately a little
over almost a third of the total number
now those people are disenfranchised
while they're in jail and because of the
crazed punitive elements of the u.s.
system that many of them are
disenfranchised forever oh those votes
alone since they overwhelmingly both
Democratic would have easily swung the
election to the Democrats but they
preferred to throw people in jail rather
than to win the election and in Florida
and just in Florida alone you know just
the prison forgetting all the illegal
you know keeping people off the lists
and all this kind of crazy so forgetting
all of that stuff just the straight
incarceration was enough to swing the
election that's a pre core element of
disempowerment and it goes well beyond
it because it shows up and everything
else you know like if you're
living in a under conditions of
deprivation and impoverishment and if
you don't have an organized basis to
resist like you don't have labor unions
young militant labor unions and other
popular organizations that enable who
are people to resist then you
disempowered even if you're allowed to
push a button once every couple of years
you have nothing to do with what's
happening and people know it um I'm
interested to hear what your thoughts
and feelings are about the emergence of
a new mass activist movement that we saw
in seattle and washington quebec what
your thoughts of it given everything
that you've been talking about and in
particular what things you think would
be very strategic to focus on for this
movement well I mean the you know the
popular movements for one thing we
should bear in mind that we have a
slightly skewed picture of them here
they've been going they've been going on
in a massive scale in the third world
for years I mean that doesn't really
break through to consciousness here but
if you take a look at India and Brazil
places like that they've got huge mass
movements which have been very active
and effective on the reason the world
social forum was held in Porto Alegre in
Brazil is because that's an area of
Brazil that has been under the political
leadership of the Workers Party you know
the biggest social democratic labour
based party in the world and the most
militant 14 years the landless workers
movement in Brazil has hundreds of
thousands of people who take gland you
know there's your very serious movement
one of the most important that may be
the most important popular movement in
the world in India has been huge
demonstrations against the World Trade
Organization rules and others major
strikes and so on that stuff never kind
of reaches the consciousness of the
North because just you know a lot of
those poor people but when it gets to
something like Seattle then yet it
into consciousness then you get it's
happening right here so can't ignore and
what was it had already reached the
consciousness of the business world a
couple of years earlier when the mass
popular movements were able to beat back
the multilateral agreement on investment
in 1998 I was a major victory you know
and talked about in public much except
in the business press but it was really
striking how activists around the world
without any resources or organization
were able to beat back the most powerful
concentration of the greatest
concentration of power in world history
trying to ram through an investor rights
agreement they had to back off they're
not trying to sneak it back in in the
FPAA and other things the and now yes
from in the major public demonstrations
it's just impossible to ignore so as I
mentioned that Quebec it was the first
time that the free trade area the
Americas ever did reach a minimal amount
of public awareness of course it still
totally distorted mostly secret but
something at least yeah these popular
movements are you know that's the way
people respond to repression correctly
and it's the right way to do it and they
kind of a huge effect it I mean there is
repression like you know wasn't pleasant
to be in the streets of Seattle or
Quebec but it's compared with but most
people in the world face not a lot and
for people like us here you know people
with any degree of privilege in the West
it's very limited repression but
comparative standards so you have an
enormous amount of freedom to do things
and you know it should be in this
country should be in the organizers
powered paradise you have a country
where most of the population feels
powerless most of the population feels
repressed you know the you know that's
just a paradise for organizers for
people who want to educate and organize
they ought to be they ought to become a
force which can take over the you know
take over power and
their own conditions of course has to
happen you know and that doesn't happen
by magic happens by hard work what are
the issues there ought to be focused on
I mean there's a lot of them that I
mentioned the FTAA that's not the only
one I mean there is an attempt right
here to dismantle just about every
achievement of every achievement of
Rights that has been gained so let's
take Social Security there is nobody's
in doubt at the moment that there's an
effort to dismantle that Social Security
system and it's again bipartisan and
it's understood why the Social Security
if you can dismantle Social Security for
one thing it's a huge bonanza for Wall
Street that means trillions of dollars
for Wall Street managers to play around
with but I know that's discussed I think
they're more important reason there is
in the back of the scam pure scam about
a social security crisis I mean I'm to
bother talking about it's complete
fabrication and if to the extent that
was any problem there trivial ways of
dealing with in there isn't a problem
but the the the reasons for it are
pretty deep I think so for if you just
think about the consequences of
privatizing Social Security one
consequence is that it turns working
people into it forces working people to
be opposed to their own interest very
strikingly if you're a future you know
your security for the future depends on
the stock market you must be in favor of
a deal aber measures and measures to
destroy the environment and anything
else that's going to raise per stock
prices you have to be you have to be
dedicated to opposing your own interests
and the interests of your grandchildren
say because that's what environmental
issues are about now you know that's a
brilliant technique of social control to
condemn to force people just a minute
choices you know to be strongly opposed
to their own interests and the interests
of their children and their
grandchildren it's pretty hard to think
of a better
ice of social control and that's
privatizing Social Security that's what
it does another thing that it does is it
undermines this dangerous feeling that
people have that they should care about
somebody else like you should care
whether the disabled widow cross town
can as food to eat well that's Social
Security says you care about that you're
not supposed to care about that in fact
if you you know you study the ideology
you're supposed to be what's called a
rational wealth Maximizer meaning you
should only be concerned with maximizing
your own commodity consumption period
that's called being rational somebody
from Mars was looking at it they would
call it being pathologically insane but
that's what's called rational and that's
what we're taught to be it's driven into
your head from infancy and things like
Social Security are they countered that
you know they're based on the principle
that you care about someone else it's
the same flaw that the public school
system has public school system is based
on the idea that you care whether the
kid down the street goes to school and
that's a really bad idea you know that's
got to be driven out of people's minds
like any normal human sentiment has to
be driven out of their minds if they're
going to be controlled so there I think
there are real reasons for these attacks
on the public sector that that's why it
doesn't really matter if they harm
economic growth is they typically do
because it's not important they're much
more important goals what should we be
doing well you know countering all of
this in fact you know I mean the weight
if you want to privatize some system
there's a standard technique you want to
privatize the railroads in England first
thing you do is defund them so they're a
Rick you know and then nobody can stand
them anymore so then you can drive
through privatization all people say
okay and that's that's the standard
technique for taking anything out of the
public arena the arena democratic
control a defunded you no harm at so
more work and then people
can't stand it and we want to get rid of
it yeah so the same here defund the
public schools try to manufacture a
social security crisis even though there
isn't any you know every area you can
think of health environment whatever
that's the way to do it and then yeah
people will be willing to say well hand
it over to some private tyranny well you
know this is exactly what people
shouldn't what anybody who wants to keep
a civilized society should be working
against this by the only means there are
by educational organization
