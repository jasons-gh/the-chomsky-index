libertarian throughout modern European
history men socialist anarchist
we're not the auntie's and the Socialist
Movement the workers movement and
socialist movement I sort of broke into
two branches roughly one statist one adi
stages the statist branch led to
Bolshevism and Lenin and Trotsky and so
on the ADI stages branch which included
Marxists left Marxists Rosa Luxemburg
others it's kind of merged more or less
into an amount of them with big strain
of anarchism into what was called
libertarian socialism so and libertarian
in Europe always meant socialists here
it means all for the King Randor Cato
Institute or something like that but
that's a special us you see the u.s.
sense is quite different here every word
has become has taken on the not the
opposite of its meaning elsewhere so
here libertarian means extreme advocate
of total tyranny that's what libertarian
means here it means power ought to be
given into the hands of private
unaccountable tyrannies even worse than
state tyrannies because there the public
has some kind of rule the corporate
system especially as its evolved in the
20th century is purity completely
unaccountable you're inside one of these
institutions you take orders from above
you hand it down below you're outside
the institutions under what the
libertarians want there's nothing you
can say tyrannies do what they feel like
they're global and scale I mean this is
the extreme opposite of what's been
called libertarian everywhere in the
world since the Enlightenment and that's
what's called libertarian
