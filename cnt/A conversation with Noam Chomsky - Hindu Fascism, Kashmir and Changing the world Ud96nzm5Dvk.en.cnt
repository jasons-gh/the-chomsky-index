okay so one thing under talked about is
you know what about the how much you
know what what's going on in the world
in terms of we seem that right-wing the
rise of right-wing and fascist groups in
different countries how much do you
think that in a way people's minds are
being fractured into thinking about you
know that particular country or the
particular tribe in a very narrow way
and how much do you think these
fractures are the result of the fissures
of the past well there's many factors
each history
there's some pretty common factors I
think somebody closed one crucial factor
in the United States
it's just socio-economic promises that
have been introduced since basically
organization undermining of public
service is diminishing the role of the
state
transferring it turns free will thing
control to private hands so we take on
the effects of pretty obvious there's
been a very sharp concentration of will
pretty much stagnation
the majority of the population by now in
the United States and 0.1% have over 20
percent of the wealth that's the
population as negative net worth of
madison's people just doing
the real wages in the United States have
about the same purchasing power they
have the nineteen seventies sharp
concentration of wills automatically
leads to decline of functioning
democracy
power
so you in Europe it's been exacerbated
even further but the structure which
essentially makes takes a decision
making over major issues away from the
national states to an unelected
bureaucracy they've been following
austerity policies which makes the view
of the gruel policies even worse money
ticularly the sex of all of this
angry resentment bitterness condemnation
of the centrist political institutions
- that's fertile territory for
demagogues it's the kind of situation in
which should some that I could come
try to turn these anger do you know that
brings up I certainly you know see your
point
I you know about the decimation of
people's aspirations in life
and I and I see that and I recently in
the last couple of years I got in all
the playing guitar and it's a very
loving community but I see some of my or
a lot more talented musicians that me
and I can see that I can see that there
is an underlying struggle that they are
going through but but you know but they
still but they still are very good at
heart and they and they maintain their
humanity so the reason I bring that up
is because you're seeing decimation of
the middle class here but I see an
attempt by people to hold on to the
finality you know but that to me being
somebody who's comes from a lower middle
class my dad's a teacher we're not in
India I'm seeing that the Indian middle
class sure India's a poor country really
poor country but actually as an
exception from the neoliberal pants the
middle class have gained in power and
wealth in the last 20 years but what
you're saying you're saying what is the
reason that they are what is the reason
that they are supporting these awful
Hindu fascist regimes you know with you
do you have any thoughts on that
I don't think it's true that the middle
class is getting us it's being it's
basically stagnated
so as I say
United States
that's basically they know
I mean and the anger kind of can be
exploited by somebody like try to turn
and say it's not beautiful
works
was
bori doesn't say anything turn the
concerns to extreme
but that is the point I wanted to touch
base on your eye I see the general
dynamics of what you're saying of what
was happened when I portal II agree with
you that it is true in the United States
although although you know in India I
think it's a more complicated picture
innocence that the poor have become
poorer but the party middle class of the
middle class I D so that is one so the
high tech sectors
skilled people who are involved in
engineering that's a spiritual sector in
the population they take farmers there's
literally hundreds of thousands of
suicides
I yes I totally agree with you on what
is going on with the rural sector oh
that you know the breathing well where
there is is between the engineers and
between the farmers there is another
sector like for example you brought up
teachers the teachers in the cities and
in the and the the wealthier states they
have also benefited it is it is I
believe it as a fact that they have
benefited from the neoliberal policies
in terms of because because the state
has become the government has become
wealthier and more powerful and and so
the the sectors the sector's in terms of
the schoolteachers and in terms of in
terms of that they have increase in I I
cannot I can I do not have I do not have
quantitative data but I can I can state
from I can state from my personal
observations given that my dad is a
given my dad is a teacher that certainly
certainly we teachers today can make in
in a in a place like Chennai for example
they can make something like you know 40
50 60 thousand rupees a month which you
know you could not aspire to anywhere
close 30 years ago so that is just the
country is much
absolutely absolutely so yeah I agree
with you on auntie on the increasing
inequality there's no the economic
conditions that you point out certainly
certainly have validity however one
aspect I wanted to talk about is we
example he brought up about the aspect
of you know people being people being
convinced that it's the white demagogues
tell it's the other Pakistan or Mexicans
or some other enemy who's taking things
from us there it also has a certain
certain history of ignorance in the
sense that even even during the sixties
of the seventies even during the
communist times when Congress was the
height of its power Pakistan was always
presented as an enemy - Pakistan was
always resented and Kashmir was always
presented as something they just belong
to India so so there is nothing more
than just the economics at play as
giving talks
they happened to mention it
I believe that that was the first talk
of yours that I attended and I believe
your thought was in October of 2001 or
somewhere in late 2001 because I
remember having an emails conversation
with you subsequently but yeah a
cashmere effect the support for what he
did just didn't touch me right and I
think that is more than economics I
think that is also there is the the
fissures that there is as the the minds
of people have already been fired by by
ignorance and propaganda and a way
there's a certain conditioning that has
already happened what in this happens is
the first
yep no I'm just gonna check the camera
to make sure that it is recording
because I have very poor habits in terms
of handling that machine so okay I'm
sorry
so 15 so you indicated not system it's
not what we are seeing and so you
indicated in some recent interviews that
what we're seeing in the world is not
not system but even though that there
are parallels but it's not exactly it's
not exactly what happened in Germany
would you say that that is true in in
the case of India because India is
building detention centers to house
millions of Muslim citizens after
leaving labeling them illegal immigrants
who were seen as many as the symptoms of
fascism but without the ideology fascism
meant something it meant a powerful
state under the control of which
controlled everything even control the
business
and we're not seeing the state does not
control of big business
I see I think that in the same here you
have many of the aspects of
concentration of business I think I see
that sense of stage is so powerful that
it controls not just labor of course
they're signs of orders every company to
get out of China so do you think well so
I you know two questions the first one
you know
so the did you notice that in India in
Kashmir
you know pitch number on who's the
mister pitch number with the former Home
Minister of India and he he was when he
was the Home Minister is a communist
politician as a home minister he was
administering the popular he was
administering the occupation of Kashmir
it was brutal but not as terrible as it
is today but it was still brutal but
then he was administering the
occupations
right under Congress it was massive
atrocities but does it strike you that
he was he was celebrated the you know
maybe maybe you can maybe you you maybe
it brings you some other examples in the
world that he was celebrated when he was
administering the occupation of Kashmir
but the moment he criticized the BJP
occupation of Kashmir and the moment he
called it out as reducing Kashmir into a
whistle state moment he criticized it
now he's been in prison without charges
yes well I mean the whole institutional
structure of India plus mass of the
population that Kashmir is a whole
Khruschev do you think it is to restore
a decent of some type of a decent
government in this country in order to
in order to support struggles like the
struggles of the people of Kashmir Oh
important do you think it is to have a
government in this country in this event
that that is you know that is supportive
of you know that is that is more
centrist or more center-left or you know
not not not not having fascist
undertones how important do you think is
to have a government like that support
struggles suppose struggles abroad if
you look at the record the more liberal
governments have by no means supported
movements for your freedom injustice
almost anywhere they support freedom
movements in enemy states and there I
like in other countries who support
Obama you look at the refugees fleeing
from Central America for a time it may
still be true the plurality we're coming
from Honduras why because in 2009 there
was a military coup in Honduras that
throughout a mildly reformist president
stood out turned into it our story what
we love what we dig in in the in in the
United States for people living here and
others for helping struggles like the
struggles for freedom on Kashmir and
Palestine it would take major popular
movements and their heart to construct
the of the worst crime since Second
World War was the invasion of Vietnam
took years before you
get any popular breakfast on a minute in
Boston
pretty liberal city that we literally
couldn't have public demonstrations
against the war because they would be
broken up by counter demonstrators until
about 1967 by that time Vietnam
effectively destroyed other things like
that worked for many years I'm trying to
get some positions of the Indonesian
invasion of East Timor he's the worst
genocide since the second boat finally
happened took about twenty five years
that the US was backing it the whole
time
Franco takes a turkey in the 1990s
Turkey was carrying out massive
repression and slaughter of Kurds almost
entirely backed by the Clinton
administration was all the arms are
coming from Clinton couldn't get any
reporting and you couldn't get any
phrases to this day
it's not so you mentioned about the
Kurds whoa
so you know what is you know with this I
know you were against impeaching
impeaching focusing on impeachment with
regard to the Russia investigation and
you know with regards to the new
situations that's developed in terms of
in terms of in terms of Ukraine and and
that would you do you think the there is
a lot of excitement in it in democratic
circles about what impeachment nor do
you think that it is do you think that
that is a do you think it's a good idea
to focus victim on impeachment take a
look at the issues in the impeachment
hearing what is the crime that's being
charged that he was looking for dirt on
Democrats he was attacking the power
system
the same with working the cried the
major crimes of nobody cared about
he broke he had a bunch of thugs break
into the Democratic Party headquarters
you don't attack powerful people like
this they fight back but the major
crimes right I mean in a way it seemed
that the Walter or what happens with the
Kurds and that is not a reason for
impeachment that's a lot of it it's like
when people continue to say Lindsey
Graham the mothers condemned him for
throwing the courage to the mercy of the
Turks what they're saying is this is
gonna harm the fight against Isis does
it also strike you that Lindsey Graham
the senator that we just mentioned and
others also compared withdrawal from the
Kurdish areas to withdrawal from Iraq
which is you know so to the to the to
comparisons make sense when Saddam
Hussein was carrying out chemical
warfare attacks against
kurz didn't write the Reagan
administration supported they tried to
blame it on a rat when Congress tried to
pass some resolution criticizing the
Kurds
smash betrayed them over
Kissinger radiant
right
No No thank you for your time good to
see you good to see you
