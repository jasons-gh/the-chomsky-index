you've identified from a young age as an
anarchist and during that time the
popularity of anarchism has fallen and
risen and I wonder if your core
philosophy your anarchism has evolved or
changed during the course of your life
well it's not what it was when I was 10
years old that's fundamentally not but
that's because the core philosophy just
seems to be like common sense I don't
see how anybody can not accept so now
the core the core principles as far as I
understand it that I'm the anarchism
covers an extremely wide range and all
sorts of you can you can't encapsulate
it in formulas but it seems me there is
a sort of a thread that runs through it
and it is basically skepticism about any
form of authority or domination or
submission whatever the idea basic idea
is that domination and hierarchy are not
self justifying they have to justify
themselves as a burden of proof the beer
and if they can't justify themselves
they should be dismantled and that
covers everything from personal
relations to international affairs and
then out of that coming various
varieties of anarchism depending on
exactly you're looking for in the future
what do you what are the alternatives to
Authority and so on but was never the
decent and human life seems to fall
under that so now that hasn't changed
well the part the tendency of anarchism
which I guess you subscribe to of
anarcho-syndicalism overlaps fairly
closely with council communism around
this notion of worker councils and for
the public at large the assumption is
that an anarchist society would be one
where people ran amok where there is
chaos
what would that's the propaganda then
nij anarchist views were mostly highly
organized societies so what would that
society look like a society of worker
councils a worker councils I think it
should be one component of it so it
means in any institution it's a
university or factory or whatever it is
the participants would run it it run it
through councils in which people
participate and make decisions and you
not sound like a faculty which was about
as close to this model as you get in the
narrow world where it's you know there
are outside controls but pretty much the
faculty makes decisions about what
happens internally I see one of the
things about that makes university life
appealing much more so than higher paid
professions is that you're running your
own life to a large extent under their
work duties but they're technically
especially shared and shared by common
agreement and you may decide to work 80
hours a week but it's the ADRC you pick
and it's the topics that you choose to
work on and the it comes out with coming
an inner need residence
external compulsion and I think that's
the kind of model everything should turn
towards so worker councils would be one
component of a freely organized society
but they'd have to interact with others
so in institutions a factory liberties
is in a community and the community
should have a comparable form of
self-organization and self-management
and then they have to interact and it's
complex interactions because many people
are parts of a lot of them and as an
anarchist society the kind of I think is
desirable would develop it would have to
deal with quite concrete problems about
the nature of self-government the nature
of administration do you want to
distribute jobs so that they're fixed
certain what circulation of
responsibilities and actions and there's
no simple answer to that like you want
people to be trained as surgeons let's
say on the other hand you don't want all
the dirty work done by a special
category of people so that has to be
worked a distribution of job functions
and interactions between different forms
of which should be voluntary Association
and there are many other problems like
what happens if somebody doesn't want to
be part of it take on the
responsibilities of a community those
are problems exist in any society and
they would exist in a different forum in
a more free society and at this point
you have lots of different ideas so
there are people basically anarchists to
think that pay payment what you earn
from your work should be proportional to
effort there are others who think that's
not an appropriate model that it should
be independent of effort can't believe
the latter but most my friends stand
over the phone or so but these are real
questions in their innumerable ones well
thinking about the road to a stateless
society in a Turkish society you've
written that you believe that radicals
should defend those gains which have
been fought for by people that are
embodied in the state such as social
security such as progressive taxation
other anarchists might argue that this
holds people within the kind of paternal
paternalistic grip of the state
why do you come down where you do on
this if that's what the alternatives are
I mean many anarchists just consider the
state the fundamental form of oppression
I think that's a mistake moment of the
various kinds of oppressive institutions
that exist the state is among the least
of them the state at least to the extent
of the societies Democratic various
degrees and types but to the extent that
it's democratic you have some influence
on what happens in the state you have no
influence on what happens in the
corporation they're real tyrannies and
as long as society is largely dominated
by private tyrannies which is the worst
form of oppression people just need some
form of self-defense and the state
provides some form of self-defense so to
say well let's dismantle social security
means concretely let's decide that that
disabled Widow
across town starve to death and I'll
agree with it
