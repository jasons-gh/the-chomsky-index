the war and peace report
I'm Amy Goodman as we continue the hour
with world renowned linguist political
dissident Noam Chomsky who spoke last
night here in Boston at the Old South
Church I want to make a couple of
remarks below about the severe
difficulty of maintaining and
instituting democracy the powerful
forces that have always opposed that the
the achievements of somehow salvaging
and enhancing it and the significance of
that for the future of it first a couple
of words about the challenges that we
face which you heard enough about
already and you all know about I don't
have to go into them in detail to
describe these challenges as extremely
severe would be an error of the phrase
does not capture the enormity of the
kinds of challenges that lie ahead
and any serious discussion of the future
of humanity must begin by recognizing a
critical fact that the human species is
now facing a question that has never
before arisen in human history question
that has to be answered quickly will
human society survive for long well as
you all know for seventy years we've
been living under the shadow of nuclear
war those who've looked at the record
can only be amazed that we've survived
this far a time after time has come
extremely close to terminal disaster
even minutes away
kind of a miracle that we survived
miracles don't go on forever this has to
be terminated and quickly the recent
Nuclear Posture review of the new Trump
administration dramatically increases
the threat of conflagration which would
in fact be terminal for the species we
may remember that this Nuclear Posture
review was sponsored by Jim mattis who
was regarded as too civilized to make
everything to be retained and the
administration gives you a sense of what
can be tolerated in the Trump Pompeo
open world well there were three major
arms treaties of the ABM Treaty that a
ballistic missile treaty the INF treaty
intermediate nuclear forces the New
START treaty the u.s. pulled out of the
ABM Treaty in 2002 and anyone who
believes that anti-ballistic missiles or
defensive weapons is deluded about the
nature of these systems the u.s. has
just pulled out of the INF treaty
established by Gorbachev and Reagan in
1987 which sharply reduced the threat of
war in Europe which would very quickly
spread the background of that signing of
that treaty was the demonstrations that
you just saw depicted on the film
massive public demonstrations were the
background for leading to a treaty that
made a very significant difference it's
worth remembering that many other cases
were significant popular activism has
made a huge difference the lessons are
too obvious to enumerate well the Trump
administration is just withdrawn from
the INF treaty the Russians withdrew
right afterward
if you take a close look you find that
each side has a kind of incredible case
saying that the opponent has not lived
up to the treaty for those who want a
picture of the how the Russians might
look at it The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists the major journals on arms
control issues had a lead article a
couple of weeks ago by Theodore postal
pointing out how dangerous the US
installations of anti-ballistic missiles
on the Russian border how dangerous they
are and can be perceived to be by the
Russians notice on the Russian border
attentions are mounting on the Russian
border both sides are carrying out
provocative actions we should in a
rational world what would happen would
be negotiations between the two sides
with independent experts to evaluate the
charges that each is making against the
other to lead to a resolution of these
charges restore the treaty that's a
rational world but it's unfortunately
not the world we're living in and though
efforts are all have been made in this
direction and they won't be unless there
is significant pressure well that leaves
the New START treaty the New START
treaty has already been designated by
the figure in charge who has modestly
described himself as the greatest
president in American history he gave it
the usual designation of anything that
was done by his predecessors the worst
treaty that ever happened in human
history we've got to get rid of it if in
fact this comes up for renewal right
after the next election
and a lot as a state law is at stake and
whether that treaty will be renewed it
has succeeded and very significantly
reducing the number of nuclear weapons
to a level way above what they ought to
be but way below what they were before
and it could go on well meanwhile global
warming proceeds on its inexorable
course during this millennium every
single year with one exception has been
hotter than the last one the there are
recent scientific papers James Hansen
and others which indicate that the pace
of global warming which has been
increasing since about 1980 may be
sharply escalating and may be moving
from linear growth to exponential growth
which means doubling every couple of
decades
we're already approaching the conditions
of 125,000 years ago when this the sea
level was about roughly 25 feet higher
than it is today with the melting the
rapid melting of the Antarctic huge ice
fields we might that point might be
reached the consequences that are almost
unimaginable I mean I won't even try to
depict them that you can figure out
quickly what that means well meanwhile
while this is going on you regularly
read in the press euphoric accounts of
how the United States is advancing and
fossil fuel production snow surpass
Saudi Arabia were in the lead of fossil
fuel production the big banks JP Morgan
Chase and others are
pouring money into new investments in
fossil fuels including the most
dangerous like Canadian tar sands and
this is all presented with great
euphoria excitement we're now reaching
energy independence we could control the
world
Thurman the use of fossil fuels in the
world barely a word on what the meaning
of this is which is quite obvious it's
not that the reporters commentators
don't know about it that the CEO of the
banks don't know about it of course they
do but these are kind of institutional
pressures that just are extremely hard
to extricate themselves from you can put
yourself and they try to put yourself in
the position of the say the CEO of
JPMorgan Chase the biggest chip Bank
which is spending large sums and
investment in fossil fuels he certainly
knows everything that you all know about
global warming
it's no secret but what are the choices
basically has two choices the one choice
is to do exactly what he's doing the
other choice is to resign and be
replaced by somebody else will do
exactly what he's doing
it's not an individual problem it's an
institutional problem which can be met
but only under tremendous public
pressure and the secondi we've recently
seen very dramatically how it can tell
the so the solution can be reached a
group of young people sunrise movement
organised got to the point of sitting in
congressional offices aroused some
interest on from the new progressive
the figures who were able to make it to
Congress under a lot of popular pressure
Alexandria or Cassio Cortes joined by Ed
Markey actually placed the green new
deal on the agenda that's a remarkable
achievement of course it's hostile
attacks from everywhere doesn't matter
it's a couple of years ago it was
unimaginable that it would be discussed
as the result of the activism of these
group of young people it's no right in
the center of the agenda
it's got to be implemented in one form
or another it's essential for survival
maybe not exactly that form but some
modification of it tremendous change
achieved by the commitment of a small
group of young people that tells you the
kind of thing that can be done
[Applause]
meanwhile the Doomsday Clock of The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists last
January was set at two minutes to
midnight that's the closest it's been
two terminal disasters since 1947 the
announcement of the settlement of the
setting mentioned the two major familiar
threats the threat of nuclear war his
increasing threat of global warming
which is increasing further and it added
a third for the first time the
undermining of democracy that's the
third threat along with global warming
and nuclear war and that was quite
appropriate because functioning
democracy offers the only hope of
overcoming these threats that are not
going to be dealt with by major
institutions state or private acting
without massive public pressure which
means that the the means of democratic
functioning have to be kept alive used
the way the sunshine movement did it the
way the great mass demonstration in the
early 80s did it and the way we continue
today
