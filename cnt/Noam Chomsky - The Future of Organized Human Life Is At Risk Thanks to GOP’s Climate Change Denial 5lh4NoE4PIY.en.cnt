a couple of weeks ago the IPCC the
international group of scientists
monitoring climate change came out with
a very of ominous report warning that
the world has maybe a decade or two to
basically end its reliance on fossil
fuels if we're to have any hope of
controlling a global warming below the
level of utter disaster and that
incidentally is a conservative estimate
it's a consensus view there are
repeatedly over the years it has been
shown that the IPCC analyses are much
less alarmist than they should be now
comes this report in nature that you
mentioned a couple of days ago which
shows that there has been a serious
underestimate of the of the warming of
the oceans and they conclude that if
these results hold up the so-called
carbon budget the amount of carbon that
we can spew into the atmosphere and
still have a survivable environment has
to be reduced by about 25 percent that's
over and above the IPCC report and the
opening up of the Amazon to further
exploitation will be another serious
blow at the prospects of survival of
organized human society I should at the
same time the Trump administration right
now is opening up new areas of the West
for fracking for increasing the use of
fossil fuels the you've probably seen
maybe discussed the one of the most
amazing dock
I have ever seen the Trump Department of
highway standards whatever it's called
just issued a long report hundred page
report urging that all regulations on
automotive emissions should be ended and
they had a very logical argument they
said if we extrapolate current trends by
the end of the century of the climate
will have warmed several degrees
centigrade meaning a huge rise in sea
level which they underestimate so
basically we're going over the cliff
anyway and automotive emissions don't
really add much to this so there's no
point cutting them back the assumption
of the the department is that everyone
in the world is as criminally insane as
we are and isn't going to do anything
about it and since on that assumption
yeah let's let's just Rob while the
planet firms putting a euro into the
shade he only fiddled while Rome burned
burned I can't think of anything like
this in human history you just can't
find words to describe it and it's I
mean at the peak of the monstrosity is
in fact the Trump administration we
should recall that Trump himself as I
mentioned is a firm believer in global
warming
recently he applied to the government of
Ireland for permission to build a huge
wall one of his famous walls this one to
protect a golf course of his in Ireland
which as his plea indicates is
threatened by sea-level rise as a result
of global warming you take a look at the
big banks JPMorgan Chase and the others
the
increasing their investments in fossil
fuel development the energy corporations
are working all over the world to try to
find new resources to destroy the
environment the media are focusing on a
real outrageous like the ludicrous
military preparation for this wave of
mothers and children planning to invade
us and destroy us you know they're
concentrating on that but take a look at
their coverage of these things and so
there was a big report long front-page
report in The New York Times a couple
days ago about the opening up of the
West to further fossil fuel extraction
discuss everything you can think of
didn't mention some of the negative
consequences like it might harm water
resources it might make things so Harmar
harder for Ranchers not one phrase one
phrase in this long report on the effect
on the environment in the political clam
pain at going on every all kinds of
issues are not discussed but not the two
existential threats that the human
beings face threats that have never
arisen in human history we have to make
decisions now which will literally
determine whether organized human life
can survive in any decent form you can
just imagine what the world would be
like if the sea level rises say 10 or 20
feet or even higher this is within the
range of easily within the range of
predictions I mean the consequences are
unimaginable but it's as if we're a kind
of like the proverbial lemmings just
happily marching off the cliff led by
leaders who understand very well what
they're doing
are so dedicated to enriching themselves
and their friends in the near future
that it simply doesn't matter what
happens to the human species there's
nothing like this in all of human
history
they've been plenty of monsters in the
past plenty of but you can't find one
who was dedicated with passion to
destroying the prospects for organized
human life
Hitler was horrible enough but not that
the world-renowned professor linguist
and dissident Noam Chomsky when we
returned with him in a moment he'll talk
about the Pittsburgh synagogue attack
the crisis in Gaza and the us-backed
Saudi war in Yemen stay with us
