Industrial Revolution was beginning and
working people were beginning to
struggle against the growing business
system later the corporate system and
you see it in the labor press of the
kind that I mentioned there were people
bitterly combating what they called the
new spirit of the age gained wealth
forgetting all but self that's not the
way we live we live cooperatively we
help each other we have a high cultural
level which in fact they did and it's
all being destroyed we're being degraded
that had not turned into the night so
that's one of those streams that led to
the Knights of Labor which was quite a
massive organization under thousands of
people it was destroyed that they tried
to link up into a farmer labor alliance
became the populist movement among the
agrarian population the quaint lively
labor movement and I mean it some in the
late in the 1890s I mean in the mining
and steel areas like western
Pennsylvania they were running the towns
they had the mayors and so you know it
was pretty much crushed by force right
through this period Knights of Labor
were crushed and by Jay Gould you know
in the gang you know the security forces
smashed up the strikes they were never
able to figure out a way of preventing
scabs strike breakers and that they were
used along with National Guard and the
private security forces just to smash up
strikes so people don't call the
the Knights of Labor or the farmers
Alliance anarchism these were huge
popular movements which had kind of
anarchists strange to them they never
heard of anarchism if you look at
factory workers right around here in New
England where the Industrial Revolution
began in the 1840s 1850s I mean they
were despont they had a laborer pressed
which was very lively labor press in
which working people were participating
and artisans young women from the farms
and so on and a lot of it was anarchist
themes they never heard of anarchism the
you know workers those who owned who
work in the mills you know them we don't
want to who were being degraded by the
force of capitalist oppression we should
be free we should have our free rights
as humans they're taking away our
culture and so on a very similar to the
themes you get in the anarchist writings
there was also a parallel the farmers
movement remember it was mostly an
agricultural society but there was a
huge spontaneous farmers movement
actually rooted in Texas it's hard to
believe when you come back but none
quite radical radical populist movement
the farmers were being wiped out by
merchants banks and they were trying to
find ways out of it and as they tried to
work their way out of it they began to
form cooperatives first marketing
cooperatives later production
cooperatives finally even financial
independent financial institutions to
free them from they didn't call it Wall
Street then from the New England you
know the
the Boston bankers and so on the New
England bankers who were strangling them
and this they tried to you know and they
had just plain mostly people without any
formal education you know just somebody
had been to school for two years as what
they called lectures going around but
most of the country organizing people
and so on
