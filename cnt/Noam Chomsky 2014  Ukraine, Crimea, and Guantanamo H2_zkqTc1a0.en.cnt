well take crimeans interesting case the
Russian takeover of Crimea is
undoubtedly a criminal act it violates
the UN charter or it violates specific
treaties in which Russia agreed with
others to observe the boundaries of
Ukraine so it's a criminal act is it the
only such act in the world for example
how much have you read about a much more
severe case the u.s. takeover of
southeastern Cubitt 110 years ago us
took over southeastern Cuba at the point
of a gun effect technically that was a
treaty but under military occupation you
know what that means it was a treaty in
which it's what we call Guantanamo that
includes Cuba's major port US has
absolutely no claim to it whatever one
thinks about Crimea there is a claim
popular support the history of course
Jeff's handing over of crimea to ukraine
without even asking the population a
referendum in 1991 which came out with
about the same results as the recent one
the major Russian warm water port naval
base of there's considerations in the
case of the u.s. take over south eastern
Cuba there is nothing since Cuban
independence in 1959 the Cuban
government's been trying to get it back
us of course refuses the only
justification is that this severely
hampers the economic development of Cuba
for 50 years the United States has been
engaged in a significant war against
Cuba under Kennedy it was a large-scale
terrorist campaign we don't talk about
it here it was a very serious terrorist
campaign which continued crushing
embargo taking over the southeastern
cube of course severely hampers Cuban
development that's the point this is
much worse than
the Russians though their actions are
criminal have a much stronger case how
much have you read in the press about
this and it's not the only case
