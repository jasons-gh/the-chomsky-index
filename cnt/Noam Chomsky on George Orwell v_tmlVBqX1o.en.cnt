Orwell is famous for his searching and
sardonic critique of the way thought is
controlled by force under authoritarian
dystopia but much less is not known is
his discussion of how similar outcomes
are achieved in free societies he's
speaking of course of England and he
wrote that although the country is quite
free nevertheless unpopular ideas can be
suppressed without the use of course
gave a couple of examples provided a few
words of explanation which were to the
point the one particularly pertinent
comment was his observation on a quality
education in the best schools where it
is instilled into you that there are
certain things that it simply wouldn't
do to say or we may add even to think
one reason why not much attention is
paid to this essay is that it wasn't
published it was found decades later in
his unpublished papers it was intended
as the introduction to his famous animal
farm bitter satire of Stalinist
totalitarianism why it wasn't published
it's apparently unknown but I think
perhaps you can speculate
[Music]
Blizzard's semi-trucks gated Michigan
absolutely so so he understand the
enemy's goal I'm gonna gave a very
minute
so they're saying
[Music]
he's going comrades is no hierarchy
participating things out of life but
something you just haven't appreciated
came back a couple months later and he
said oh there
and I'm scraping the orders Stalinist
kind of leisure
they never crush the revolution is in
the process of Russian Revolution
this perspective just as a person
I didn't think that 1984 was one of our
wills right just with the tape truth get
barely finishing I thought it was kind
of obvious and wouldn't you know you
know we really you know he had some nice
comments about new speak and this rat
that was good useful phrases but I
didn't think was much of a book so what
does it mean to be a liberal or a
communist or anything else that maybe
went to door well made I mean being one
way of trying to undermine independent
thoughts and creative purchased of the
world is to simply destroy the way of
talking about things so the words
literally almost have no meaning in fact
by now just about every word has that's
used in political discourse has at least
two means a literal meaning and its
opposite and it's the opposite it's
normally used so they take a
contemporary debate that's going on
right now
you see headlines in newspapers about a
report on foreign fighters in Iraq
Condoleezza Rice announces that she's
got a that this needs asked a question
about how can we sell problem in Iraq
that's quite easy just keep the foreign
fighters out keep the foreign weapons
out and it'll all be settled and nobody
bats an eye those are their 150,000 US
troops there I mean are they bringing in
weapons they're not foreign because
anything we do is not foreign if we
invaded Canada they would be enemy
confidence and we would be there by
right so the concept of concepts like
aggression invasion terror anything you
mentioned this doesn't exist I'm gonna
take take democracy a George Bush was in
Egypt yesterday
praising President Mubarak the Egyptians
are
at the same time he's giving talks about
how we have to promote democracy and so
on
I mean they just come from Saudi Arabia
the most extreme one of the most extreme
fundamentalist charities in the world
you know see a picture of him with King
Abdullah watching a horse show and so on
and so forth
I mean well what are we to make of all
of this the terms for discussing things
have been almost evacuated at the
content who made a distinction between
what he called people and unpeople
people are those who count on people are
those who are the not human you do
anything to whom you like actually that
came up to me vividly a couple of hours
ago I happen to be in a video conference
in London and the the moderator of the
group there of them the questions he
asked he pointed he'd this he brought up
the horror in the west over the
beheadings that are taking place the
headings of journalists there was
another one Algeria there two ago and he
said this is creating such extraordinary
outrage in the West that we just have to
do something about it and he said that
is this was pretty liberal group said
that we recognize that the u.s. British
Israeli atrocities are pretty awful but
even during the Israeli attack on Gaza I
mean you didn't see things like
beheadings didn't you in fact during the
Israeli attack on Gaza if you look at
the sectors of Gaza that were subjected
really vicious murderous attack like
Sofia after the attack kind of relented
that people went in and were picking up
pieces of bodies to try to identify who
was murdered but all of that was
reported but he was correct that didn't
horrify the West when we carry out
atrocities like smashing people up so
that their body parts are scattered
around then you can't even identify who
they were that's not a crime it can be a
mistake you're sometimes allowed to say
it some
take that just like the drone
assassination campaign which undoubtedly
does worse things and be heading to this
victims it's a mistake maybe it's a
mistake but it's not a crime on the
other hand if Isis or whatever offshoot
it isn't Algeria beheads people that
offends us and to the heavens and it is
horrendous undoubtedly though it's a
tiny fraction of what we and our clients
do but that's the people on people
distinction almost infinitesimal of
people who fulfill the responsibilities
of intellectuals they use their their
credibility they use their their their
access they use their tools etc etc to
try and discuss reality in a way that
actually is consistent with human
well-being and consistency and so on
then we have virtually everybody who has
those attributes who has those
advantages who is capable of
understanding when it serves their
interests so they'll they'll search far
and wide for something about somebody
who they wish to prosecute but is
completely incapable as you describe it
even incapable of hearing the words when
it's contrary to this background of
interest ok now it might not matter
because the fact is the crucial thing
but lots and lots of people hear that
and the and the way that they dismiss it
is to say it can't be because what would
explain it why would all those people
behave in such a way how could they
possibly have the mental capacity to see
the truth and not see the truth not you
know it must be the small number of
people who are confused not the large
number of people how do you answer that
actually we'll had a word for it ago
that doublethink better think is the
capacity to hold two contradictory ideas
in mind and believe in both that's
practically a defining characteristic of
intellectual history secondly it is not
nothing about the United States
as far as I know this is close to
historically universal I find very few
exceptions and furthermore it goes back
to the earliest recorded history
furthermore every person who asks this
question knows the answer all I have to
do is look at themselves how many people
have failed to go through an experience
like for example when you're you know 6
years old and your little brother takes
a toy and you want the toy and your
mother's not looking and you're bigger
than he is so you grab the toy and then
the kid starts yelling and your mother
comes in and she starts century you for
taking the toy and how do you answer he
said yeah I took the toy because I
wanted it and he's smaller than me where
do you say look he didn't want the toy
anyway besides it was mine and he really
stole it from me so I was right you know
anybody an answer can you know who
anybody who hasn't gone through such
experiences in their life yeah so we all
know the answer to the question hey you
there are ways of easy ways to
rationalize whatever happens in a
usually complicated world so as to
protect yourself furthermore the fact
that intellectuals act like this is
close to tautology you don't become a
respected intellectual unless you do
this kind of thing not you know through
not like Kissinger just civility the
master I look because you internalize it
