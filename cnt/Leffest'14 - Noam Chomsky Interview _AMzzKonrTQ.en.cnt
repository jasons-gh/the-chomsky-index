we talk about
and yes and what you do as well we do
with the people you're close to Snowden
and you know try to do the refraction
about how what is the service is not in
terms of global service a little about
the society you know takes that takes it
you know because I think
father big brother and everybody's
accepting their without America and he's
about all these that I think my 10 you
do something I hope we to do the fire
yesterday other people your age in Italy
respond traditionally so I'm leaving
it's very interesting because in elites
so in the best universities there is
quite less with stones no language who
has quite a Mexican exactly where in
Sweden in general more about people like
us and if there's a lot of controversy
about the action is good if there can be
supported or not able to do a lot of
debates and out but I got tons of
criticism come on they can see there
they're very skeptical about the reasons
they and for example I mean it's not
yeah for example to consider that French
country can justify that rhythm yeah so
in the India but really narrow very
relative at least and the further you go
into society deeper into the country and
the more America without asking because
just small experiment with my own
grandchildren their friends or in their
twenties
we put everything on facebook it's about
that you know what is the discussion now
did you know we can how to be arrived on
that you know what we're arriving this
kind of you know acceptance of the
society of all these cultural that any
of us now know so teenage very much
society is so exhibition there is also
between the facts of many many young
people you know and they treat them as
heroes but it doesn't provoke any kind
of mobilization yeah yeah if you just
tell you the perception and new people
you know surprise what was your deal yes
yeah discourse of people assigned on
what seamless and do they follow with
you
yes about this but it was considered
that as a bit paranoid was I think that
I don't know what you think I maybe but
I think that when Snowden relations were
so important because it reveal that not
it legit my the discourse of those who
were
[Music]
what what is he saying
I mean I saw that you signed a few weeks
ago over - I mean and I feel personally
to supports memory why did you decide
and in you and you see as an American I
part of up a team of American Germany or
a mobile proper ability to some extent
or other some of the interesting Snowden
revelations have dueling in England the
government was requesting the United
States he uses advanced technology to
spy on British uses an antenna system
power is going to want to have total
information about its enemies and the
domestic population is one of the main
enemies this goes way back to a major to
look at us
Albert McCoy's the United States pioneer
that what these things 100 years ago but
after the US Congress Philippines they
killed a couple hundred thousand people
with the pacified and they developed
using the highest technology of the day
they try to gather massive information
right they recognize that if they knew
enough information about them they could
use it to undermine organization to
discredit people incite conflicts among
people wouldn't basically break up the
independent nationalist movements and it
was quite successful it's so successful
but if you take a look at East Asia
today in the southeast and East Asia
there's a kind of famous aided miracle
with one exception which is not
participated
u.s. control for a century and its
remains dependent further so penis have
been so indoctrinated that they tend to
support the US and its crimes beyond
other people even though they are the
main victims that's a real achievement
and it's now over hundred years McCoy
discusses as soon as these methods were
developed for the Philippines they were
immediately transferred back home so
Woodrow Wilson use same techniques and
the Red Scare system power our very
country very different populations and
with good reason
and gaining information and that's an
interesting that's the question that
monkey twice incidentally if you read
the reports last publication about these
forty two Israeli intelligence agents he
saw that he will take a look at what
they're describing the work that they
were doing is exactly what McCoy was
describing in the Philippines 100 years
ago of course they can now cover
everybody not just Italy
so find out what everyone in the
occupied territories is doing and find
out if this person is then you can force
them to become a collaborator discredit
an activist
and how we expect that I'm so the US
market to market and usually 20 years
ago and happy block these things and now
they're adding to that this mass
surveillance mechanisms yeah any
technologies and maybe straightening it
and at the same time you can see someone
like Edward Snowden for example that
comes out around denouncing dangerous
with issues
the question would be cut out and how we
hoping he understood that among I
Snowden could culture these these
massive these two massive food that are
joining together and counter discourse
the public the state is for the nursery
is paying the European countries are so
frightened of the United States of
European cowardice is unbelievable so
frightened that countries like France
wouldn't allow the plane to cross their
airspace for fear that the United States
might be angry after when he was finally
forceful and atmosphere of the Oakland
Police sent replacement this is a
presidential planning principle movie
complaining because they're just
terrified the United States but at the
same time you can see that its course
now there the discourse of snogging the
general that the denunciation of his
method is very pervasive and has and the
counter discourse of the state does it
seem to be to be working and how do you
explain that
[Music]
[Music]
so he was right away is that the
occupation is going to turn Israelis
into what Ecole you do announcers
they're going to become like Nazis
because when you have somebody's neck
you have to find a way to justify it
pretty soon you make up the
justification internalize it just
everything races that's what he
predicted in 1967 and you can see it's a
dynamic sorry perfectly predictable
that's what happens when you are
pressured you don't say I'm a monster
you say I'm doing it for their good and
they're the ones who they're resistant
otherwise you did people like the cold
mountain air she hates the Arabs because
their portion plus wonderful foods to
shoot them by now it's spread across the
society but it's part of the dynamics
with pressure it was the same with
slavery in fact it's just in domination
Cole you cannot accept you very few
people and cheaper moment with any way
way that the origins of society from an
effort this society United States was
based on two fundamental principles one
is extermination of the native
population the other was slavery and
both when I was growing up a child we
would play cowboys and Indians where we
would beat the Cowboys showing the
Indians touch me at the defenders
today earlier pile of documents which
were quite interesting the RAND
Corporation had translated Japanese
counterinsurgency literature from the
nineteen thirties insurgency techniques
were of course the same but what was
interesting about them was and they
described themselves this is a time when
the Japanese were carrying out
horrifying but they were describing
themselves as noble the most noble
people who were trying to bring an
earthly paradise to the Chinese to
defend the Chinese people against the
Chinese Banda's trying to prevent Japan
and they were sacrificing themselves he
was reviewing a history of empire we
will just without you subjugated for me
it's very strange
he's out to know the acceptance by for
example senators and congressmen all
these things they are needed they are
being controlled and
before you know remember what to do
something like definitely like the kind
of trying to load something you know
from in a way that he was not reveal it
was completely you know when president
just fall but now they know exactly have
been control the congressman's and the
senators and they don't reacted hope
they they just abused the wrong people
as they're being controlled by private
property at all and being a total energy
which can't do very much driven in fact
take another water why does water get
considered such a scandal
so Nixon Nixon had an enemies with which
is terrible
there's nothing ever happened but it
wasn't us because either than Amish
people like how can you call and porton
people they broke into had a bunch of
growth there were major crimes here in
water here so right at the time that
water it was exposed very same something
else was exposed Cody tell pro this is a
program by the national political police
the FBI through four administration's
gotten with Eisenhower went through
Kennedy Johnson still going on but under
Nixon it was a program that began by a
super stack on the Communist Party but
it's pretty we were treating
independence movement for the Native
American movement was just using every
technique possible to undermine and
discredit and destroy his men and it was
pretty serious one of the main targets
was quite nationalists and they were
simply Massacre ready one of the worst
cases was was exposed right with water
he was the murder of a black act
organized with Fred Hampton in Chicago
by the police in a typical to stop oh
great
police impacted were worked up in the
morning murder didn't embed it was
probably drug murdered somebody else was
with him this was all set up by the FBI
and the FBI had tried to get some other
black group to tell them
so they set it up with police that's a
good step of stylus estimation if
somebody is organizing at that signal
event the whole story in fact even this
method I mean it was literally at the
level of Allied bombings during that all
the entire Pacific area during World War
two Rodya Nixon's orders transmitted by
his loyal servant and there it isn't
worth anything that flies against
anything that moves
that's a call for genocide but I just
can't find in this article and if they
found anything like that pretty let's
say but from the looks of it everybody
overdo it but you can't come on I found
it for Henry Kissinger Richardson
there's anybody here
I mean Watergate was considered a crime
because important people were mildly
farm very mild and mild harm to
important people ISM means the
foundations you go seek that now they
feel that I'd be Petrovic any say as
well I mean microklen and I said but you
could go get on cash so they pick they
want there's no I mean they were
controlled by the FBI but that's a long
before the NSA I mean Hoover was using
the techniques device in the Philippines
to get information about everyone in
Washington so he would get mad
one of the main things I was doing
trying to get information about people
in the political class so you could
blackmail you could come to the senator
and tell them look if you do so and so
I'm going that's that kind of control
it's been going on for so much
immigration and I said yes just at scale
it's just an extension of em see any
great breaking scales different but the
scale reflects the availability of the
technology it's you know there's if they
would develop techniques to say pick up
your brainwaves what's this new power
below that's why the Philippines story
is going and you really study that's the
first modern the first modern food with
technology today was the Philippines and
it's been fantastically effect but also
as I say after 110 years don't injure
still control if you see that any power
I'm that power Konami I mean he's a
summation and must be control of the
Nazis
he's inherent to power or he seemed
Christian here to power to try
yeah I'm a Mac to obtain your forte
price or I'm because there is a trend in
this resistance movement not to gain
power in order to obtain these results
but in plants mistake so you simply
already trying to do is to diffuse or
nobody as well so you think you can stay
outside the power and still exactly like
that
in none with the transition from safe
Kings to parliamentary democracy is an
important step doesn't eliminate
parliamentary that say the government of
the United States has much less power
than these poor coming through people a
court to go murmuring in total there are
popular composer constraints and they
were maybe not well they work so thick
say to Vietnam or take a look at the
night happened through the nineteen
sixties there was the beginning who was
known as no opposition but finally by
the late sixties position develop at
that point the Johnson administration
and running the economic problems the
problem was they had to fight what was
called the onion butter war they had to
keep the population quiet control there
was so much opposition to the war one
result of that is they could never call
a national mobilization that during the
Second World War where people really
committed to the war there was a
national mobilization so people are
willing to accept which controls
rationale too much acquisition whose all
close was called stagflation
a combination of the stagnation of
inflation the business world in fact by
1968 turned against the war and we're
influential and forcing Johnson
that's the way they how our systems like
look at it they say well we'd end up
harming their interest and the reason
the corner increases because a popular
opposition actually goes beyond the most
interesting part is the very end where
we pending on papers ends in midnight
and 6 we said is we do that domestic
problems we're gonna need those screws
for population control in the United
States tearing the state by the fact
that the population so we have to butter
war we have pacified and that took
resources away from the war claims that
[Music]
[Music]
action of another years ago you were
advocating today you were a Public Enemy
50 years ago there is no game even the
public and me from the inside see the
word you think it would be still another
150 years if it is permanent and but you
think that there can be a society in
which
[Music]
you don't break rings in the question is
I mean because it's it's something that
is under in your in your work which is
the question of the gun into a
resistance to legality or I mean can
easily to commit to go of not just on
the a Snowden as a punter life but now
in order to change a system do we have
to respect the freedom of the Democrats
in the kind of null hypothesis
call applause so if I Drive home tonight
there's a traffic light it's red stop on
the other hand Congress for
authorization for higher law we look
under the US Constitution valid treaties
of a supreme law of the land
the major valid trees UN Charter that
bans the threat or use of force butter
ropes like the United States thank you
very much thank you very for your family
I wanted to ask you about you don't you
told us yesterday about continuity
between the practices of the United
States that started that were tried in
the Philippines in the early 20th
century and what is today mass
surveillance and you also talked about
the fact that this control on population
and more generally
confrontation between state and
population was very rooted in the
foundations of the US with the genocide
of the Native Americans and other events
I wanted to know if you consider that
these mass rebellions is just another
tool in this tool of government I thank
you for your but we use the Foucault
words which doesn't create any
difference only a difference in scale
and no breaking of any kind
well differences in quantity sometimes
become differences in quality my
impression is it's basically a
difference in scale so the practices
that were developed in detail to control
the Philippine population back in the
early 20th century which were aimed
mostly it elites not so much peasant for
anything kind of disregarded them and
we're very successful in breaking up the
nationalist movements and imposing the
u.s. dominated system which so
successful that it remains until today
as I think I imagined the Philippines
are kind of an outlier in East and
Southeast Asia the one area that hasn't
really developed the has not plenty of
struggles a lot of brutality so for
example after the Second World War the
US backed vicious counter insurgency out
to the crush the peasant independent
rebellions but basically the system is
sustained itself and it was applied at
once at home this was the early this is
like 1910 by 1918 1919 few years later
and pretty much the same systems were
applied at home in what is in fact the
most repressive period of American
history the Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare
which was quite vicious and that long
time in fact and then it continues the
FBI used the same techniques to try to
again aimed mainly at the political
elite to try to ensure that senators
congressional representatives others
would not get out of line because they
have a ton of information about them and
they could use it to slander them the
libel them to initiate stories and so on
by the 1960s and 70s it was being
directed against the entire population
that's the COINTELPRO operations
primarily under the democratic
administrations of the 60s and then mix
and when it was finally terminated by
the court but very similar operations
but in this case directed against
the Native American movements the the
new left black nationalist movements the
women's movements that was pretty
serious it lived as far as literal
political assassination forcing suicides
breaking up groups that was a massive
operation it's pretty hard to think of
it I mean outside of saving these
Germany and so on it's hard to think of
a comparable operation in the Western
society and undermount estate and it's
the state it's the national political
police that's what the FBI is under
executive orders trying to break up and
disrupt the popular activism which was
quite a significant force in the sixties
and early seventies that had substantial
success this now takes about the rotor
skill but this is the kind of thing
you'd expect this is enough power to do
the more information they have about
people the better able they are you
think they are to control and monitor
and
if necessary so that's what you can
think power and so there is this idea
that information is power and your
activism is very linked to this idea
that you have to empower people by
providing them accurate information on
the world and different structures of
power do you think that the I mean do
you think that secret is necessary to
form a power using secrecy is valuable
actually the United States is unusually
open society that we have more access to
internal planning records in the United
States than any country that I know it's
by no means perfect but it's substantial
and when you read through these masses
of internal documents secret documents
as I have done in many cases one thing
is quite striking very little has any
meaningful relation to any real security
issue
most of it is defending the state
against the population they don't want
people know what they're doing so it's
secret but there's very little in the
secret record that would be a little bit
of value let's say to the Russians or
the Chinese or the Cubans were
what they were fighting they usually do
it perfectly well just almost happening
on the ground but it does maintain
secrecy from the population and the
tacit assumption is sometimes overheard
that people shouldn't know these things
there is after all it's worth
remembering a a leading theme of liberal
progressive democratic theory which says
that people should not know that you
find that expressed overtly often in
some of the leading figures so the
leading public intellectuals of 20th
century in the United States walter
Lippmann who was a very distinguished
figure named as a progressive Wilson
roosevelt kennedy style progressive
leading commentator on public affairs he
was also the author of what are called
essays in democratic and progressive
democratic theory and when you read them
what he says is quote he says the public
are ignorant and meddlesome outsiders
they have to be put in their place
decisions have to be made
by the responsible man people like us
people who write this were always among
the responsible men the we and we the
responsible men have to be protected
from the trampling and the roar of the
bewildered bird the ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders and the the job of
what he called manufacturing consent I
borrowed his term for a book that's his
the job of manufacturing consent is to
ensure that the public is marginalized
put in their place for as they can be
spectators but not participants they do
have a role in a political system every
couple of years they're allowed to lend
their weight to one or another of the
responsible men and then they should go
home
keep quiet that's it and this is quite
calm I made the founder of modern modern
political science Harold Lasswell one of
the leading figures also a kind of a
progressive you know by the u.s. stands
a leftist progressive he said we should
not be misled by democratic dogmatism
about people being the best judges of
their own interests they're not they're
too stupid
or it would be unfair to allow them to
make decisions kind of like letting had
a three-year-old ride to the street no
they're not capable so for their own
benefit we should control and control
them about what they do keep them to the
status of observer spectators of what
happens in the political arena and this
is pretty much the way things work so if
you look at you know academic political
science in the United States one of the
major topics that it studies and studies
very well is the relation between public
attitudes and public policy it's
straightforward inquiry public policy
you see public attitudes are available
from extensive polling polling isn't
perfect but it's pretty good and pretty
reliable and often polls have been quite
extensively and there's a massive
information about public attitudes and
public policy and there are results in
the major kind of gold standard works of
political science basic result is that
about 70 percent of the population
lower seventy percent on the incomes
skill is literally disenfranchised their
attitudes have absolutely no effect on
policy their representatives pay no
attention to thoroughly so whatever they
think is disregarded as you move up the
scale you start getting a little more
influence that is more relation between
attitudes and policy and when you get to
the very top which is a fraction of 1%
they're basically making policy so they
get what they want you know this little
fuzziness around the edges but that's
the basic picture
just recently it was a study by released
by Princeton University which got a
little publicity two leading political
scientists who've worked on these things
for years investigated I think about
1,700 major public policy decisions to
investigate who had influence same
result basically the public was
irrelevant almost all and when you get
to the business world extreme wealth so
many have enormous influence actually
creation of policy because they usually
staff the executive either they or their
representatives somebody like say Henry
Kissinger representative
the corporate system but state corporate
system but this is the way it works and
that's considered appropriate in
progressive democratic theory for the
for the for the good of the population
wall which is out of benevolent you
cannot let these ignorant and meddlesome
outsiders that make bad decisions be
terrible when you look at the secrecy
system that's what a lot of it as well
I'd say the overwhelming majority
keeping the ignorant and meddlesome
outsiders in the dark it's not their
business because you think that for
example what happened with Snowden that
these documents you think that the fact
that is if this information which is the
masses which is not sure or so we don't
know if they're really aware of the full
extent of the political implications
you think it could empower them or do
you think they're any way imaginable by
the system and it would be maybe the
upper classes that could that need also
this information well I succeed
passionate attack you know soon as this
started as high-level claims that were
gonna hunt him to the end of the world
and we'll catch him wherever he is well
I mean shows that they're really afraid
now it could be that the fierce paranoia
so for example if at the highest levels
they you know the White House and so on
if they had simply disregarded him it
might have just disappeared possible so
their own paranoia may be feeding the
just demise and since but it does
reflect the attitudes how much effect it
can have well we're not sure the so for
example the word affects Brazil for
example withdrew the presidential visit
didn't quite break relations but
certainly arm and remember a lot of
these Snowden revelations are not just
about surveillance of people there are
also about support for corporate efforts
to undermine business in other countries
so spying on you know the negotiators
and energy deals to make sure that
American corporations have a help on
that and so on
you know big corporations in other
countries don't like that just like
America doesn't like the fact that
somebody's reading their email no but
powerful people and powerful
institutions are being harmed
sufficiently so the was a reaction that
Congress did start to get concerned when
it turned out that the the Senate
committee is responsible for this would
being spied on should say this is
actually nothing new about this so for
example II go back to the foundation of
the United Nations was there was a
conference in San Francisco
1947 which established the United
Nations well it turned out pretty soon
but did they discover that the FBI had
been bugging of the offices of the
foreign delegations I said that American
negotiators could have a step up I'm
trying to get what they wanted didn't
it's a huge fuss made when the Russians
did this to the American Embassy but
it's done all the time at these
geopolitical scale I had the question
are coming back to what you said about
Philippine and the fact that what the
strategy put in place by the US has
still affects more than a hundred years
later oh how can we explain that Latin
America has been one of the strongest
has had one of the strongest reactions
to all these mass surveillance well we
know that the US has evolved its
possibilities which is a very it's a
very significant phenomenon really
historic significant for 500 years
the Latin America had been pretty much
in the hands of foreign powers and elite
mostly white elites tiny aid leads
inside Latin America who accumulated
enormous wealth huge horrendous poverty
and basically rich society and always
under under the hands of the Imperial
for a long time was England last century
or so it's the United States Latin
America was so taken for granted in u.s.
planning that they really hardly even
have plans for so there were some so for
example in 1945 when the US was
beginning the organization of the world
the end of the Second World War the US
didn't call a hemispheric conference in
Mexico and the Latin American states
came and the United States imposed at
that point the US could actually impose
would have wanted imposed what was
called an economic Charter for the
Americas which banned economic
nationalism in all its forms the
latin-american countries had to follow
to be completely open societies which of
course in fact meant open the u.s.
penetration and control wasn't
reciprocal and incidentally the u.s.
itself did not accept these principles
on the contrary it had a high level of
economic nationalism that's why you have
your computer using the internet and so
on
largely state sector actions and this
was they were concerned at the time with
what the State Department called the new
nationalism in Latin
which is driven by the idea that the
people of the country ought to be the
beneficiaries of their resources now we
have to smash this down
no nationalism that's foreign investors
who were the beneficiaries not the
people of the country
it was pretty explicit and at that point
you could just legislated and they do a
bigger pole and so it continued and not
without violence so for example in the
post Stalin period violence and
repression in the American us
dependencies in Latin America was much
worse than they said you were much worse
see an indication of it up there
depiction of the murder of Archbishop
and El Salvador mmm ten years later the
murder of six leading Latin American
intellectuals by forces pretty much
armed and trained by the United States
then East Europe was bad enough things
like that didn't happen now they were
vicious neo-nazi dictatorships and stole
the massive tortures and so on that was
Latin America until about ten or fifteen
years ago and since then there's been a
terrible turn partly it was the effect
of the neoliberal policies of the 1980s
and 90s the Latin America followed the
rules and it was smashed the rules are
very destructive
the countries that didn't follow the
rules like South Korea and Taiwan and so
on they did fine but the Latin American
observed them and it was a very harsh
couple of decades and it was a reaction
there was also finally a reaction to the
us-backed or sometimes us imposed
dictatorships and for a variety of
reasons in the last decade you know 20
years maybe the Latin America has for
the first time in its history and moved
towards first of all integration some
degree of integration of the countries
they were very separated from one
another and the degree of independent
and it's pretty remarkable what you
describe here and the NSA is one example
but there are many others and one of the
most striking examples had to do with
the CIA torture programs the worst
torture programs by far were what was
called the extraordinary rendition
that's a program where you take somebody
you just yeah you're interested in you
suspect him where do you think he has
information you send them to your
favorite dictatorship Assad in Syria
Mubarak I need you to cut off
Olivia and make sure these tortured
sufficiently so that he comes out with
something and then you know maybe you
had some information maybe not there was
a study recently about a year ago of the
countries that participated in
extraordinary renditions most of Europe
England Sweden
all participated probably Italy I don't
remember the Middle East of course
because that's really sent them to me
tortured and most of the rest of the
world
one exception no participation from
Latin America which is doubly
significant first of all because Latin
America used to be the backyard
it would their toll secondly because
during the period of us control Latin
America was one of the world's centres
of torture now they refused to
participate in us were tortured are you
significant you can call them yeah even
Colombians
you take a look at the there are no
hemispheric hemispheric conferences used
to be dia the u.s. gave the orders and
everybody follow them the latest ones
the US and Canada are isolated its Latin
America against
US and Canada and there's already
organizations formed said that which
excluded North American just Latin
American Caribbean countries that's a
remarkable change and the US have simply
lost control of the region and it's
interesting for European because of the
contrary it may be a perception that we
see Europe down every time gave him
getting more you're becoming a lot of
American on it's very it was pretty
dramatic was the cases of the immoral is
playing this is Bolivia worst country in
the hemisphere outside of Haiti under
the indigenous majority the president
went to Russia talk so flew back the
European countries are so terrified of
the United States that they wouldn't let
him cross their airspace of their
cowering in terror of the Europeans
because the master might be angry at
them meanwhile a Latin America the
poorest country in South America is
defying the United States it's very
troubling muscle it should tell the
European something you know without the
cameras that's and yet especially since
we come from I mean there were the pure
and during the because you can
understand them in the Cold War that
there could be a better like a legit
amazing I mean could utilize the bring
friends of the US but it's for example
in France it specially since the end of
the Cold War that there's been this
alignment like the enter NATO without
and it's difficult to understand what
happened doctor
was the mr. zanuck first of all during
the Cold War remember that part of the
reason for NATO significant part was to
keep you were under control the as long
as nato europe dependent on the united
states and efforts to move in an
independent direction which did exist
the goal really brought stability others
were very much feared in the united
states there was fear of was called the
third force Russia or the United States
and Europe would become a third
independent force which it could have
Europe's population speaker in the
United States and advanced industrial
societies in many ways more advanced
than the United States if they if your
wanted to it could become independent
force in the US didn't want it and
that's I think a large part of the
reason why NATO remains man is even
expanded so there's no Russian threat
when they talk it's
quickly - just keep your under control
so yes there was no pressure - you could
imagine the effectiveness of propaganda
about legitimizing US influence but if
you look into it it's pretty shaky but
what's happened since I might say take
France as France is quite interesting
until the 1970s the French intellectuals
were the last Stalinists in the world
fanatic Stalinists and Maoist I mean
nobody in the world in the West
believes that is but they were still
mouthing all the slogans I remember
talks and friends could believe what I
was hearing
talking to the leading French
intellectuals about the genius - over in
the mid seventies this radically change
as far as I can tell it changed that the
events that changed it was probably the
soldier Nixon's gulag that was
translated into French everybody read it
and since the French intellectuals have
to be in the lead in the world because
after all it's France they suddenly
presented themselves as the first people
in the world who understood the evils of
Stalinism and these great intellectuals
were writing articles with great you
know self brady's about things that I
knew when I was 10 years old because
everybody
but I mean they were obviously factors
behind but there was a shift among the
intellectual classes from a weird form
of Stalinism third-world ISM
not everyone of course no substantial
part to becoming the most reactionary
sector of the Western intellectuals and
of course praising themselves for their
magnificence and discovering what
everybody always knew you know in fact
it's kind of comical when you look at
the productions and it continues like
that it's a very strange this is kind of
a strain of hysteria and the culture
which is interesting to investigate I
think a lot of the that postmodern
sometimes say excesses grow out of that
but and you had similar things happening
in the other countries what the reasons
are well interesting to investigate but
the tendencies record I wanted to asked
about coming back to this question of
and we talked yesterday also by the way
I'm can read this is legally who do we
have with this legally or and there is a
question for your secret services
displayed by nature to the public
scrutiny and in a way is it possible to
control them like through Democratic
means I mean there is observers yes
there is like a contradiction between
the amok recei and the truth they
control the not just the secret services
but things like say Claudia
which is still largely secret mm-hmm
some bits and pieces of they've come out
it did appear to be involved in the
neo-fascist terror in Italy seventies
and so on probably other things that
there's not much research on yellow
cancer and Switzerland one of the few
researchers but that doesn't should be
publicly exposed and under public
control and the same with the secret
services in the United States after the
NSA exposures there were some measures
passed in Congress to limit or restrict
the right of the executive to say spy on
Americans but very limited but that's a
really a question of public pressure
this is enough it can be eliminated but
you still to leave that in a broader way
and because we have learned even in the
era in which the state is a universal
form you did you ever question the fact
that we needed a state as a state
altogether yes
or at the national or just at the
national level I think all my life
that's why since childhood have been
very much attracted by anarchist ideas I
the night the nation stage is not some
kind of universal property it's a
special construction mainly in Europe
spread over the world with European
imperialism and settlement and it's in
many ways a very destructive system so
take take the Middle East which is
falling for raging chaos but largely
this is a long term effect of the
imposition of a nation-state system by
the European imperial power is mostly
England in France for their own interest
not for the interest of the people so it
takes that Iraq the Iraq was hatched
together by the British in after the
Second World War first world war when
they were kind of parceling out the
former Ottoman Empire it was put
together in such a way as to the
boundaries were drawn by Britain to
ensure that England not Turkey would
have control of the oil fields
near the Turkish border and Kuwait was
established as a british-run
principality primarily in order to
blogger Iraq's free access to the sea
this is mechanism control and that put
together Shiites and Sunnis Kurds
is to admit who weren't particularly
hostile but basically nothing not much
to do with each other it's done for
Imperial interest the same was true the
French took Syria Lebanon did the same
thing the British took Palestine for
geostrategic
reasons primarily it was like a cover of
the Bible said this and that and the
whole reason in turmoil and if you live
around takes a look at Africa as
violence everywhere almost all of it
when you look at it has to do with the
nation-state systems that were imposed
by the European powers for their own
interest that drawing lines that broke
tribes in half let's say putting people
together over text say Pakistan in
Afghanistan the British during the days
when they ruled India drew a line the
Durand Line for their interests that was
gonna be British India separate from the
rest the Durand Line happens it now
separates Pakistan from Afghanistan it
cuts right through the question of
territories right through some of them
are in Pakistan so we're not gonna stir
that when a tribesman and
say it goes from Pakistan into
Afghanistan to
you know visit relatives we can call it
a terrorist attack and send drones to
kill them but from their point of view
it's that's their country imperial
powers broken have effect the same is
true of the US and Mexico the u.s.
conquer about half of Mexico in a verbal
war of aggression mid 19th century the
border was pretty artificial saying
people lived on both sides it was a very
permeable border all kinds of
developments but it wasn't until pretty
recently laid in 1990s that the water
started to get militarized
and the militarization of the border in
fact took a big step forward when NAFTA
was enacted 1994 when I ran through the
NAFTA over public opposition he also
started militarizing the border because
the planners could easily understand
that Nast is going to create a huge
number of refugees in Mexico the Mexican
compass in us can be quite efficient but
they can't compete with the highly
subsidized US agribusiness and seems to
more generally
clover if you choose yes to militarize
the border no if you people crossing the
border
shoot them center back and so on and
this is all over the world so there's
nothing natural about the nation state
system I mean you can see how unnatural
it is by looking at European history the
centuries during which this system was
imposed were the most some of the most
savage centuries in human history of the
30 Years War and maybe a third of the
population of Germany was slaughtered
this is all part of imposing nation
state systems finally in 1945 the
Europeans did recognize but the next
time they play their favorite game of
slaughtering each other it's gonna be
the end so Europe did finally move
towards some kind of integration which
began to somewhat erode the the
nation-state the borders which are
generally pretty artificial and I think
that's a positive direction should take
place elsewhere in the world but at the
same time it creates even more important
distance between the people of course
because you're your thing your thoughts
are always about this relationship of
power between power established our and
society and for example we continue of
how the distancing between both between
both has created even more difficulties
to grasp politics further or further
I think there's other developments for
taking place like one of the things
that's happening in the more integrated
Europe is a very sharp attack on popular
democracy decisions are being made in
Brussels by the bureaucrats and the
Bundys Punk and are imposed on the
countries when Monti was elected in
Italy population had almost nothing to
do with came from Brussels that when the
Greek Prime Minister Papandreou had the
effrontery to suggest that there you
might ask the population do they want
the palace policies that was fury all
over Europe Dairy US population this is
decided by the responsible men Brussels
you know and I mean even the Wall Street
Journal had an article pointing out that
no matter what political party took
power and your right to left
they always followed the same policies
because their company not coming from
the country so that's another tendency
other things don't happen just
mechanically a lot of things going on
thank you very much
