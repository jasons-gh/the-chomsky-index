well I was asked to can you hear me with
no how's that better okay I was asked to
talk about what drives us foreign policy
sorry how's that better okay and what
drives us foreign policy and what we can
do to change it a good way to start an
inquiry into what drives foreign policy
is to start with what doesn't drive it
and that's pretty easy to determine
there's a simple method just took take a
look at the conventional theses as to
the roots of foreign policy and ignore
them because they you can quickly see
that they don't work so the major thesis
constantly is that the foreign policy is
driven by noble intent so humanitarian
intervention and bringing democracy and
so on that acclaim as far as i know is
close to universal almost every foreign
policy initiative by any state expresses
noble intent and it's very familiar in
our own history back to the very
beginning so you might say that US
foreign policy begin is when the
pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts and
they came with the most
of objectives you can see them on the
internet if you look up the Great Seal
of the bay colony of Massachusetts 380
years ago it depicts an Indian with his
Spears pointed down signed piece and a
scroll coming out of his mouth saying
come over and help us so the pilgrims
who were coming were noble humanitarians
who were responding to the plea of the
queer pagans to come and Christianize
them and help them and incidentally
exterminate them but that's one of those
things collateral damage that's called
these days and as I say that is
universal so if you read say Hitler's
speeches when he was taking over Drexel
a key or invading Poland full of the the
most humane uplifting rhetoric or
Japanese fascists when they were
rampaging in China and in the hope with
the intention of creating an earthly
paradise for the people they were
massacring and protect them from the
Chinese bandits were who were inflicting
damage on them and that you might search
and sieving find an exception to that
it's pretty rare so what it means is
that the claim of noble intent simply
carries no information literally it's
completely predictable so therefore it
carries no information
the technical sense of the word seeing
disregarded a second thesis is that
chronic policy is driven by what's
called the national interest what's the
national interest so for example is the
say take the CEO of General Electric and
the janitor who cleans the floor of his
office do they have the same interests
well not exactly there are some respects
in which there are some shared interests
for example the interest in security and
it's very commonly argued that security
that search for security is with drives
policy that's pretty easily testable so
take for example of the invasion of Iraq
now that was undertaken with the
expectation that it would increase the
threat of terror in fact it did by about
a factor of seven in the first year is
that undertaken to preserve security and
hardly it was recently an inquiry in
Britain Chilcott inquiry looking into
the roots of the war planning for the
war on the head of their mi5 century the
FBI testified that both British
intelligence and the US intelligence a
new quite well that there was no threat
from Iraq but that invading it would
create a thread which indeed it did
others react pretty much the same way
now there's one exception to this
foreign policy and domestic policy are
driven by a search for security in a
very special sent a security for those
groups in the society that Adam Smith
called the Masters of mankind those who
basically on the society and as he
described are the principal architects
of policy and design it so that their
own interests will be well served no
matter how Grievous the impact on the
domestic population that's a thesis that
holds up pretty well as modern more
sophisticated versions but it's it's
simple and essentially true so take the
example the two thousand eight election
obama won the election because he was
able to outspend McCain is rival and the
main reason he was able to do it was
because there was a flow of funding from
the financial institutions like Corey
the economy these days and they
preferred him to mccain's was aided
poured money into his campaign and he
was able to swing the election well they
expect to be paid off you don't give
money for nothing if you're among the
masters of man's joined and they were
the country was in a deep recession when
Obama came in the first task was to
create a commission to economic mission
to try to find the way out of the
recession if you take a look at who was
on it he was very careful to exclude all
critics of the policies that led to the
recession including Nobel laureates and
picked the people who designed the
policies that created the recession
almost without exception and there was a
result redo Lee version of the result
that was just produced by the Special
Inspector for a government special
inspector for the bailout program Neil
Barofsky he points out that there was a
legislative act that authorized the
bailout and it was a bargain the bargain
was that the financial institutions that
created the crisis
would be saved by the taxpayer and the
victims of their misdeeds would be
somewhat compensated by measures to
protect the home values and preserve
homeownership the core of the recession
was an eight trillion dollar housing
bubble that collapsed leaving people
with no homes and tho kappa well he goes
on to say that only the first part of
the bargain was kept the financial
institutions were rewarded lavishly for
causing the crisis and forgiven for
outright crimes but as he puts it the
rest of the program flounder
foreclosures continue to mount with
eight million 213 million filings
forecast over the program's lifetime
while the biggest banks are twenty
percent larger than they were before the
crisis and control the larger part of
the our economy than ever they
reasonably assume that the government
meaning the taxpayer will rescue them
again if necessary indeed credit rating
rating agencies incorporate future
government bailouts into their
assessments of the largest bank banks
exaggerating market distortions that
provide them with an unfair advantage
over smaller institutions which continue
to struggle and of course encouraging
them to that they undertake risky
transactions with a big profit because
when it collapses as it will the
taxpayer will come and bail amount so in
short barosky concludes Obama's programs
were a giveaway to Wall Street
executives and a blow in the solar
plexus to their defenseless victims at
all in accord with Adam Smith's
maxim from the 17 1770s and it's pretty
much the same on foreign policy so take
a few just let's pick a few critical
moments for formation of foreign
policies the global system changed
radically during World War two the
United States emerged from the Second
World War as overwhelmingly the most
powerful state in the world's richest
most powerful and it expected to make
use of that power to organize the world
in the interests of the domestic masters
of mankind during the Second World War
President Roosevelt's planners State
Department planners and experts in
florence policy from outside had a
regular meetings in which they planned
for the post-war world they knew that
britain the united states was going to
replace Britain Britain as the global
dominant power and they wanted to lay
out plans to what the world would look
like well it was a one of the leading
British diplomatic historians Geoffrey
Warner recently pointed out after a
study of this that from the documentary
record it's perfectly clear the
President Roosevelt was aiming at United
States hegemony in the postwar world and
not surprising given us power and they
had specific plans they plan to
construct what they called a grand area
which would be under us control that
would include the entire western
hemisphere the Far East and the former
British Empire including crucial the
Middle East energy reserves that's the
minimum the maximum would be as much as
possible certainly the core of the
Eurasia of the economic industrial core
of Eurasia Western Europe well that was
the grand area and in the Grand area
quoting the United States will main
unmaintained unquestioned power with
military and economic supremacy while
ensuring the limitation of any exercise
of sovereignty by states that might
interfere with its global designs and
more significant the wartime plans were
soon implemented this ought to be sort
of the first week of a freshman course
in college and post-war foreign policy
it's very significant and that's
remained that stays the policy and it's
often stated pretty forthrightly so it
takes a Bill Clinton sort of the less
aggressive side his doctrine presented
to Congress was that the United States
has the right to use military force
unilaterally to ensure inhibited access
to key markets energy supplies and
strategic resources and the US must
maintain military forces forward
deployed in Europe and Asia in order to
shape people's opinions about us not by
persuasion and to shape events that will
affect their livelihood and our security
in that special sense of security well
that doctrine Lysa's licenses military
intervention at will and it actually
goes well beyond the much reviled george
w bush doctrine which at least required
pretext for intervention for clinton
indeed a pretext was controlling the
grand area but the clintons doctrine was
presented politely and so it received no
censure unlike the brazen and arrogant
pronouncements of his successor it's
styled it matters not confident but not
that remains
much the same I'll take the invasion of
Iraq which is quite interesting if you
look at it closely throughout the course
of the invasion it became clear that the
u.s. was going to fail who was not going
to achieve its objectives and as the
failure became clear the actual goals of
the invasion could no longer be
concealed with the usual pretty rhetoric
and they were expressed not reported but
expressed by the government so in
November 2007 the Bush administration
produced a declaration of principles
here's the way it's gotta work the
united states forces must remain
indefinitely in iraq and Iraq must
privilege American investors two months
later in january 2008 Bush informed
Congress that he would reject any
legislation that might limit the
permanent stationing of US armed forces
in Iraq or us control of the oil
resources of Iraq pretty straight
standard Rand area doctrine these are
incidentally demands as the United
States had to abandon the shortly after
in the face of Iraqi resistance it was
another step in a major defeat well it's
the the same world war two principles
hold for what's now considered to be the
greatest danger to world order and in
fact is considered the leading foreign
policy issue for the United States
that's the Iranian threat last year was
year of Iran because this terrible
Iranian threat well what exactly is the
Iranian threat it's something rarely
discussed but there actually is an
authoritative answer it was given by the
Pentagon and US intelligence in their
annual report to Congress on the global
security situation highest possible
source
they point out that the Iranian threat
which they take to be very severe is not
a military threat in fact the Iranian
military spending is low even by the
standards of the region and miniscule
fraction of us fended furthermore Iran
they say has limited capacity to
deployed forces abroad and then they
look into its strategic doctrines
military doctrine and they say the
military doctrine is defensive it's
designed to deter an invasion long
enough so that diplomacy can set in
while they of course discuss the nuclear
threat and they say that if Iran is
trying to develop a nuclear capability
that would be part of their deterrence
strategy ok that's the military side of
the threat however it's a very severe
threat one because deterrence violates
grand area principles remember the basic
principle is that no interference with
us actions is to be tolerated and if a
country can deter an invasion or can
deter aggressive aggressive action
that's an interference with our right to
dominate the world so that's a threat
and there's another threat which they
point out that's what they call Iran's
efforts to destabilize the region how is
your n destabilizing the region well by
trying to develop to extend its
influence into neighboring countries by
Iraq and Afghanistan by commercial
extending commercial relations cultural
relations and so on and that's
destabilizes the country in contrast
when we invade those countries and half
destroy them that stabilizes the region
and this is normal practice this is the
normal usage of the term stability it's
used that way all the time sometimes so
extreme it's hard to believe so for
example when the u.s. overthrew the
parliamentary government in Chile and
installed this dictatorship this action
was criticized by an elite leading
foreign policy analysts Jane chase for
one but he said nevertheless it was
necessary to destabilize Chile in order
to impose stability and that's not a
contradiction if you understand the
technical meaning of the words stability
means we run it we own the world
anything that interferes is
destabilizing that's unchallenged at
home of course but not in the rest of
the world and that's significant because
over the years the u.s. capacity to
implement grand area strategy has
declined the strategy is the same
rhetorics about the same but the
capacity to implemented has designed has
declined and for good reasons the peak
of us power in the world was right after
World War two the United States
literally had half the world's wealth
that's unheard a position of
overwhelming military power it's
industrial competitors were either
destroyed or severely weakened and at
that point the ability to implement
policy was simply overwhelming well that
changed through decolonization
reconstruction of the industrial
societies us share of global power
declined remained enormous but it
declined by
say 1970 it was maybe twenty-five
percent of the world's wealth still
colossal but not half by that time the
world was becoming what was called
tri-polar three major industrial centers
one was North America based in the
United States another Europe now
recovered primarily based in Germany and
the third was East Asia at that point
japan-based and now it's the world's
most dynamic industrial region that
china is the core of it in a certain
sense but it's worth import to remember
that china is an assembly plant the more
advanced technology fancy software and
parts and components they mostly come
from the industrial societies on the
periphery of China Taiwan South Korea
and Japan and also from the United
States in there sent to China to
assemble if you take a look at say the
trade a lot of talk about the trade
deficit with China however if you
calculate that trade deficit correctly
in terms of what's called the
value-added in China to the two what you
purchase say if he purchase an ipod how
much of the value is actually added in
China turns out that the trade deficit
with China is overestimated by about
twenty-five percent and it's
underestimated with Japan South Korea
and Taiwan by roughly the same so yes
it's a growing important country but
it's really the industrial region that's
growing well the let's take a look at
the Latin America in Grand area strategy
it was just taking for granted that we
control that in America period it's our
backyard Henry stem
secretary of war under Roosevelt
described that is our little region over
here which has never bothered anybody
that's as he was working to ensure that
other regional alliances all over the
world would be dismantled a while Erin
would be strengthened go on to say the
early seventies Richard Nixon at the
time when the next administration was
planning the destabilization of Chile in
order to impose stability at that time
the National Security Council the
highest planning body pointed out that
if we don't control Latin America we how
are we going to control the rest of the
world that's the easy one so we better
make sure we control that in America
well that's changed in the last ten
years South America for the first time
in half a millennium since the European
explorers came South America has begun
to move towards independence towards
integration countries integrated with
one another requisite for independence
and also towards addressing some of
their horrendous internal problems by
now the United States has been kicked
out of every military base in Latin
America and South America that's
the Bush and Obama administration's had
hoped to maintain a couple of aces in
Colombia the one country that's more or
less under control but the Colombian
Constitutional Court has so far blocked
it actually the one the one remaining a
major military base in that continent it
outside of North America is in Honduras
and very likely less large part of the
reason why the unit what Obama broke
with Latin America and in fact with most
of the world by supporting the military
coup in Honduras leaving a highly
represses in brutal regime but with the
military base intact well last februari
februari a year ago a new organization
was formed the community of latin
american and caribbean states CELAC it
included all states of the hemisphere
apart from the US and Canada anything
like that was just unthinkable in
earlier years they're going to have
their first meeting in July and would be
worth keeping an eye on if that
functions that's a harsh blow to us
domination of its traditional backyard
well control of the Mara a lot of Latin
America was regarded from the very
beginning as central to grand area
doctrine and affect us way beyond back
to them under a doctrine but it was
nowhere near as crucial as control of
the vast energy resources of the Middle
East what President Eisenhower called
the most strategically important area of
the world the State Department described
it as the stupendous source of strategic
power probably the richest economic
prize in the world in the field of
foreign investment and that was a prize
that of course the US
intended to keep for itself and its
allies in the unfolding new world order
after the Second World War well despite
changes and there have been plenty
planners still adhere to the doctrine
that was expressed shortly after the war
by one of Roosevelt's leading advisers a
burly who said pointed out that if we
can control Middle East energy resources
we will have substantial control of the
world it's not a small issue and it
follows that loss of that control would
threaten the proper whole project of
global dominance that was clearly
articulated during World War two and has
been implemented and sustained to the
extent possible since that day despite
major changes in World Order well right
now that's threatened that's the
significance of what was happening it's
been happening for the last couple of
months in the Arab world a spectacular
display of courage dedication commitment
by popular forces outcome is uncertain
but a lot has been achieved and it's
this is extremely threatening to the
United States because it's threatening
to bring democracy and democracy if it
means anything it means that the will of
the population has some effect on policy
not just the Masters and that's really
the threat domestically too and we know
what the will of the population we know
a lot about what the will of the
population is now it's not reported and
it's known but not reported but
obviously not on the planet there are
studies carried out by the major US
polling agencies they're released by
prestigious institutions like the
workings in student washington and
they're very very striking so take a gyp
the most important country
in Egypt ninety percent of the
population regard the United States as
the major threat to their interest in
fact they're so critical of US policy
that about eighty percent think the
region would be more secure if Iran had
nuclear weapons to counter us-israeli
domination and the figures are very
small percentage maybe ten percent in
the region think of Iran as a threat
well the figures vary from country to
country but roughly like that well as I
say it's not reported there's not a
single report in the United States in
the mainstream you find it but the edges
but obviously planners know all about it
well there's there's a principle behind
it the principal was expressed quite
accurately by the head of the Carnegie
Endowment the Middle East research
program the former high Jordanian
official that Marwan Masha and what he
pointed out is that as long as the
populations are under control and they
are passive and apathetic then the
powerful can do will be like what they
like so therefore it's fine to this
resort public opinion until they get out
of control which is what's happening now
now that's an old principle and again if
the media schools universities were
doing their job everyone would know what
I'm going to say because it's quite old
and important go go back to say 1958
President Eisenhower the President
Eisenhower was concerned about public
opinion in the Arab world he was
concerned about what he called a
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and not by the government's
which are more or less under control but
by the people and in that same year the
National Security Council for produced
memory
long be classified which gave the
reasons it said there's a perception in
the Arab world that the United States
supports harsh and brutal dictatorships
and that we oppose democracy and
development and we do it because we want
to gain can make me maintain control
over their energy resources and went on
to say that this perception is more or
less accurate and furthermore that's
what we ought to be doing on the
operative principles of foreign policy
and World Order so as long as the washer
doctrine holds populations are
controlled we don't care if it as a
campaign of hatred will go on and
control their resources and support
democracies and dictatorships and block
democracy and development well move on
to George Bush number two after nine
eleven as you'll recall he gave a kind
of a plaintiff speech in which he asked
you know why do they hate us and he
concluded that they hate our freedom
right after that the Pentagon initiated
research study and Science Board which
concluded responded to him he said no
they don't hate our freedom they hate
our policies another end was essentially
a repetition of what the national
security council had said in 1958 they
didn't add what we should conclude it's
not that they hate our freedom it's that
we hate their freedom and there's a good
reason because if they're free they're
going to follow the policy the will of
the population and that means the u.s.
is just not be driven out of the region
that's obvious from the campaign of
hatred and 58 and everything since and
the contemporary polls we saw a pretty
dramatic demonstration of how educated
elite opinion interprets that right now
striking that there wasn't anything
arianna they all followed WikiLeaks i'm
sure the most of the wikileaks exposures
the one that received the most attention
in the headlines you know if
enthusiastic commentary and so on was
that the Arabs support US policy on Iran
the RAM being the main threat to the
world well that's the true of the Arab
dictators which is all they cared about
but it's dramatically false with the
population the population on the
contrary strongly opposes US policy and
even calls for Iran to have nuclear
weapons however as long as the moisture
doctrine holds you know keep the
population or control who care all
educated opinion cares about is the
dictators and as long as they are
supporting us we don't care about the
population is very clearly illustrated
but it is a problem and you can see it
right in front of your eyes day after
day Egypt is still under military rule
has been a real large scale social and
political change but there have been
changes and the new Egyptian government
is more responsive to the popular will
and things are happening that are
considered extremely threatening in the
United States there's good reasons why
we oppose democracy so for example a
couple of weeks ago the Egyptians
permitted Iranian ships to go through
the Suez Canal for the first time in 30
years breaking the US policy of
isolation just a couple of weeks and a
couple of days ago in fact Egypt
organized a unification agreement
between the two major Palestinian
factions Hamas and gas
 off the risk that again is a very
Israel reacted very harshly us did too
and for good reasons for about 20 years
a major US Israeli policy has been to
separate Gaza from the West Bank it's in
the violation of the Oslo agreements
1993 which described him as a
territorial unity that you know that was
the policy and it's been pretty
successful but the unification agreement
if it holds might overcome that
furthermore unification might make it
easier might ease the way towards
diplomatic negotiations for a political
settlement of the israel-palestine
conflict that's been one one of the ways
of holding that off has been to claim
the Palestinian martyr partner for peace
well if you look at the record again
this doesn't get reported that's easy to
discover for 35 years the United States
has unilaterally been blocking a
political seven its alone in the world
on this along with this you can see it
in Security Council votes vetoes General
Assembly resolutions public statements
and so on and in fact if the unification
agreement facilitates the path towards
negotiations us and Israeli isolation is
going to become so dramatic that it's
going to be hard even for the press
because it's not to report it well
that's certainly most of the rest of the
world understands so that's dangerous
now the New York Times warned about
something else which they are concerned
about very much namely the 1979 peace
treaty between Israel
he did the times reported the concerns
in Washington that that treaty might be
threatened it's very unpopular among
Egyptians and the treaty they said is a
cornerstone of the region's stability
well there's that nice word stability
again actually the peace treaty is
actually a cornerstone of the region's
instability very dramatically when the
peace treaty was signed in 1979 there's
an interesting history which I won't go
into but when it was signed Israel
responded rationally they concluded that
Egypt which is the main deterrent to his
Israeli actions only major military
force in the Arab world so if Egypt
neutralized Israel could move ahead much
more freely a torts integrating the
occupied territories to the extent
taking them over to the extent that it
wanted all the legal of course and also
by attacking its northern Native Lebanon
which they proceeded to do right away
major attack killing tens of thousands
of people well that's instability in the
info normal meaning of the world were
but its stability in the technical
meaning because it accords of us plans
so that's why the treaty is called the
cornerstone of the region's stability
kind of like it ran well check the u.s.
reaction to the democracy uprising and
you can see all this plane out very
straightforwardly major principle is
democracy is a real threat so we've got
to do something to deter it well there
are several categories of states the
most important are the oil-rich states
where the dictators are reliable and
obedient likes a Saudi Arabia well
they're they're given free reign to
crush demonstrations because we want to
keep things the way they are Saudi
Arabia for example there was a it was an
effort to have to join me democracy
uprisings but security presence was so
overwhelming that people were afraid to
go out in the streets okay no comment
about that the same thing happened in
quate also a reliable dictator the most
interesting cases Bahrain laraine isn't
all that important in itself except that
it hosts the u.s. Fifth Fleet which is
the major military force in the region
but crucially Bahrain is just a couple
miles from Saudi Arabia off the coast it
has a majority Shiite population eastern
Saudi Arabia right next door is also
majority Shiite and both have sunny
dictatorships and as unhappy happens to
be where most of Saudi oil is says
they're deep concern that the major oil
resources in the region eastern Saudi
Arabia and southern Iraq southwestern
Iran well mostly Shiite might fall under
Shiite control which might move towards
independence so therefore any democracy
movement in Bahrain has to be crushed
and if it has been crushed violently
duty to the city but military invasion
gave the Bahraini security forces the
capacity to you know destroy it in 10
cities and destroyed tougher that their
version of Tahrir Square curl square
break into the hospitals empty the
hospitals throughout the doctors and the
patient capture kitten tortured human
rights activists it's a real horror
story going on right now a destroying
 mosques all kinds of atrocities
virtually no comment that's necessary to
keep thee for the stability of the
reliable obedient oil-rich dictators
well take the countries that don't have
that had dictators with not a lot of oil
and so for example Egypt and Tunisia
well in those cases the u.s. followed a
very standard game plan I'm you have to
be kind of blind not to see it over and
over again through the years some
favored dictator gets into trouble and
the procedure is always the same say you
know somoza and Nicaragua Marcus and the
Philippines and China and South Korea
Bhutto in the Congo the heart of an
Indonesian is case after case what you
do is support them as long as possible
and if it becomes impossible supporting
like for example if the army turns
against him then she'll then send them
away somewhere and try to restore the
old regime as much as possible maybe
with new names it's exactly what's going
on in Egypt and into isi's right in
front of our eyes a very familiar
pattern sometimes it works sometimes it
doesn't but that's the policy well that
leaves one other category an oil-rich
dicked dictator who isn't reliable and
there is such a case that's Libyan and
here's what the earth is done it's very
and Britain worked together very
striking they've strongly supported
Qaddafi I don't have time to go into the
details if you like but up till the
present they've been very strongly
supporting him but now this chance to
get rid of them and so that's what
they're trying to do just done before I
came over here I was listening watching
BBC on television now they're perfectly
frank about it the reporting says yeah
we support the rebels that's what we're
doing and the head of NATO was
interviewed he said well no it's
justified because the regional powers
asked us to the Arab League is kind of
half
proof at least the Arab League did call
for a no-fly zone but it immediately
retracted as soon as it saw that the US
Britain and France were going way beyond
the resolution to protect civilians and
we're just remain in the rebellion
there's another small point at the same
time that the Arab League hope for a
no-fly zone over Libya it also called
for a no-fly zone over Gaza to prevent
further us Israeli attacks on Gaza which
has devastated the place that literally
didn't get reported in the united states
except way out at the margins you can
read about it in the international
business breast well that we don't have
to adhere to that call because it
doesn't accord with air our goals well
the in libya this the actual
intervention i mean you can say it's
right you can say it's wrong but at
least we ought to be honest about what
it is it's direct intervention on the
side of the rebels as not protecting so
they didn't just make try to seize our
side and win it's the it's kept the
intervention is carried out by france
britain in the united states note that
those are the three traditional imperial
powers they're doing it in virtual
isolation there's token participation by
NATO or little of in the arab world
where this huge military forces in egypt
saudi arabia nothing to be involved a
couple of reconnaissance planes from
qatar africa it's an African country the
African Union is going for diplomacy
they don't want to be involved they
don't want the intervention the major
regional power turkey also huge military
they do that they're not trying to
impose any no-fly zone don't have
anything to do with it the so-called
BRICS countries Brazil Russia India
China and South Africa remain emerging
country since most of the world they
just completed a conference in China and
they came out with a declaration
opposing any military force in Libyan
calling for negotiations diplomacy well
again you can have whatever opinion you
like but the confirm the facts are quite
clear the Imperial triumph or it is
isolated they are acting alone another
sign of the decline and the capacity to
rule the world just getting more free
and open and the same is true in the
case of Iraq the United States is
extremely isolated on that the
non-aligned countries that's most of the
world they've been supporting two runs
right to would enrich uranium vigorously
from the beginning well we don't care
about them the region I've already
mentioned in the region public opinion
overwhelmingly supports not only Ron's
right to develop nuclear energy but even
to have nuclear weapons well the macho
doctrine tells us we can ignore the
regional population the same is true of
turkey major power which is nothing to
do with the isolation factor increasing
marvel relations with Iran same is true
of Brazil the most respected country in
the south well the United States can
tolerate Turkish and Brazilian
disobedience though with some dismay
with this another country that's harder
to ignore that's China the press warns
that China's investors and traders are
now filling a vacuum in Iran as
businesses from other countries mainly
Europe pull out in response to us
demands
and in particular China's expanding its
dominant role in Iran's in and energy
industries and Washington nah need them
like it but it's reacting with it
touches real desperation so the State
Department recently warned China that if
it wants to be accepted in the
international community meaning by the
US then it must I'm quoting skirt and
Eve it must not skirt and evade
international responsibilities which are
clear what are the international
responsibilities well to follow us
orders China does observe UN sanctions
because they're mostly toothless and
they're criticized but it here for that
but they're not following unilateral us
sanctions and therefore they are not
meeting their international
responsibilities that is just elicits
laughter in the Chinese Foreign Office
the real threat of China is they just
can't be intimidated I mean their
picture is look we've been around for
3,000 years major civilization in the
world where we have been fending off the
barbarians we don't care about them now
and that's
that's frightening
I mean if you're the Matthew Don and
people stop following orders you're in
serious trouble so that's just main
thread of China now there's also talk
about a military threat and in fact the
Pentagon just released study of it they
say that China's military budget is
approaching one-fifth of what the
Pentagon spent to operate and carry out
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that a
small fraction of US military spending
which is roughly the same as the world
combined the new york times reported
that china's expansion of military
forces might deny the ability of
american warship to operate in
international waters off china's coast
what about international waters off the
US Coast like say in the Caribbean Sea
the Chinese Navy deploying there just
imagine what would happen if they did
the strategic analysis literature is
quite interesting the technical
literature it speaks of a classic
security to not dilemma in the us-china
confrontation each side regards its
primary interests at stake so China's
interests are the territorial waters
right over near its border and our
interest is that the waters right near
China's border that's a classic security
dilemma that's hard to deal with and of
course makes sense if the u.s. controls
most of the world you look at the
intellectual journals like the Republic
recently expressed its concern about the
fact that China sent ten warships
through international waters just off
the Japanese island of Okinawa which
indeed is a provocation unlike the fact
which they don't mention that Washington
long ago
the island into a major military base in
defiance of the vehement protests of the
people of Okinawa that's not a
provocation on the standard principle
that we own the world well actually
there is good reason for China's
neighbors to be concerned about its
growing military and commercial clout
and in the Middle East although our
public opinion supports an Iranian
nuclear weapons program I don't we
certainly shouldn't do so we should try
to do something to reduce or eliminate
that the nuclear weapons program not on
Iran but everywhere the foreign policy
well how how can we do it foreign policy
literature is full of suggestions but
there's one that's missing the one that
can work namely move to establish a
nuclear weapons free zone and Middle
East that's here's another case where
the u.s. is almost totally isolated
there are regular review sessions of the
non-proliferation for the
non-proliferation treaty the latest was
about a year ago international support
for a nuclear weapons free zone was so
overwhelming that Obama had to formally
agree however he insisted that there be
a qualification namely Israel has to be
exempted and of course the u.s. is self
exempted from all international
obligations important fact not discussed
so what he said is it's a fine idea but
this isn't the time and furthermore the
u.s. insisted no proposal can call for
Israel's nuclear program to be placed
under the auspices of the International
Atomic Energy Agency or can call for
release of information about Israeli
nuclear facilities and activities
including information pertaining to
previous nuclear transfers to Israel and
of nuclear weapons free zone well these
policies can persist as long as we obey
here the mirage or doctrine as long as
we don't do anything about it yeah then
we can face the possibility of the
Iranian nuclear threat and very volatile
region although there is a solution
actually it's rarely noted in fact
almost never that the US and Britain
have a special responsibility to move to
a new
weapons free zone in the Middle East is
a very good reason for that when the US
and Britain invaded Iraq they tried to
construct a legal cover wreath in legal
covers fell apart pretty soon they cover
was that Iraq you'll recall I'm sure
Iraq it was developing weapons of mass
destruction and it was there for
violating a Security Council resolution
of 1991 which called on them to
eliminate there that we went deep
programs well we know the fate of that
but putting that aside to go back and
look at that Security Council resolution
it committed the signers to work to
establish a nuclear weapons-free zone in
the Middle East so the US and Britain
above all other countries have a special
responsibility for this and US isolation
in blocking it is a serious threat to
the world and shouldn't be tolerated
that that's up to us nobody else can do
anything well the mentioned that the
doctrines the hegemonic doctrines that
were formulated during world who are to
live there still prevailing at least
rhetoric but the power to implement them
is notably declining some of the major
reasons are actually domestic the
American Society now the last 30 years
is being quite consciously undermined by
the Masters of mankind at home that
since the 1970s there's been a very
sharp change in the economy moved from
production to financialization the back
at that time financial institutions were
a small fraction of the economy and
they're doing what they're supposed to
do in a state capitalist economy they
were taking unused resort
feels like somebody's bank account and
transfer them to productive use that's
what they're for that's long since the
1970s that's almost totally gone by now
they're not a few percentage of the
economy by 2007 right before the crash
is they created now they had forty
percent of corporate profits and their
activities have maybe no social utility
may be harmful effects they don't
contribute to the health of ciety their
ways that make it tons of money by
financial manipulation and trickery well
there's our time to go into details but
if you look into it there's been a
variety of factors since the 1970s that
have interactive kind of converge to
create a vicious cycle of radical
concentration of wealth which is mostly
in the top fraction of 1% of the
population that means CEOs hedge fund
manager hedge van hedge fund managers
and so on such a small percentage of the
population is not even captured by the
census figures if the careful analysis
to find it that's the main source of the
extreme inequality well then we go to
Adam Smith's maxon the concentration of
economic power leads to concentration of
political power which in turn leads to
state policies dobrev policies that
increase this concentration fiscal
policies like taxation like say when
John Boehner says everything's on the
table except raising taxes for the rich
things like there's plenty more like it
rules of corporate governance
deregulation which is great for the
financial institutions leads to repeated
crashes and a lot more so you have this
vicious cycle at the same time part of
it is that the costs of electric
electoral campaigns are skyrocketing
which drives the political parties
deeper into the pockets of concentration
of capital increasingly financial
capital for the Republicans just
reflects it for the Democrats who is a
they are now what used to be called
moderate Republicans for them but
they're not far behind
whoa oh this is going on and income and
wealth and power I'm extremely narrow
concentrated for most people for the
last 30 years real incomes have pretty
much stagnated the people have been
getting by with increased work for hours
way beyond Europe now the debt and asset
inflation like the housing bubble which
is regularly destroyed by the financial
crisis crisis that began as soon as the
regulatory apparatus began to be
dismantled under Raven now none of this
makes any difference it's fine for the
very wealthy especially for the
financial institutions which are at the
heart of it they benefit from the
government insurance policy that Neil
Barofsky mentioned what's pulled too big
to fail so what that means is the banks
and the investment firms to make risky
transactions they get rich rewards that
happens with the risky transaction and
you can ignore what the Economist call
an externality something that doesn't
figure in market transactions in this
case it's systemic risk the risk that
the whole system will collapse if
something goes wrong with your
transaction but you that's a footnote
forget about it well inevitably the
system crashes and then what they can do
is run to the 90 state that they nurture
and ask for a taxpayer bailout clutching
their copies of Hayek and Milton
Friedman and nine Rand and so on now
that's been a that's been a regular
process since the Reagan years each
crisis is more extreme than the last to
the public that is real unemployment in
the
at the level of the Great Depression for
much of the population goldman sachs
meanwhile the main architects of the
current crisis they are richer than ever
bigger than ever and they've just
quietly announced 17 and a half billion
dollars in compensation for last year
with CEO Lloyd Blankfein receiving at
twelve and a half million dollar bonus
and his base salary more than triple but
we have to make sure that he doesn't get
taxed because that would harm jobs you
know I won't talk about elections there
just by now a charade run by the pr
industry
well as the early skim the surface of
these critical issues but I don't want
to end without mentioning one more
externality that is dismissed in market
systems now that is the fate of the
species if you're the CEO of a
corporation or investment bank that's
something you don't take into account
and market transactions it's an
institute it's a fact about market
systems well systemic risk in the
financial system that can be remedied by
the taxpayer but nobody's going to come
to the rescue if the environments
destroyed and that we should recognize
as close to an institutional imperative
as things now stand business leaders
business leaders are quite openly
declaring that they're conducting
massive propaganda campaigns to convince
the population that anthropogenic global
warming human contributions global
warming is just some kind of liberal
hoax now the people who are carrying out
these campaigns they understand
perfectly well that the threat is very
grave but they have a institutional role
they have to maximize short-term profit
and if they don't somebody will be
kicked out and somebody also come in who
will do it that's a institutional fact
not an individual one which makes the
problem much more severe now this
particular vicious cycle could well be
lethal and to just get a sense of how
the how serious the threat is it's
really enough to have a look at the new
Congress that came in propelled into
power bi business funding and propaganda
almost all our climate deniers now
they've already been cutting measures
that might mitigate environmental
catastrophe kind of a one indication of
how far the country has shifted to the
far right is that they're basically
trying right now one of the things that
try to destroy the environmental
protection agency that was instituted
under Richard Nixon who was in fact the
last of the rural president literally
worse still a number of them are really
true believers like the head of one of
the the newly elected Republican
congressman is a head of one of the
subcommittee's on the environment as you
may have read he explained that the
global warming can't be a problem
because God promised Noah that there
wouldn't be another flood you know if
that was happening in some tiny country
somewhere we could laugh but not when
it's happening in the richest and most
powerful country in the world and before
we laugh we might also bear in mind that
the current economic crisis is traceable
in substantial measured to a fanatic
faith in dogmas and such dogmas as the
efficient market hypothesis and in
general to what Nobel laureate Joseph
Stiglitz 15 years ago called the
religion that markets know best that
made it unnecessary the religious faith
made it unnecessary to notice an eight
trillion dollar housing bubble that had
no basis whatsoever in economic
fundamentals and devastated the economy
when it inevitably burst well it's
useful to contemplate what's being done
in the richest and most powerful country
in human history hours and in the
poorest country of South America so in
the u.s. that Congress is taking the
lead in undermining any hope for
preventing catastrophe and that again is
driven by deeply rooted institutional
factors not dead people first country in
South America is Bolivia that's taken
the lead internationally in efforts to
protect the environment it says
most recent effort couple of weeks ago
was to pass legislation granting rights
to the natural world now sophisticated
Westerners can ridicule such knifed a
but unless we can gain some of the
sensibility of the indigenous majority
and deliver the last laugh maybe on us
well all of this and a lot more can
proceed as long as the washer doctrine
prevails as long as the population is
passive apathetic angry beverage the
consumerism hatred of the vulnerable and
so on as long as that remains true then
the powerful can do as they like and
those who survive can contemplate the
ruins but we all know that we don't have
to obey them washer doctrine that's what
we're here for right now we're
we're here right now to celebrate 75
years of courageous refusal to do it
with many noteworthy successes and that
leave they leave a legacy the legacy
that we can carry forward often been
done in the past it's being done right
now in Tahrir Square and many other
places under conditions far harsher than
those that we face so fortunately the
future is very much in our own hands
like hear you speak a little bit about
you know the topic but us educate system
particularly in light before we're
seeing around the country cousin
people know you let him just go without
bra well that's a really important issue
the the public education system was one
of the real major achievements of this
country was the first country to have a
really broad mass education system that
contributed enormously not only to the
cultural health of the country but to
its economic growth that after the
Second World War there was a major
period of economic growth in the US
history was the several decades after
the Second World War and a substantial
reason for that was the GI Bill which
allowed a huge number of people not
enough unfortunately but a huge number
of people to go to college who had never
been able to do it and in those days
college was chief public education was
free I mean I went to college in 1945
and I happen to go to the look I went to
a local school you know you never
but the local school happened to be the
University of Pennsylvania which which
is private but it was a hundred dollars
you know and that you could get it any
could easily get a scholarship so
education was basically free and for the
GI Bill of the huge number of people and
that had an enormous impact so all
that's being reversed there's an attack
on public education which is with out
any precedent because all the way from
kindergarten up to the university's so
take say the university's let's play a
personal experience a couple of months
ago I travel around a lot giving talks I
happen to give a talk at in Mexico City
at the National University putting
impressive University couple hundred
thousand students very high level very
engaged in fact salaries is ridiculously
low by our standards that they were
facilities are pretty good it's free
that's a poor country you know but
public education is free furthermore in
mexico city itself there's a city-run
college which is not only free but has
open admissions so anybody can go and if
they need help to get in to get remedial
training i was there too pretty
impressive is also high standard well
that's a poor country i happen to go
from there to the Bay Area in California
this may be the richest place in the
world outside of Gulf emirate they the
public education system is being
systematically destroyed tuition is so
high in the major universities that it's
just for the rich it's a fact it's at
the level of Ivy League colleges work
for this year for the first time more
funding for the public institutions is
coming from tuition than from the state
in a rich state not Mexico
this is happening all over the country I
mean a majority of the states by now the
tuition in the public universities is
higher than funding now it's not because
of the lack of wealth and it's not
because of the deficit which is complete
farce such as easily the show it's
because of the decision to destroy
public education the in California for
example the great universities which are
being will be proud almost certainly be
privatized they're almost private now
you know very high tuitions that big
endowment and so on and that means the
rest of the system system it gets kind
of lowered to low level technical
training well you know for the economy
forget the human cost for the economy of
California that's very serious
california became rich in large measure
because of the high level education
system while the people who are running
the program that top one-tenth of one
percent of the population they don't
care i mean there are kids will be fine
you know they don't use the public
education system that's privatized they
can pay for it a phenomenal wealth and
there's a change and this is generalizes
over the country we have to recognize a
significant change in the nature of
contemporary state capitalism from the
70s you go back to the 1950s the CEO of
a firm's a general motors had to care
about the future of the firm that had
had brand loyalty you know the firm had
to persist and so on so they tried to
build it so it would persist that's not
true anymore a CEO say General Electric
which is mostly financial institutions
Oh left do is make money in the short
term I mean it and then
personally get bailed out by the
taxpayer if it was wrong but if the
company itself declines it doesn't
matter they walk away with their golden
parachute that's the new system and as
for the country they don't really care
about it along with the financialization
of the economy came offshoring of
production so if you can make more
profit by using a super cheap exploited
labor and China let's say without
environmental constraints and so on fine
it happens to harm this country severely
but that's not their concern so we're
getting into a situation where the
future of the country just doesn't
matter for the people for the decision
maker and it's going all the way down to
elementary school and wants to tell you
there's a huge attack on teachers I'm in
an effort to try to shift the blame for
for for the financial crisis and a
general economic crisis away from you
know Goldman Sachs to the public school
teachers and the firefighters if there
is
so ludicrous you can hardly believe that
it getting away with it and there is a
backlash like in Wisconsin significant
backlash but it's certainly going on and
it is absorbed so you're right there's a
major effort to destroy the public
school system now I think there's a
fundamental reasons behind that it's not
just that the rich don't care I think
the same thing lies behind the attack on
Social Security Social Security is a
phenomenally successful program has
almost no administrative costs I mean
far less than privatized insurance and
so on very cheap works very well keeps a
lot of people alive it doesn't mean much
two people in higher income levels you
know they get a small amount they can
forget it but for a lot of the
population that's what keeps them
surviving particularly after the huge
economic collapse collapse of the real
estate bubble so why attack Social
Security well partly it's of no benefit
to the rich but there's a deeper reason
I think it's think it's the same reason
as the public education system I can't
prove it but this is what it looks like
to me the public education system and
Social Security are based on a certain
principle namely the principle that we
care about other people
Social Security means you care that
disabled Widow across town than a foodie
or let's say I don't have kids in school
but you know I'm happy to pay school
taxes because I care that the kid of
course is pretty good so this concept of
sympathy and social solidarity is
considered extremely dangerous there's a
major effort propaganda effort to try to
drive into people's heads they should
only be concerned for yourself now
there's nothing new about this you go
back and Americans good to learn know
about American history you go back to
say 1850 the beginnings of the
Industrial Revolution and incidentally
the period of the freest press in the
United States there are hundreds
thousands of newspapers a lot of
readership the direct participation they
were written affected workers and others
and one of the main scenes that was
angered at what was called the new
spirit of the age gaining wealth
forgetting all but self that was the new
spirit of the age in 1850 and has been a
tremendous effort over the years to
somehow drive that into people's heads
and drive out all normal human feelings
and you know it's had some success and I
think you see it in the willingness of
parts of the population at least to try
to kill the elements of the society and
the culture that are based on care and
concern for other people and to try to
turn people into crazed maniacs who care
about nothing but themselves well that's
all that's pretty dangerous again it was
happening some small country
the shame but when it's happening in the
richest most powerful country in history
it's very dangerous by the water water
for you how many people who understands
some delicacies of how our system Walker
isn't outside the world and in your body
you know why you are you always say come
to one conclusion that seems to be the
very same system and the system is Paul
and these are systematic errors that
even one good before placed in certain
musicians they don't want a good job to
get barred somebody else places to push
you but they too I get the impression
there
system that seems to be going against
what's a synthetic human nature let's
say that in office on this road became
the dominant voting bloc in the u.s. do
whatever you want what should you change
in order to make our system such that it
works along with better our community
make it less profitable wars make it
more profitable between so one dimension
is something like that possible well
sure we know it's I think it's important
point we know that it's possible because
it's been done over and over again I
mean that's why we don't live under
feudalism we don't have slavery women
have some rights and yes it's because of
things like that and it's a lot of its
in very you know our own recent
lifetimes so what the society is what
more civilized than it was say 50 years
ago and a lot of respect the there are
there have been repeated periods through
American history when there's been a
struggle a popular struggle against the
effort to turn human beings into you
know satanic creatures and it succeeded
over and over like takes a financial
crisis okay the immediate causes the
current economic crisis there weren't
any financial crisis from from 19 from
the Second World War up until reagan
none and the reason is there was a
regulatory apparatus in place there's a
regulatory apparatus which comes out of
the New Deal and the New Deal wasn't a
gift from
oh it came from very extensive popular
struggle CIO organizing you know
sit-down strikes and mass demonstrations
all sorts of things and that's my
childhood I remember and that left a
legacy which the fertile men like the GI
Bill like a substantial economic growth
egalitarian in the fifties and sixties
not like what's happened since and
things like say a regulatory apparatus
which contain the tame the worst
excesses of the system the deficiencies
are still there but their ways of remedy
same with health care like now there's a
battle to try to save Medicare for the
elderly and Medicaid for the poor but if
you go after 50 years there was nothing
to say if they came because of the
activism of the nineteen sixties which
got the government to do something not
as much as they should at least
something now it take a look safety at
the famous deficit for the business for
the financial institution they want
everybody to focus on the deficit you
get rid of the deficit it's good for
bankers this it's not the problem of the
country the problem the country's
joblessness and that requires stimulus
not that it's not a story
let's even put that aside suppose we buy
into the propaganda and say okay we're
worried about the deficit where's it
come from well about half the deficit is
military spending you know the you all
know this the u.s. spends about as much
as the rest of the world combined it's
not for security as I mentioned is
harming security as other purposes like
the ones the claimed invention so that's
half the deficit where's the other half
the other half comes from the completely
dysfunctional healthcare system and it's
a privatized unregulated healthcare
system then it's an international
scandal has twice the per capita costs
or more of comparable countries some of
the worst outcomes a huge number of
people with no coverage at all well you
know it's not if our health care system
was the same as other industrial
countries there would not only not be a
deficit that would be a surplus ok now
it's not utopian to think that we can
have a we can radically cut a military
system that's dangerous for the world
and harm for us and it's certainly not
utopian to think that we can have a
health care system like other countries
that's not utopia but those things
aren't discussed and they're not
discussed because of the you know the
control of the doctrine and debate and
discussion by a the same narrow
concentration of power or setting these
pauses well you know that's this I mean
people you take a look at people's
attitudes it turns it's very strike is a
heavily cold country you know a lot
about what people think and it's worth
looking so for example there there
recent studies of that sector of the
population that says you know get the
government off our backs let's have a
small government that that kind of
sentiment you take a look at what their
what their attitudes are it turns out
their Social Democrats literally they
think there should be more money spent
on education on health on more money
should be used for helping poor people
like women with dependent children but
not welfare not welfare but all the
things that welfare does and the reason
is because welfare has been demonized
ever since Reagan welfare means black
women you know being chauffeured to the
welfare station with in there by their
chauffeur Cadillacs and picking up your
money well okay nobody wants that so
let's get rid of welfare but let's keep
or in fact increase that all the things
that welfare does that one of the most
striking cases is foreign aid a huge
number of people oppose the foreign a
way too high when they're asked what
they think foreign aid is they give
estimates you know baby on the miser z
level that it is when they're asked what
they think it ought to be twice as high
as it is well you know this generalizes
the people are resistant to these
efforts to turn them into monsters but
if you're sitting alone you know
listening to Fox News and you're not
getting anything else from the Democrats
either you know NVR well you know you
get muddled confused and that's what
groups like this or bound to try to
carry out that policies of the programs
of organization that'll enable people to
break out of this now
I've purposely been keeping two
band-aids two very small things that
could be done to make it a much better
society but I think your question
pointed to something deeper what about
the institution's themselves they're not
craving it's done they can be changed
you don't have to have institutions like
that and there's plenty of possibilities
but that's another question for one more
question from his line and I wish to say
that you want to let a young person
inside me just consider that another one
faster this microphone over here and
make the next question hello my name is
and if you said I would live beside
student at the University my house after
I we can't you see you I love tour I ask
you a question I I just want thanking
God does altered a lot of luck I'm
hoping light itself I words the night
Express out that point
christopher hitchens calling for what
you said about us on blonde and Lucinda
okay I'm on a gravel of waking life to
our spot well if I wanted the stoop to
that level there'd be very simple
responses he's been producing hysterical
ranch for 20 years I just ignore them
they're not worth responding to but if
you really want to look also for example
let's take one of his main cases one of
his claims is that I I claimed that the
clintons bombing of the Sudan wood was
worse than 911 are you can check back
and see what i said is its total
fabrication but there's something much
more interesting there are liars and
their brazen liars there is one person
who actually did say that the bombing of
the Sudan was much worse than 911
Christopher Hitchens okay you can find
it I've quoted it okay is there any
point responding to things like it's
kind of like responding to some Soviet
Thomas or what's the point
stock market Robin hundred thirty points
is 80 because white powder billionaire
hedge fund manager for 14 ounces of
value first time in decades at a White
House of times and practicing like this
over financial things with what God
order to that representative represents
a different city enforcement of these
white collar criminals and then just a
secondary question I'm Europe in the US
Europe seem much more intent stronger
regulations the financial institutions
in u.s. wats we play the game is anyone
reviewed over one I wonder if it even
Europe will be America's enemies we
covered over financial regulation I
didn't understand the first part would
you be able to repeat the first part of
that question yeah just underneath the
indictment today a hedge fund
billionaire the first time I think it
who wasn't pregnant she's right somebody
hit a three yeah melly fun oh that one
yeah yeah yeahs straight Robert yeah
he's also Jonathan well you know I'm
Emily he's not being that's a case
that's been going on for a while and
he's not being indicted for things like
the lying and the cheating and the
dishonesty that created the financial
and economic crisis he's being tried for
things that harmed other businesses and
they don't like it you know so they go
they'll go after people who harm their
interest you know I didn't read the
report but if it happened beyond sir
that's icky enforce its enforcement but
nothing very I mean the serious
enforcement ought to be the kind of
things that barosky's talking about
these the Special Inspector for the
bailout I mean there was to repeat what
he said it's important there was a
bargain the bargain is the culprits who
created the disaster will be bailed out
by the taxpayer and the people who were
harmed by them will get at least you
know something I'll put you know maybe
they'll be able to stay in their homes
instead of being thrown out well as he
pointed out half that bargain was kept
the other half was disregarded tells us
something about how democracy functions
the loud voices the rich loud voices
yeah they get their way Adam Smith's
masters of mankind the rest of the
population are you know the wider
doctrine again we can disregard them so
they'll get thrown out of their homes
all right that's a major crime as is the
fact that there is a that these that say
credit rating agencies are now calculate
when they give a credit rating to some
company they count in the likelihood in
fact near certainty that if they go bust
the taxpayer of it Oh bail them out that
makes them a lot more rich and powerful
than they were all right those are real
fundamental forms of corruption I
applaud corrupt the same is true of say
tax policy I mean if you take a look at
tax policy it's pretty amazing so take
say the bush tax cuts which were which
are a tremendous burden on the economy
and if it wasn't for the effect of those
tax cuts we have nothing like the crisis
that there is now well however the tax
cuts design take a look at it they those
of your old enough they remember the tax
cuts were 2001 they were going to run
for 10 years the first year everybody
got a couple hundred dollars in the mail
so you look you're giving you a tax cut
for everybody and it was it was tilted
toward the wealthy because everybody got
something but it was designed so that
year after year that would shift and in
the last year I think it was the top 1%
got over half the tax cuts but by then
everyone had forgotten you know that's
called a sunset policy you design
program so at first they don't look too
bad and then as they begin to take
effect they go to what the Masters want
all for ourselves and nothing for anyone
else what Adams mythical the vile Maxim
of the Masters of Management that's the
way policies design there you go to the
congressional debate now so take john
bainer yesterday everything's on the
table except the bush tax cuts okay
we've got to make sure that the rich get
even
richer and more powerful now there's a
way of talking about this and if you
read his speech it's typical he said we
have to do this because of jobs you
think for a moment has nothing to do
with jobs you want jobs that's not what
you do but we have to remember that
there's been an interesting change in
the English language there's a certain
word which you're not allowed to
pronounce it's an obscene word since
their children in the audience all spell
it instead of pronouncing it PR 0 f I TS
you're not allowed to use that word that
word is now pronounced jobs ok so when
when you read about
these are and here the media just go
along and commentary just goes along and
so on there's a real serious problems or
takes a the debate over a Medicare it's
the Ryan proposal which is supposed to
be serious and courageous we're supposed
to think about it its design on the
sunset policy take a look at it it's
designed to destroy Medicare but not for
the current voting population so people
who are 55 or over which is a big part
of a voting population they're excluded
because their Medicare will stay what's
going to be killed is years down the
road and that's not a small effect
congressional budget office estimates a
34 trillion-dollar costs to seniors over
the life of the program 34 trillion
dollars alright that's what's being cut
for elderly people but not now because
we want them to vote for it now so
they're exempt sunsets policy again
Medicaid is being devastated and what is
being omitted is the source of the
problem Medicare is not a problem
Medicare is pretty efficient has quite
low administrative costs it works pretty
well it's very expensive but the reason
is it works through the privatized
system that's where the costs are the
ridiculous costs you know profits
advertising bureaucracy all kind of
things that's why it's twice as high as
anywhere else well that's not being
touched ok so we're all of this all of
these debates are framed in a way which
kind of guarantee that the rich and
powerful will get more rich and more
powerful and the rest will suffer why
those are real problems but they can be
dealt with you know they didn't have to
be like that
that included a custom anthem period
lovely offer dr. Chomsky a small gift
and appreciation for coming here tonight
we have a memory t-shirt as well as
cultural workers calendar
thank you
