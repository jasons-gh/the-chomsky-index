good evening everyone my name is Eggman
of a survey and I want to welcome you
all on behalf of them the organization
Palestine at MIT and I also want to
thank our co-sponsors
the School of Humanities Arts and Social
Sciences our student organization MIT
Muslim Student Association and MIT world
he will be able to do video cooked
broadcast of this event shortly on MIT
were in the midst of the occurring
misfortunate events that are happening
in the Middle East we thought of someone
who can shed an objective light
regarding the issue and we couldn't
think of anyone better than professor
Chomsky and of course he doesn't need an
introduction but for those who don't
know him everyone knows Chomsky is the
Institute's professor emeritus of
linguistics at MIT Chomsky is credited
with the creation of theory of
generative grammar considered to be the
most significant contribution to the
field of theoretical linguistics made in
the 20th century professor Chomsky
Thanks well I see you managed to find
your way through the maze of room
changes so that's a help we almost were
assigned to the lockheed-martin
room but escaped by a miracle in a way
would have been appropriate for what I'm
gonna talk about the title that was
announced was the current crisis in the
Middle East singular which is a mistake
it's my fault
should have been crises plural because
there are quite a few of them now there
are at least four major ones first is
Palestine which is being systematically
destroyed both of its parts Gaza and the
West Bank
second is Lebanon which has just been
largely destroyed once again
that's the fifth Israeli invasion in 30
years all backed by the United States
which is the part that oughta concern us
the third is Iraq which is hideous
catastrophe and getting worse and the
fourth is Iran which is an impending
catastrophe that couldn't blow up the
whole region and it doesn't take much
imagination to think of others well I'm
gonna say a few words about each of them
mainly the first two at Lebanon and
Palestine which I think are closely
linked so let's start with Palestine
it's commonly recognized and rightly to
be the core of the good deal of the
turmoil and conflict in the region in
much of the world that conflict Israel
Palestine is regarded as the most
serious threat to peace in the world
seems on the surface to be hopeless it's
degenerating into something like tribal
warfare with
the familiar cycle of escalating
violence revenge and fanaticism it's not
entirely false but it's a highly
misleading picture because there is a
very reasonable solution which could
lead to peace and security maybe lay a
basis for something more satisfactory
for the people of the two peoples both
populations and for the region
furthermore it's well known it's also
well known or should be why it's still
only a hope not a reality the basic
outlines of solution were formally
presented at the UN Security Council
thirty years ago in January 1976 it was
a resolution backed by the major Arab
states most of the world supported by
the PLO of the Palestine Liberation
Organization it incorporated the wording
the basic essential wording of what
everyone recognizes on all sides to be
the core diplomatic document UN 242 of
November 1967 incorporated that wording
including recognition of the rights of
all states in the region to live in
peace and security within recognized
borders but it added something to un -
42 - 42 said nothing about the
Palestinians accept their refugees and
something ought to be done for but by
the mid-70s the Palestinian issue had
entered the International agenda and the
January 1976 resolution called for two
states side by side both recognized both
living in peace and security within
recognized borders with some variations
this has been the these have been the
basic
lines of a settlement right up to the
present there's a few changes but not
much Israel refuses to attend instead it
bomb nabatea
town southern Lebanon killing many
inhabitants with any personnel weapons
rockets and bombs that no credible
pretext was ever offered and it's
presumably was retaliation against the
United Nations for daring to consider a
political settlement however there was
no need for Israeli concern big brother
stepped in vetoed the resolution that's
first of several another one in 1980
since then there's a host of General
Assembly resolutions that won't run
through them the votes are usually
something like 150 to two or something
like that
virtually annually Nava Thea was reduced
to ruins
last July once again he's another act of
wanton savagery I could particularly
vivid for several of us here because he
just visited it was a flourish a couple
of weeks ago flourishing hopeful town
welded streets who were welcome to the
homes and now heaps of rubble even
burial grounds for people we met the
1976 resolution was not only supported
by the major Arab states their
confrontation States as that were called
Syria Egypt Jordan but as I mentioned
they were also supported by the PLO
which be announced what it called the
tyranny of the veto after the United
States vetoed it
Israel's UN ambassador time hair SOG who
was later president denounced the
resolution
claimed that it was written by the PLO
which is extremely unlikely it was a bit
paranoid but the paranoia is
understandable Israel has been very
deeply concerned about the prospect of
the threat of peace for quite a long
time and for a very simple reason peace
means the end of expansion and it also
grants rights to the indigenous
population recognises their existence
and that's psychologically difficult for
many people to accept and I continues
until today one of Israel's most astute
and informed commentators for a great
many years or of nary had an article
about a week ago with the headline help
peace mongers it opened like this and it
sort of summarizes what's been going on
for 30 years in the corridors of power
and Jerusalem the cry is going up help
pieces upon you Israel a terrible enemy
is conspiring to impose peace on us he's
advancing against us from two sides and
a giant pincer movement the one arm of
the offensive is the Palestinian unity
government that's about to be set up the
other is the decision of the Arab League
to revive the Arab peace plan of 2002 he
knows what he's talking about
this has been going on for years in fact
1976 which I mentioned was not the first
case the first case and a very important
one was 1971 in 1971 President Sadat of
Egypt offered Israel a full peace treaty
almost exactly in the terms of official
US government policy at the time Israel
recognized it to be a genuine peace
offer the cabinet considered it and
decided
rejected they there was a choice they
preferred expansion to security that
would have meant security would have
been the end of the international
conflict for all intents and purposes
expansion at that time was primarily in
to the northeastern Sinai where Israel
had expelled thousands of farmers driven
him into the desert destroyed towns
mosques of cemeteries leveled the place
in order to establish a new city and all
Jewish City called young meat and a
group of other keeping several keeping
same and other settlements this
incidentally was the Labour government
the regarded as the does real question
was how the US would react would it
continue with its earlier policy
therefore supporting Egypt's peace offer
or would it shift and support Israeli
expansion it was a discussion Kissinger
prevailed
National Security Adviser at the dawn
and the United States adopted his policy
of what he called stalemate meaning no
negotiations just forced that led
directly to the 1973 war which turned
out to be a very close thing for Israel
and it compelled the United States and
Israel to accept Sadat's
1971 proposal took several years but
after many negotiations the United
States finally accepted the 1971 offer
in 1979 at Camp David that is recorded
in US history is a great triumph of us
peacemaking
in fact it was a diplomatic disaster
which
led to a major war virtual serious
threat of nuclear war anguish and
torment for years and was finally
accepted actually the terms that the US
and Israel finally accepted in 1979 were
harsher from their point of view than
the ones that offered in 1971 his 71
offer also said nothing about the
Palestinians just vague mention of
rights of refugees but I said by the mid
seventies the Palestinian national issue
had entered the International agenda so
I brought it up and it was various hand
waving about it
well that 1971 decision which
unfortunately is rarely discussed I
think was one of the most fateful ones
in Israel's history in fact the history
of the region Israel and the United
States had a clear choice the choice was
for Israel one option was for Israel to
integrate peacefully into the region the
alternative was to live by the sword
meaning in particular becoming a US
client state this is another way for it
to live by the sword Israel chose the
second option as I mentioned that almost
led to its destruction in 1973 and it's
proceeding in the same directions since
going right to the president so take
what happened this summer the
destruction of the ongoing destruction
of Palestine and the destruction of much
of Lebanon before our eyes nobody
seriously doubts that that's creating
new generations of jihadis full of
hatred committed to revenge with
consequences that will apply to Israel
and much more broadly
perhaps here as well well Israel is by
no means alone
assigning a low priority to security
preferring in this case expansion
assigning a low priority to secure that
security in comparison with other aims
is pretty standard state behavior for
example its standard for the Israel
superpower patron there's many many
examples most dramatic recent example is
the invasion of Iraq
it was undertaken with the expectation
by intelligence agencies and others that
it would lead to an increase in terror
and nuclear proliferation the dynamics
are understood and it did in fact to a
degree well beyond what had been
anticipated but there were other
priorities and increasing the risk of
terror
maybe nuclear terror maybe nuclear war
is just not a high priority for state
managers many examples history is
replete with examples this threat of
peace has arisen that of Mary talks
about has arisen constantly take 1982
that was the year of the worst the US
Israeli invasion of Lebanon I call it us
Israeli invasion because although the
forces were Israeli the arms are us the
United States provides the diplomatic
support that Evita is resolutions to end
the conflict and so on so the that was
the worst us Israeli invasion and we
understand the reasons it's a pretty
good record immediately after the
invasion Israel's leading scholar
Palestinians at Hebrew University
professor yahushua murat was
incidentally node of explained in
Israel's leading newspaper that israel
was facing what the government regard
as a veritable catastrophe in his words
the veritable catastrophe was
embarrassing embarrassing PLO offers for
negotiations which were becoming harder
and harder to evade that would be a
catastrophes that from point of view of
Israel's governments much better to
drive the fillo back to terrorism and
avoid this dread threat the political
settlement well it was a pretty openly
described at the highest political and
military echelons as a war for the West
Bank and a devastating war there is a
propaganda version which is transmitted
to reporters and commentators Thomas
Friedman is a typical example according
to him the and many others the invasion
was undertaken to protect northern
Israel from Palestinian rockets the only
problem with that is there weren't any
Palestinian rockets there had been a
ceasefire established after conflict a
year earlier the Palestinians had
adhered to it rigorously despite
extensive and sometimes quite murderous
Israeli violations which apparently were
an effort to elicit retaliation would be
which would be a pretext for the planned
invasion when no pretext could be found
someone was invented and the invasion
took place the first act of the invasion
was to bomb Sabra Shatila refugee camp
later the site of a famous or infamous
massacre the flat bombing which opened
the war killed 200 Palestinians in the
camps according to an American Middle
East specialist Cheryl Rubenstein who
was there at the time the invasion went
on to kill maybe fifteen to twenty
thousand more people we really never
know the numbers of our victim
they're not counted the only numbers
that are counted we have detailed
forensic analysis to try to pick up
every piece of bone and so on as
somebody else's crimes but the rough
estimate is in 15 to 20 thousand range
destroyed much of Lebanon the pretext
for the other invasions including the
latest one in July collapse on the
slightest examination I won't run
through them there's plenty in print the
they largely reduce when you look at
them to the same motives same concerns
that one concern is maintaining the
rejectionist stance with respect to
Palestinian rights rejecting it
unilaterally in the world now the second
is maintaining regional dominance for
what has become predictably since 1971 a
US client state by now virtually an
offshore military base in high-tech
center the invasion in July is not much
difference same basic reasons except
there was another one plausible reason
and we don't have internal documents
obviously so anything you say is
speculation but another likely reason
was to eliminate a Lebanese based
deterrent to an eventual attack on Iran
if the US in Israel decided to undertake
well the us-israeli rejection ISM is not
rhetoric it also goes on the DS which is
a lot more important it means
regular projects of settlement than the
occupied territories a huge
infrastructure projects breaking them up
right through the Oslo years the years
of the so-called Oslo peace process from
1993 to 2000 settlement and
infrastructure development continued
steadily steady pace all along us paid
for
the peak was Clinton's last year 2000
also the last year of prime minister
Barak in that year leading right up to
the Camp David meetings settlement
increased the pace of settlement
increased by almost 50 percent but it
was steady then come Bush in Shoreham
that's all accelerated today there's a
euphemism for it
it's called convergence and we're
supposed to praise it as courageous
withdrawal actually the convergence
program announced a couple of months ago
it is a program of the annexation and
dismemberment and imprisonment
explicitly it annexes valuable lands
Israel and exits valuable lands and the
major resources particularly water the
rest of the shrinking territories
assigned the Palestinians are broken up
dismembered and to virtually separated
Canton's all of them virtually separated
from whatever sliver of Jerusalem is to
be left to Palestinians that's the
center of commercial educational
cultural political life and it's all in
prison because Israel's effectively an
Xing the Jordan Valley you look at a map
it's in prison and of course airspace
many other any other axis all of this is
fulfilling goals which were set out
quite clearly in the early days of the
occupation under the Labour government
they were described to the cabinet for
example by Moshe Dayan who was the one
of them among the Israeli leaders one of
the most sympathetic to the plight of
the Palestinians his advice to the
cabinet is was that Israel should tell
the Palestinians and the territories
that we have no solution
you shall continue to live like dogs and
whoever wishes Madeley
and we will see where this process leads
that's the leading principle of the
occupation right up to the present
becoming harsher all the time the black
background reasoning was given by I'm
hair side later president as I mentioned
in 1972 he said I do not deny the
Palestinians a place or stand or opinion
on every matter but certainly I am not
prepared to consider them as partners to
any in any respect in a land that has
been consecrated in the hands of our
nation for thousands of years for the
Jews of this land and that means
everything to the west of the Jordan
there cannot be any parts much of the
leadership it meant east of the Jordan -
well not everyone agreed that one of
those who didn't agree was the hawkish
military governor of the West Bank
general Rommel Ghazi has recently
written his memoirs which are quite
illuminating he describes how the
military government and Israeli military
intelligence forwarded to the political
leadership this remembers the dovish
political leadership kept forwarding to
them proposals for some degree of local
autonomy for Palestinians for what are
called notables you know wealthier
sectors and theirs and so on just some
form of self-government the Israeli
government had no interest at all didn't
even respond just rejected all such
proposals their intent was full Israeli
control what Diane called permanent rule
over the territories and expansion into
the Sinai at that time pretty much the
same policies are carried out within
Israel so just two days ago that one of
Israel's most outstanding journalists
Samir Haas reviewed a new book by
Israeli historian Hillel Cohen is based
on recently released internal records
and it outlines on quota review it
outlines the official paradigm since
1948 continued theft of lands continued
fragmentation and weakening of Arab
society and undermining the possibility
of the Arabs developing an independent
leadership after 1967 same principles
applied to the occupied territories
continuing with Hass the paradigm is
maximum weakening in every possible way
of the Palestinian national collective
so that it will not be able to realize
its goal and establish a state worthy of
the name policies included blocking
education and social and economic
development it was all she says in the
name of security but not for its sake
and the record illustrates that very
clearly
apparently the internal documents spell
out the planning and the rejection ISM
is quite consistent - just to mention
one one other striking moment in 1988
the Palestinian National Council
formally accepted a two-state settlement
on the international border before that
they implicitly accepted it and Israel
had an immediate reaction there was at
the time a coalition government Yitzhak
Shamir and Shimon Peres
and they came out immediately with a
plan stating that the first point was
that there cannot be an additional
Palestinian state in between Israel and
Jordan presupposition is Jordan already
is a Palestinian state they can't have a
second one second position plank plank
was that the fate of the territories
will be decided and accorded with the
guidelines of the State of Israel
that proposal was immediately endorsed
by George Bush number one and James
Baker Secretary of State was called the
Baker plan in December in 1989 which
simply endorsed without comment the
Israeli program that's the most extreme
anti Palestinian position that has
formerly been accepted by any US
government Bush number one is considered
too critical of Israel standard review
and most of this is under the rug but
it's there
the and this goes on in fact to be
precise there has been one break one
week in Taba in Egypt in 2001 there was
a week when Israel Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators that came
together pursuing a peace plan in their
final session after a week they had a
press conference in which they said have
had a little more time
they thought they could iron out the
details and reach an agreement pretty
much along the lines of the
international consensus well they didn't
have any more time Israel Prime Minister
Barak canceled the meetings early and
that's the end of that but that's the
one real break in 30 years of us Israeli
rejection isn't after that negotiations
continued what are called track to
negotiations non official negotiations
with high-level negotiators that
continued finally led to the Geneva
Accord which is released in December
2002 was welcomed by almost the entire
world
Arab states Israel rejected it outright
the u.s. simply just
didn't even respond in fact of all the
major countries the US is the only one
that didn't even send words of greeting
to the Geneva Accords and accordingly it
was simply dismissed and ridiculed in
the US press but it's still they're
going to take a significant change in US
policy for anything like that to be
implemented well among the relevant
actors today this kind of political
settlement slight details changing this
is the narrow form of this settlement is
accepted with near unanimity it's
formally accepted by the Arab League
that's the plan that I'm Terry was
referring to the 2002 Arab League plan
which called for normalization of
relations with Israel full normalization
of relations within a two-state
settlement
it's formally supported by Iran that was
reiterated recently by they call the
supreme leader the Ayatollah Khamenei
who's in charge of foreign policy top
cleric reiterated that Iran accepts the
Arab League plan as far as I'm aware
that hasn't been reported in the United
States it's been accepted repeatedly by
Hezbollah the leader said Nasrallah has
repeatedly stated that as well doesn't
look like doesn't want to recognize
Israel but it's a Lebanese organization
and if the Palestinians
decide to recognize Israel in a
two-state settlement as well I won't
disrupt it they're made statements
indicating pretty clearly that they
accept that plan calling for
negotiations for actually there are only
two significant opponents of what here
is called the George Bush's vision of a
two-state settlement the two opponents
are George Bush
and his administration and Prime
Minister Olmert of Israel just pursuing
the traditional policies of systematic
rejection ISM well the u.s. liberal
media like a journal here prefer a
different story so according to the
Boston Globe a couple of weeks ago
Charles Raiden their Middle East
correspondent according to him Israel is
fighting Hezbollah which like the
Iranian regime its sworn to the
destruction of the Jewish state it just
doesn't matter that they have said
they're willing to recognize it and
accord with the Palestinian and Arab
League proposal and that's pretty
standard it's kind of unfair to pick him
out it provides a useful justification
for u.s. Israeli rejection ISM a
rejection of a political settlement and
insistence on violence well from the
start that's know that's 37 years now
the occupation has been harsh and brutal
there was been no credible security
pretext today there's mounting savagery
there is a policy that was called the
Gaza disengagement to hailed as very
forthcoming in fact it was openly
announced immediately as a West Bank
expansion plan sane Israeli hawks and us
Hawks understood that after Gaza had
been reduced to virtually after decades
of occupation it didn't make any sense
at all to keep a few thousand Israeli
settlers there protected by a large part
of the IDF the Israeli army taking over
I think it was about the third or so of
the most Arab most valuable land and
major resources primarily water that's
pointless makes a lot more sense to
transfer them over to the occupy other
occupied territories mainly West Bank
also Golan Heights well in order to make
it
dramatic they staged was ridiculed by
some Israeli commentators correctly they
staged a national trauma to make it look
just extremely painful and to withdraw
from this area so in fact I'm sure you
remember it was a huge media
extravaganza you know pictures of little
Jewish boy trying to hold back the
soldiers destroying his house and so on
all stage it was a lot of settlers were
allowed in so they could be pretence of
violence it wasn't any but then you
could say well never again never again
what we shall abandon our land that you
know Jews should not suffer so and so on
the withdrawal could have been done
perfectly quietly all that was necessary
was for Israel to announce I was 15 just
to announce them that on August 1st the
IDF the army will withdraw and
immediately these settlers who had been
subsidized to go there in the first
place and to stay there would get on to
the trucks that are provided for them
and move over to the West Bank where
they can move into new subsidized
settlements but if you did it that way
there wouldn't have been no national
trauma any justification for saying
never can we give up another square
millimeter of land and so on what made
all of this even more ridiculous was
that it was a repetition of a staged
trauma in 1982 what was described in
Israel's leading paper arts as operation
trout national trauma in 1982 after
Israel finally agreed to so that's 1971
offer it had to evacuate northeastern
Sinai and there was another stage drama
which again was
Israeli commentators and by a miracle
none of the settlers who were resisting
had even needed a band-aid Palestinians
are being killed all over the place but
you could have the same trauma so that
was carried out meanwhile after the so
called withdrawal Israel maintained Gaza
as a prison Israeli human rights groups
call it the world's largest prison any
access in Iran is controlled by is
really beated Li stop the attacks on
Gaza continued steadily the from
September the withdrawal to June of this
year
144 Palestinians were killed in Gaza
including 29 children Israeli casualties
were zero became worse in January what
happened in January is that the
Palestinians carried a committed a major
crime they voted the wrong way in a free
election and that has to be punished the
US and Israel immediately announced that
they would punish the population for
this Democratic crime they cut off
supplies cut off funds that Israel's
legally obligated to provide they even
went to the extent of cutting off water
which is really gratuitous cruelty in an
area
where water is extremely scarce people
don't have drinking water it's a water
starved region this is nothing new fact
its standard operating procedure there
are many examples in recent American
history famous one or it should be
famous is Chile when they voted the
wrong way Salvador Allende
the US policies there was a soft line
and a hard line now the soft line was to
make the economy scream to punish the
population for voting the wrong way the
hard line was to support a military coup
which led to what's often called in
South America the first 9/11 1973 I
won't go into it but in fact much more
serious than the second 9/11
well that's what you do when people make
the commit democratic crimes and it's
another sign than many other examples
and it's another sign of the visceral
hatred of democracy and a functioning
democracy on the part of the Bush
administration but in fact a lead
opinion pretty generally this goes back
a long time the democracy is fine
under a particular definition democracy
is fine if it comes down to do what we
say or else or else can be pretty brutal
the record is voluminous but it's very
well contained one of the major
successes of containment doctrine in
June to this year 2006 the Israeli
attacks on Gaza escalated according to
the United Nations which keeps a
detailed record in June now there were
40 deaths Palestinian deaths in
Palestine 36 in the Gaza Strip 12
children in June there were three
Israelis that escalated very sharply
after the capture of an Israeli soldier
corporal Gilad Shalit dungeon
25th in the first months after his
capture 171 were killed 34 children
quadrupling the killings Israel
destroyed the power system that means
virtually destroyed it that means most
of the scarce water supply is gone by
mid September
couple of weeks ago and more than 250
Gazans had been killed since July
including at least 45 children 11 women
one of Israel's best reporters the
world's best reporters get on Livy
describes Gaza as now a withered
blighted Garden enveloped in grief and
suffering bearing both in silence as
this hot and lethal summer draws to a
close for the accurate what was the
reason for the June escalation well
there's an official story and we can go
to the Boston Globe this the globe
explained that as follows that said the
attack on military targets inside Israel
meaning the capture of elite the
military action led to an incident
Israeli soldier being taken hostage it
was not merely an arbitrary reflex
within a cycle of vengeance it was
ordered by someone with command
responsibilities and Hamas who could not
be indifferent to the timing of his
action or its political and military
consequences because the hostage taking
operation has brought Palestinians and
Israelis alike to the brink of a new
round of foreseeable disasters it is
crucial that all concerned parties focus
their remedial efforts on the right
address on us that's the editorial the
editors call for the voice of reason
if unreason prevails a tsunami of
unnecessary suffering will break upon
the peoples of the region
well it's useful to bear in mind that
all of this is pure cynical farce that
was
created conclusively the day before the
capture of corporal gali shall eat the
day before Israeli forces June 24th
Israeli forces kidnapped and abducted to
Gaza civilians a doctor his brother than
one our brothers kidnapped they can join
a thousand others somewhere in the
Israeli prisons were also kidnapped
it's called administrative detention
held without charges there are about
8,000 others who were technically
sentenced put in trials that are a
mockery many of them transported from
the occupied territories to Israel which
is another violation of international
law Geneva Conventions but with impunity
because it's under the umbrella of the
outlaw superpower and the reigning
intellectual and moral culture which
permits all of this and clients the the
kidnapping of the brothers was certainly
known but it wasn't reported in The
Boston Globe it was reported a little
bit elsewhere there were scattered
reports pretty marginal quickly
dismissed
The Washington Post had 87 words on it
it was quickly forgotten a kid
kidnapping civilians is a far more
serious crime than capture of soldier
but crimes don't matter when they're
committed by our side just as elections
don't count if they come out the wrong
way now recall that I'm not quoting the
redneck barbarians I'm quoting the voice
of the educated liberal elite in the
Athens of America it's self designated
well that's Gaza West Bank is much the
same there isn't as much massive
violence just random brutality
humiliation
going on for decades now under the
rubric of conversions all totally
illegal the World Court determined that
they were ruling on this separation wool
now the annexation wool determined that
it's totally illegal unanimous even the
US justice who signed a separate
declaration declared any part of the
wall built for defensive Israeli
settlements he said is de facto in
violation of international law but it's
backed by the global ruler so they're
first called moderate and if you read
the press and commentary Prime Minister
Olmert of Israel is praised for his
courageous withdrawal plan to translate
the English is vicious and criminal
maddox ation dismemberment and
imprisonment plan designed with US aid
to drive the final nails into the coffin
of palestinian national rights well
Homer explains soulfully and that he
just has to do it the reason is there's
no Palestinian partner Hamas the party
doesn't qualify nor did its predecessor
it's true that Hamas observed the year
and a half truths despite regular
Israeli atrocities and it called for a
semi-permanent truths during
negotiations for two-state settlement
but that's not enough the US has to
first satisfy three interesting
conditions first it has to recognize
Israel second it has to renounce
violence and third it has to accept
prior agreements well let's just imagine
we had media and journals in the United
States
what would they point out do Israel and
the United States recognize Palestine
Palestine do they renounce violence bad
joke of course not but conditions are
for the weak not for the strong that's a
fundamental
Colonel principle what about accepting
prior agreements well the New York Times
there's delivered a stern lecture on
this too on us they instructed from us
that they must agree to the 2002 Arab
League peace plan quoting announced
quoting The Times since that is an
admission ticket to the real world
a necessary rite of passage in the
progression from a lawless opposition to
a lawful government like others the
time's editors minor fact Israel
forcefully reject this proposal and they
are alone in doing so among the relevant
actors I can go on but times tight so
well the other conditions are even more
ludicrous
well that's Bush's visions famous vision
now being implemented as annexation
dismemberment and imprisonment and the
West Bank imprisonment and destruction
and the other half of Palestine Hebrew
University sociologist or kimerling
describes it as politicize the
destruction of a nation that's something
we don't see very often and in fact we
don't see now either because we're
carrying it out so therefore it's
invisible well that's the first crisis
the second crisis Lebanon on July 12th
Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers
that set off the fierce US Israeli
attack and killed maybe twelve or
thirteen hundred people that destroyed
much of the country aimed at the
infrastructure and the population the
organization Doctors Without Borders its
spokesman reported that it had to use
taxis because ambulances were being
specifically targeted even the US press
did provides
fraction of the hideous story was
actually much worse there is now a
ceasefire and the u.s. delayed the
ceasefire as long as it could to permit
maximum carnage but the killings are
going to continue despite the ceasefire
without a shot being fired in the last
particularly in the last three days of
the offensive after the ceasefire had
been announced but before it was
implemented went into force in those
last three days the IDF has saturated so
there southern Lebanon with over a
million cluster bombs these are
extremely lethal anti-personnel weapons
about a third of them roughly don't
explode on contact they're explode if
you pick them up or hit them with a rake
either that's incredibly bad quality
control or the intention is to render
areas uninhabitable
the death toll right now is reported at
about four a day if a child
little child picks one of these things
up thinks it's a ball is heads blown off
Patrick Coburn and the British press
excellent reporter reports that
Lebanon's farmers are caught in a deadly
dilemma to risk the harvest or to leave
the produce in which they depend to rot
in the fields Israeli artillery officers
who are now being quoted pretty
extensively in the Hebrew press
estimated that the IDF fired a hundred
and sixty thousand shells during the
recent war by comparison in the 1973 war
with Egypt and Syria there was a major
war the idea fired less than a hundred
thousand shells soldiers quoted in the
Israeli press said their orders were in
the last three days to fire everything
they had to destroy everything they
could to turn the region into a
free-fire zone didn't even know what
they were shooting about just like the
master so take Cambodia in Henry
Kissinger's immortal words the orders to
the
Air Force were to hit anything to send
anything that flies against anything
that moves I don't know such an explicit
call for genocide in the archives in any
state but it passes unnoticed here on
July 13th Israeli rockets hit a fuel
storage tank at the main power station
in Lebanon and two days later they
returned hitting the tank again but just
destroying the concrete and earth
barrier that's designed to prevent
spilled oil from spilling into the
Mediterranean sound of a huge oil spill
and of the largest ever and the eastern
Mediterranean it's destroyed the
coastline all I have to syria may reach
Cyprus and Greece that voids Israel
because of the way currents flow many of
you I'm sure read science magazine the
triple-s Journal this latest issue says
that the 15,000 tons have washed ashore
the small proportion of it they reveal
high concentration of cancer-causing
aromatic hydrocarbons much has sunk
below the surface posing further risks
to food chain and difficulties for clean
up the environmental minister of Lebanon
stated that a highly poisonous cloud has
spread over a third of the country an
area that's home to half of its people
from the fire that burned for 12 days it
has high levels of poisonous lead and
mercury highly dangerous
PCBs continuing with him not only have
we been breathing this for a month but
all the agricultural product produce has
been subjected to it even worse
all of these poisons will come down with
the rain some will seep through the soil
and give us a polluted water table then
in a couple of years every single
citizen in Lebanon will definitely be
subjected the poisonous matter in his
drinking water
he expected more lemonade
to die from the pollution and the twelve
thirteen hundred overwhelmingly
civilians who were killed in the war
it's a bigger disaster even in the war
itself notice that all of this is
purposeful you don't miss and targets
like that well what's the reason for the
savagery of the us-israeli assault our
hands there's a standard explanation
like the globe's
Hezbollah committed an intolerable act
of aggression by capturing the soldiers
and again this is pure cynical farce for
decades Israel has been kidnapping
Lebanese civilians in Lebanese territory
on the high seas and transit from Cyprus
to Lebanon holding them for years some
decades sometimes holding them as
hostages
sometimes in secret prison torture
chambers also known secret about this
but not reported in the United States
and of course no one has ever called for
an invasion of Israel and retaliation so
it's all farce complete force withdrawal
from its true and year 2000 Israel
withdrew that's after 22 years of brutal
and murderous occupation in violation of
Security Council orders but with us
support so it was okay since then since
the withdrawal they unify you and
forcing them so keeps very careful
records they report daily violations of
Lebanese territory by Israel in contrast
the number of rocket firings in these
six years attributed to Hezbollah is
zero and there's one possible exception
where the origin is undetermined well if
the world were ruled by justice not
force the expanded unifor force that
we're all reading about it would be not
in southern
but in northern Israel or maybe in
Washington or in Boston well there's a
lot more to say about this but I'll put
it aside and let's turn to the third
crisis Iraq I don't have to describe the
incredible catastrophe for Iraqis you've
read enough about that what should the
u.s. do at this point well there are
some principles one principle is that
invading armies have no rights
whatsoever
they have only obligations and
responsibilities the first obligation is
to pay massive reparations for the crime
of aggression the supreme international
crime according to the nuremberg
judgments which encompasses all the evil
that follows and a second obligation
would be to put on trial the people
responsible for the supreme
international crime well that's the
first is to observe the will of the
victims that's a primary obligation of
an invading force and we know pretty
well what that will is a regular US run
polls taken in Iraq
the most recent one released said that a
couple of months ago that 87 percent of
Iraqis includes Kurds incidentally 87%
of the population wants a concrete
timetable for withdrawal that was the
wording Tony Blair and George Bush
immediately announced that it would not
happen now we will has Bush put it at
the UN two days ago we will not abandon
you and your struggle to build a free
nation the population that we set a firm
timetable for withdrawal doesn't really
matter what 87% of the population want
that's another toothpick
of evidence demonstrating the visceral
hatred for a democracy the technical
name for it in western commentary it's
called democracy promotion or visions of
democracy and so on
there's a great deal of discussion going
on about withdrawal plans almost
invariably I have yet to find an
exception evading the main issue the US
for the United States for u.s. planners
a sovereign Iraq would be a complete
nightmare simply consider it's likely
policies a sovereign moderately
democratic Iraq as a Shiite majority the
first thing they would do the fact doing
it already is to improve relations with
Shiite Iran next door
majority the clerics that come from
there the one of the major militias in
the South was trained there then Iran
but they'd much prefer friendly
relations than hostility with their
major neighbor it's already happening
right across the border in Saudi Arabia
now there happens to be a Shiite
majority and as Iran has even tentative
moves toward sovereignty
it increases pressures there for some
kind of at least minimal human rights
are under vicious repression from the
us-backed tyranny but also some sort of
autonomy you can see what might develop
what might be I'm sure Washington
planners are having nightmares about it
what might develop is a loose Shiite
alliance
southern Iraq Iran neighboring areas of
Saudi Arabia and that happens to be
where Saudi most of Saudi oil is so that
alliance would control most of the
world's energy independent of Washington
unspeakable nightmare which could get a
lot worse
Europe is intimidated when the u.s.
shakes its fist and backs off China
isn't that's why China is considered
agree
you can't it's not a military threat but
it won't be intimidated I've been around
for 3,000 years no particular interest
in what the barbarians are saying so
they continue to invest including in
Saudi Arabia the prize I send military
aid every reason why they would like to
attract this alliance into their orbit
there are already major organizations
Shanghai Cooperation Council includes
South Central Asian states an agent
energy security grid based primarily in
China including Russia and neighboring
states they'll probably include India
before too long
if the Middle East oil resources move
into it the United States becomes a
second class power controlling the
world's energy resources has been a
prime policy objective for 60 years just
as it was for Britain before us and for
obvious reasons well that's not trivial
any withdrawal proposal that doesn't
take this into consideration it's just
not serious Pentagon can think of
withdrawal plans as easily as a weekend
in their spare time but what happens
afterwards well unless you think about
that you're not talking about withdrawal
let's talk about the fourth crisis
briefly Iran that's an extremely
dangerous one and there are possible
peaceful settlement three years ago in
May 2003 the Kotani government that's
the reformist moderate government but
with the support of the Ayatollah
Khamenei the supreme leader they offered
the United States negotiations on all
issues to state settlement of Israel
Palestine on nuclear issues and so on
the u.s. did respond and they responded
by reprimanding the Swiss diplomat who
brought the offer and that was the total
response and so it continues the right
afterwards
and the European Union entered into an
agreement of bargain the bargain was
that Iran would suspend its uranium
enrichment programs - it shifts entitled
under the non-proliferation treaty but
it would suspend them and in return the
European Union would provide what were
called firm guarantees on security
issues well everyone knows what security
issues means it means US and Israeli
threats credible threats not to attack
Iran now there's threats incidentally
are themselves a major violation of
international law which bars the threat
or use of force but again when an outlaw
state carries it out the educated
community accepts it as legitimate for
about two years
European Union back down on its side
apparently under US pressure after that
Iran back down also and returned to
enrichment the way it's described here
is Iran birthday agreement you know
return to uranium enrichment quite the
story
well the US has indicated under plenty
of pressure the willingness to negotiate
but on two conditions the first
condition is that the outcome of the
negotiations namely no uranium
enrichment is a precondition for
negotiations has to be fixed in advance
so first you fix the outcome then we
have negotiation second is that the
negotiations must proceed when I ran has
a gun to its head the u.s. refuses to
withdraw the threats of attack that
renders negotiations virtually
meaningless as I said the threats are in
violation of international law but
that's a minor detail and the threats
are very real they're not just words
last couple of years the United States
has sent to Israel over a hundred
advanced f-16s produced by our generous
benefactor in the next room the these
are publicly advertised as capable of
bombing Iran and returning Israel
already has air and armoured forces that
believe it or not or larger and
technologically more advanced than any
NATO power outside the United States but
this is a supplement aimed specifically
and publicly at Iran Germany has just
sent to Israel submarines equipped to
carry nuclear tipped missiles the
purpose of that is well known the
purpose is to strengthen Israel's second
strike capacity and those of you who
plays strategic analysis games know that
that means undermining any potential
Iranian deterrent to an attack these
actions and threats have to immediate
effects which are well understood the
first effect is to harm Iranian
reformers Democratic reformers who are
complaining bitterly about it the most
Abadi 2003 Nobel Prize laureate has
written that the threat of regime change
by military force reserved as an option
by some in the Western world polite in
reference to the United States that
threatened dangers nearly all the
efforts democracy mind that Iranians
have made in these recent years the
threat of military force gives the
system a pretext to crack down on its
legitimate opposition and undermines the
nascent civil society that is slowly
taking shape here it means Iranians
overlooked their resentment of the
regime and move behind their on
popular leaders out of defensive
nationalism I can think of no scenario
more alarming no internal shift more
dangerous than that engendered by the
West us imagining that it can bring
democracy to Iran through either
military might
or the fomentation of violent rebellion
and her position has been forcefully
reiterated by other leading there
rannian reformers and dissidents and the
reasons are clear the second consequence
of the u.s. stance is that the victors
efforts to reach a political settlement
which might will be possible well
opposition to an attack in Iran is even
greater than opposition to the Iraq war
where it instantly was overwhelming
worldwide the International Gallup polls
found practically no country where
support was greater than 10 percent
current polls reveal pretty surprisingly
that in the neighboring states Iran's
neighbors as turkey Saudi Arabia and
Pakistan if the public prefers a
nuclear-armed Iran to any US military
action and even in Europe which is the
part of the world that's most supportive
of Washington the u.s. is considered the
major threat to world peace ranking far
above Iran or any other country listed
in the polls which includes China Russia
and North Korea the US military presence
in Iraq is ranked as a greater threat
than Iranian nuclear weapons and the
israel-palestine conflict is ranked is
among the greatest threats to world
peace well in some sense all of this
awful news is actually good news the
reason is that we live in the state that
is regarded worldwide as a lawless and
Juris rogue state but we also have
incomparable freedoms and incomparable
legacy of freedom and of privilege and
that means that the power to end these
crimes and avert further ones that lies
in our hands
we won we have two microphones over here
please sign up and we'll take a pastor's
like where are the microphones what are
we getting
okay well if people would like to say
something once you come down to the mics
I'm just opening hi mr. Chomsky you give
us the impression that all of Israel's
neighbors are just looking for peace and
would be perfectly content to live side
by side with a Jewish state but isn't
the real cause of this conflict our
projection of a Jewish state entirely
and isn't that evidenced by the
following three brief facts that in 1948
the day after Israel declared its
independence five Arab armies declared
war on Israel for a long time after that
a common Arab saying was we will not
accept a Jewish state even if it is the
size of a postage stamp and in 2000
after the failures of Camp David
whoever's fault they were after failures
of negotiation instead of trying to
reach out more Arafat launched the
Second Intifada killing hundreds of
innocents rallies well let me repeat the
fact which is really the Palestinians
formally accepted a two-state settlement
decades ago the Arab states proposed it
at the United Nations in 1976 the Arab
League formally accepted not only a
two-state settlement but normalization
of relations with Israel that's accepted
by Iran it's accepted by Hezbollah Hamas
accepts it that's the situation for the
past thirty years our fight launched to
go through three points remind me if I'm
this one to say that Arafat launched the
Intifada is just propaganda
what didn't stop it there's no evidence
they'd launched it it's true that the
Intifada began after the collapse of
Camp David but you have to add to that
that the Camp David proposals the
us-israeli proposals were totally
unacceptable they were rejected by all
Arabs
by a boss America's favorite and Clinton
himself recognized that they were
totally unacceptable in fact a couple of
months later the shades broke down in
the summer a couple of months later a
Clinton announced his famous parameters
in December they were somewhat vague but
more forthcoming than the Impossible
Camp David proposals as Clinton
recognized or unacceptable those
parameters were the framework were
immediately after the Clinton announced
the parameters well just to quote
kittens alert words both sides accepted
the parameters both sides had
reservations they then met in Taba
Egypt to deal with the reservations with
the consequence I mentioned they came
very close to agreement it was called
off by Israel that's the situation the
first point and I think 48 by now
there's a huge literature on this to get
the first comment you made is that the
Arab states would not be content to live
with the Jewish state there that's
correct they certainly wouldn't be
content frankly I wouldn't be content
and as a Zionist youth leader in the
1940s I was part of the Zionist movement
that was strongly opposed to a Jewish
state just as we'd be opposed to a
Christian State they're an Islamic state
and so on aren't you railing about all
the Islamic states I do I mean very
bitterly a much harsher current really
because I don't hear a lot of that
because if you read the stuff that comes
out of the ad if you read what I write
you find it all the time fact I just
said it today
you heard me say it today I condemn the
brutal tyranny and
which valued us li the most extreme
fundamentalist state in the world yeah
and the rest of them - you didn't hear
it but it's there so yes they certainly
wouldn't be content with it nor should
any of us in my opinion but the North
Shore Israelis the state is designated
by the High Court the Supreme Court as
the state of the Jewish people in Israel
and the aspera not the state of its
citizens so it's your state and my state
but not the state of its citizens I
don't think we should accept that any
more than we should accept an Islamic
state or a Christian state in the United
States and it's not just symbolism I
won't go through the details but it's a
lot so certainly they wouldn't be
content with it but they've accepted as
for 1948 there's extensive literature on
it I won't go through it but Israeli
scholarship in the past several decades
has gone into this in great detail with
archival materials that were released
and so on if you want a good picture of
it one excellent book is Israeli
historian AVI flames book iron wall but
there are many others what happened was
of course neither side right after the
UN General Assembly recommendation in
November 47 a civil war broke out in May
1948 Israel did declare a state and yes
by that time it had already driven out
about 300,000 Palestinians and expanded
into the designated Palestinian state at
that point states of the Arab armies
entered but they were extremely weak the
only serious army was the Transjordan
Legion under British control which
basically kept out of the fighting and
their concerns were it appears primarily
to counter Britain this was
of anti-colonial uprising and they
regard they were concerned with tort
Transjordan and became Jordan which is a
British outpost and part of the reason
for their entry was apparently to
counter the ambitions of King Abdullah
of Jordan and the British behind him
they were British colonies virtually and
the fight that was fighting and it
wasn't a joke for about ten days it was
serious then check arms came in Eastern
European arms and the outcome to Israel
and the outcome was certain but the
first ten days were kind of touch-and-go
but the fighting took place almost
entirely in the designated Palestinian
state the outcome of the fighting was a
partition of the designated Palestinian
state between Jordan and Israel
virtually in half furthermore it was
largely by collusion again how these
name brought the major scholarly source
on this called collusion over Jordan and
the part of the half of the Palestinian
state that was incorporated into Israel
is now just called Israel nobody talks
about it the half that was administered
by Jordan is called the West Bank that's
what happened in 1948
as to the rest you know you can find
plenty of outrageous statements by
anyone you like on all sides and plenty
of actions but the fact is the crucial
fact is that clearly and explicitly at
1971 the major Arab military force by
far
Egypt offered a full peace treaty or
even through that and now we have 35
years of us Israeli rejection isn't okay
that's those are the core facts
three very brief points for your comment
first of all I was pleased to see that
Hugo Chavez apparently has some very
interesting reading tastes and I just
wondered if you had a sort of a personal
interlude if you had any response you'd
like to share to his comments yesterday
the UN secondly on your way and I tried
to hand you a flyer that I that I saw on
my way over here advertising a so-called
information session first the CIA
recruiting here at MIT and I just wonder
in it it's related to what we're talking
about tonight is it time for people to
begin challenging and what ways might it
be appropriate for people to be
challenging on campus recruiting by
entities like the CIA given their
evident involvement in torture etc and
thirdly in trying to do anything about
the things that you so carefully teach
us about one encounters the congressman
from this district Capuano voting along
with the overwhelming majority to
endorse the Israeli invasion
this past summer and the congressman Ed
Markey who's believed to be very good on
some other issues reacting with extreme
indignation when asked about Israel
saying but look at their the withdrawal
that they made you know I mean this sort
of trauma that the theater of trauma
that you mentioned he seemed to be a
strong advocate of that version of that
account of it I'm so given the obstacles
maybe you care to talk a little bit
about how we can overcome some of the
obstacles to making some change in US
policy look if this were Stalinist
Russia it
but it isn't it's a the most free
country in the world it really is we
have enormous privilege as well as
freedom so yeah there's things you can
do very much within the mainstream to
counter these you know these doctrines I
quoted the Boston Globe which is not
have a spokes you know spokesmen are
waving I call it for in fact the record
of the Democrats on this is by and large
worse than that of the Bush
administration but it's not beyond our
power to influence what congressional
representatives do I mean it's kind of
absurd take countries that really have
problems I mean we should be ashamed of
ourselves when we compare what's goes on
here with what goes on in the poorest
countries of the world let's a pic say
the poorest country of South America
Bolivia I mean they had an election last
December that we can't even dream of I
mean it was election an election where
the mass of the population participated
they didn't just show up an election Bay
they were carrying popular movements
carrying out struggles constantly over
major issues population knew what the
issues were they were serious ones they
came to an election they elected someone
for their own ranks
poor peasant now what do we do we had an
election shortly before that two
candidates both warn the wealth
political power and both went to the
same elite University join the same
secret society where you're trained to
be a member of the ruling class they
were able to run because they're
supported by pretty much the same
concentrations of economic power they
had pretty similar programs to the
extent you could even discover their
programs the party managers
careful to keep the issues out of sight
because population opposes both parties
on major issues and the election ended
up like bad on a level of you know
picking a lifestyle drug on the basis of
ads on television that's here where
there there's no terror there's no
repression there's no violence you know
get killed by the police and every
option is open
that's Bolivia it's a lot harsher these
are things that ought to be taught not
just in university political science and
departments but in eighth grade civics
classes and the same much of the world
pretty much same goes for the second
question about SIA the first one
actually about the CIA first of all it's
not a new issue this was a very live
issue in the early 1960s at MIT up to
the early 1960s the political science
department was publicly openly funded by
the CIA nobody was trying to conceal it
some other way I don't know how but it's
not public but right through the 60s
there were substantial protests about
the CIA and other military recruitment
on campus and in fact when off campus
went across the street if it's drifting
back on same point if you know I get
this plenty we can do about it and
there's plenty of presidents were first
I'd like to thank professor Chomsky for
his enlightening insights I have kind of
a couple of questions to you first one
is in the 40s 50s maybe 60 zionist cause
was perceived as some kind of
progressive i'm sorry i didn't i'm
saying in the in the nineteen forties
fifties and sixties in europe the
Zionist cause was perceived to be some
kind of a progressive cause and that's
one of the I mean at least perceived by
the European
and that's one of the main one of the
reasons why the West specially Europe
lent its support beyond Israel behind
Israel right now in Europe the
Palestinian cause is the progressive
cause in the sense or and saying
perceived by European left in the sense
of perceiving Palestinian cause as a
cause of national liberation is a kind
of fighting Israeli ethnic and racial
segregation I mean that are comparable
to the appetite model of South Africa
and also in the same token I mean
Palestinian struggle fighting against
the militarism fascist imperialist
expansions potential of Israel et cetera
et cetera unfortunately this is not the
case in United States where the American
left if there is an American left which
doesn't really consider that Palestinian
cause as a progressive cause my question
plain and simple when will this happen
and how it will it happen in the United
States that's my first question
yeah well just to look at the history a
little bit I mean it's unfortunate but
true that through the forties fifties
and sixties there wasn't a Palestinian
cause there should have been that there
wasn't and there's a reason for that
there had been a Palestinian revolt in
1936 2:39 popular revolt against the
British British colony and it was put
down violently by the British with you
know the Jewish community is no Israeli
Jewish settlement the issue of it was
called collec cooperated of course and
it was devastating to the Palestinian
society it was largely you know
semi-feudal mostly peasants urban
society wasn't organized for warfare
they struggled for it but they were
crushed and they were just didn't know
position to do much then came 48 they
couldn't deal with it you know they're
fighting a major army and crushed even
war most of them dispersed and in the
fifties and the sixties it was dispersed
community that's why in 1967 a major
document UN 242
mentions the Palestinians has a couple
of phrases about refugees that was the
Palestinian cause in the seventies it
changed that's why the change took place
that you described by the 1970s the
Palestinian issue did enter the
international agenda that's why you had
the 1976 resolution vetoed by the US and
a whole pile of others and it isn't just
the European left its most of the world
it's not it's not the American left
that's not part of it it's the United
States that's not part of it the United
States has almost unilaterally barred
this it's and it's what kind of reasons
for it i interpretation is written about
is that what happened in 1960 the u.s.
didn't have a close relationship with
israel until 1967 1967 is the year in
which the us-israel relationship really
firmed though and there was a reason in
1960 said there was a struggle going on
in the arab world between the radical
fundamentalist camp of which saudi
arabia is the main part and a secular
nationalist arab movement which Nasser
was the main part in fact Saudi Arabia
need Nasser of Egypt Saudi Arabia and
Egypt were affected fighting a proxy war
at that point in the end well the u.s.
was lined up with Islamic
fundamentalists as it's been throughout
most of the second you know most of the
this whole period since the second world
war it's been lined up with radical
Islamic fundamentalists against secular
nationalism
that's nominee Saudi Arabia it's also
the origins of Hamas I'm in Israel which
agrees with us on this I was supporting
radical Islamic fundamentalists in the
occupied territories against
the secular PLO and as well that comes
from the same root and you know we all
know about the roots of al-qaeda and the
rest radical fundamentalist organized by
the Reagan administration for their own
political ends so the u.s. have been
overwhelmingly on the radical
fundamentalist side in 1967 Israel
performed a huge service to the US Saudi
Arabia the energy corporations it
destroyed the center of the secular Arab
nationalism which was posing a threat
it was posing the threat of using the
energy resources of the region for its
own population not just to for the
benefit of Western corporations and so
on but not just and you know with some
side part of its going into the pockets
of the rich rulers well that was a
threat and once Israel eliminated that
threat it became a strong ally of the
u.s. in 1970 that continued in 1970
Jordan u.s. British Black September it
looked briefly as if Syria might
intervene to stop the slaughter the u.s.
didn't want that but it was totally
bogged down into China couldn't do a
thing and Israel performed another
service it mobilized the army in the air
force to deter potential Syrian
intervention to protect the Palestinians
which is regarded as a threat to be oil
monarchies well that year and you know
it's at that point that Israel
established itself as what's called a
strategic asset it was part of the
system by which the u.s. controls the
tries to control the region successfully
for many years well you know when US
policy shifted to support for
the intellectual community almost
reflexively joins it's not just on this
but on anything I mean that's talked
about other topics you find pretty much
the same thing
so that was one factor another factor
was that there were domestic issues
remember this was in the middle of the
Vietnam War the US was failing to crush
Vietnamese resistance people later told
a different story but if you go back to
that time which remember very well you
can certainly read about it at that time
the liberal Americans were supporting
the war I mean there may be complaining
because it's cost them too much or
something but their support of the war
in fact they really never offered any
principled objection to the war just
that it's costing too much but not the
population but the intellectual
community well they were pretty upset
that the United States was unable to
crush it
Johnson called Israel came along and
showed how you treat third-world people
properly you kick them in the face they
want a lot of points for that from
liberal humanists who are supposed to
posture about being in favor of peace
and love and so on but really watching
Rambo movies in their spare time that's
kind of the psychology and there were
other things happening inside the United
States
that's students were not following
orders
there was eating sculpture the women's
movement was beginning places blown up
the centers of authority are being
challenged well again it was a symbol of
how you take care of them and they won
plenty of points there were other things
but those are major factors it was
pretty much the same urine
I wouldn't exaggerate there's some
difference but
our Europe is a little more dissociated
from direct involvement in the u.s.
policies in the Middle East they kind of
tacitly support them but they're not
directly involved to some extent they
are like written with spine arms to
Israel during the current war that
Germany as I mentioned is providing
Israel with submarines that can take
nuclear-armed missiles which eliminate
an Iranian to turn right now there's a
couple days ago Germany announced that
we'll be patrolling the Lebanese coast
it's not going to control the Israeli
coast and that's where the invasions are
coming from Europe goes along with
European opinion pretty much goes along
with the United States on this it's true
that the discussion isn't as constrained
in Europe there's critics you know find
some critical voices and there's
political organizations in Europe as you
say what you're different but the
differences aren't massive and I think
they're largely explained by the
directness of the involvement in the
actions for the same strong Iraq and
other issues
I'm take say the invasion of Iran on a
Europe is overwhelmingly opposed this is
the US military's as intelligence or
leads but a lot of the population is
terrified that Iran is going to come and
get us it was the same in Iraq I mean
even today we take a look at polls I
think I forget the latest numbers but I
think around half the population that
thinks that Saddam had something to do
with 9/11 or the time that Saddam had
weapons of mass destruction they're
coming after us I mean I get letter so
I'll get them tonight you know saying
how can you support as if I do how can
you support Cuba Venezuela
and when they're just about to strangle
us and destroy us I mean if you look at
this from the outside you know laughter
when you look at the actual history
apart from the disparity of force but
there are plenty of people who believe
it and in fact that good that's a deep
there's something really significant
here about American cultural history
when it was far away the most powerful
country in the world hasn't been under
any threat since 1812 1814 but
nevertheless there's a strain of fear in
American popular culture that goes way
back there's some good studies of it
studies of a very good book by Bruce
Franklin called the war stars which is
literary critics which is a study of
popular literature you know the kind of
things that people like Harry Truman
were reading when they grew up the and
there's a strain in popular literature
which now shows up in television and
movies but it used to be many magazines
and books and so on which the strain is
that the u.s. is being attacked by a
overwhelmingly powerful force which is
just about the destroyers and when at
the last minute you know a super hero or
a super weapon or a bunch of high-school
students and the hills or herded
suddenly rescue us from this demon and
if you look at the demon it's usually
somebody were crushing so originally the
demon was the indigenous population then
it was the blacks in the late 19th
century it was the Chinese you know the
time you think that they're Chinese
laundryman but that's not what they are
they're these
millions of Chinese you know seeping
into the United States to take us over
and destroy us
in fact jackal London who's a
progressive writer a story I think the
early 20th century in which he literally
called for destruction of the population
of China by bacteriological warfare to
defend ourselves against those Chinese
longer you know and this strain goes
right to the present I'm sure people
your age have seen it on television in
the movies the what the psychology is
it's complicated affair but it has
something to do with overwhelming power
I think I mean if you're crushing people
you have to have a justification for it
and there aren't many justifications
that one justification is well they're
evil and they deserve another
justification is we're doing it for the
self-defense that's pretty common now
you go back to say Germany in the 30s
there remember Germany was the most it
was the peak of Western civilization it
was the peak of the arts and the
sciences that's where he went to study
physics and so on
within a couple of years it was turned
into a society of raving lunatics
nothing like it in history and a lot of
it was playing fear other Jews are going
to destroy us they're trying to destroy
the Aryan race not just us but the Aryan
race we have to defend ourselves
unfortunately you find a lot of things
like this in history and in American
culture goes way back and it's prevalent
today that's something to do
shorter answers okay my other question
is quite brutal than them and it's like
I'm trying to address here dr. Chomsky
the leftist anarchists Tom think I would
say like after a whole century of
failure over the left I mean progressive
laughing establishing a sojourner to
return it to the capital status quo I
mean the catastrophic failure of state
socialism state capitals and state
welfarism anarcho-syndicalism all sorts
of leftist alternative to the capital
status quo now we're back to the old
Leninist question what's to be done I
mean we have a lot of moral rage out
there we are against I don't know
corporate capitalism the organic
Consumers culture we organized
imperialist expansion steps are etc but
how can we translate this more rage into
constructive political capital
constructive political action and how
can this be possible
in a society which is very only
dimensional in creating its own
opposition making its opposition think
in the same way as the mainstream I mean
I would say in our society even
opposition is thinking in corporatist
terms I mean the corporatist consumerist
worldview framework is still shaping the
mindset of the opposition I can't how
can we think creatively about this how
can we have this politics of it's pretty
simple I mean the the major attack on
socialism in the 20th century in my
opinion was the Bolshevik coup that
destroyed the socialist movements of
Russia which were significant I mean it
destroyed the fort one of the first
things that Lenin and Trotsky did was to
destroy the workers councils the Soviets
eliminate the Constituent Assembly in
fact any democratic and socialist an
institution that had developed and for a
principle reason I mean they were
orthodox Marxist they saw
a backward peasant society candy which
was true you can't have a revolution
there you have to drive it by force to
industrialization and the iron laws of
history come along and so on but that
was a major attack on socialism in fact
I think that when they were one of the
main barriers to socialism throughout
the 20th century when the Berlin Wall
fell there was a symposium in the nation
where people were supposed to talk about
it and if you look at the Articles they
were all surprised me I mean Social
Democrats who had been opposed to the
Russians for years
wailed about the collapse of socialism I
see I had an article and I said it's a
small victory for socialism kind of like
the elimination of fascism it overcomes
some of the barriers I don't think
anybody understood what it's talking
about but yeah that's what I think it
was there have been plenty of victories
I mean we live in a much more free
society with far more rights than a
century ago but then thirty years ago
for that matter in many ways the
activism of the 60s that caused a real
major transformation of American society
now let's just take MIT you know I've
been here for 50 over 50 years if you
walk down the halls of MIT in the early
60s
what you saw was well-dressed white
males differential Hawaii and so on take
a walk down the halls today it's not
what you see those that's and that's
everywhere in the country and it
reflects big changes well they didn't
come about by people saying what can we
do you know they came about by people
doing it
it's true that there are barriers but
you know they a huge PR industry that
tries to drive people to consumerism is
nothing like torture chambers and secret
police yeah it's a barrier but a lot
easier to deal with and I don't even
thinking and in fact if you count the
number of people today young people in
particular involved in one or another
form of activism I think it's probably
larger than the sixties
okay this meeting is a perfect example
but the first meeting at MIT on the
Palestinian issues I remembered very
well
spoke was in 1969 and you know you could
barely get out alive if you talked about
things like this and breakthrough is
into the nineteen nineties it was police
protection at meetings at MIT if the
Palestinian topics came up that's
changed you know even in the last few
years because a lot of people are doing
something about it
so there's no need for I don't I don't
think there ever were complicated
answers in the past ever good much the
answers we have ever been understood or
pretty simple ones and we can proceed to
implement them it's more a failure of
will than the opportunity I think
sorry I didn't see any somebody over
there how grateful we are - I've heard
you speak I was wondering if I could ask
questions one what about the the
two-state solution that you were talking
about so that the solution for Palestine
Israel and don't you think even if a
two-state solution were to be achieved
it would be a defeat for for radicals
you know as far as I remember it has
always been talk about having a one
state solution and why aren't we talking
about that anymore and you know can we
go back to notions of secular socialist
Middle East again and can we go back to
well actually if you were really
listening carefully I threw in a phrase
there which required another talk but
I'm saying that a two-state solution
might open the doors to better outcomes
for all the people of the region that's
exactly what I had in mind yeah it's
fine that I don't think a one state
solution makes any sense for most
societies in the nation-state there's a
kind of a European invention which was
imposed by violence
that's why Europe was the most violent
savage area of the world for centuries
trying to establish these borders and
most of the horrible wars going on
around the world today our residues of
the colonial system which tried to
impose similar systems everywhere as
India Pakistan Africa in fact is
repellent almost everywhere so it's a
rotten system but the and the reason it
doesn't you know it's so savage is it
just doesn't deal with the complexities
of societies it sort of forces them all
into a mold
that people are not people are like that
have all kind of interests and concerns
the and the levant the eastern
Mediterranean region is particularly
that's particularly true there it's a
very complex mosaic of different
societies ethnic groups and religious
groups class conflicts all sorts of
things and imposing state boundaries
there as the colonial powers did it's
bound to leave a residue of violence and
conflict so I don't think the right
long-term goal is a one-state solution
it sort of works in the United States
but there's a reason for that the
complexity and variety of this society
was essentially wiped out by
extermination so yeah if you wipe out
the indigenous societies and you know
you bring in a lot of anglo-saxon we're
called anglo-saxon they aren't of course
immigrants and then yeah you got a
fairly homogeneous society but so yes
you can have one state but doesn't work
in most of the world in fact European
societies are sensibly moving slowly
towards more autonomy and more
regionalism revival of local cultures
and so on which are kind of a
multi-national society is not
necessarily national there's other
groups too so I think the right answer
the right answer in former Palestine is
at least divided by national state and
then to you know state you know like
integrating the whole region more fully
but has to come in stages people who are
calling for a one state settlement in my
view are really performing a service for
the far right and there's a reason for
that there's just no you know you have
to make a distinction between proposing
something actually advocating it okay
like we can propose that everybody
should live in peace and love okay I
propose doesn't mean anything
and it's the same when you propose a
one-state settlement how do you get
there
well the only advocacy I have ever heard
is through stages of which today two
stage settlements the first people who
say no let's just have a one state
settlement they're giving a gift to be
over right they say well if that's the
only alternative we have to defend
ourselves because there's no support for
it I'm the number of people in Israel
who you can support it you could put in
a telephone booth so it's just saying
well okay we have to defend ourselves
from people after trying to destroy us
but you could get to it in stages now
there was a period and what you're
referring to when I was calling for a
move towards the federal solution and a
bi-national state but those are
different circumstances advocacy depends
on circumstances between 1967 and mid
seventies there was an opportunity for a
federal solution in the former Palestine
Palestinians would have accepted it I
think the Israelis would have accepted
it there were proposals I briefly
mentioned them even from Israeli
intelligence not calling for that but
calling for steps that might lead to
that so that was a possible step
feasible step and that could lead to by
nationalism it could lead the lessening
tension as an en go on from there
however it was strongly opposed by all
sides bitterly opposed by all sides had
been gen anywhere and after the 73 war
the opportunity was lost and by the time
the Palestinian national issue was had
been formulated by Palestinians and on
the international agenda I just don't
see any first step other than a
two-state settlement so if you say and
this is generalizes if you want to
advocate something whatever it is
nuclear disarmament
our mental issues whatever advocacy
requires paying attention to existing
circumstances and asking what can we do
next you know yeah you can have
long-term visions which maybe guide your
decisions but you can't just propose the
long-term solutions that quickly um just
very briefly you mentioned about other
possibilities they're open to us and
they do exist but you know I imagine
that you write your view of the status
like the most important thing a civil
society and this is like so control the
state might not necessarily change the
important things this long-term the the
moats and all the networks that that
makes civil society open well like I was
just wondering that in our civil society
I mean like just in our classes at
Harvard well like all that we're
learning is how to be good
administrators and how to be good like
in the class study about the American
presidency you've learned that you know
like America is really divided among
parties and there is no agreement and
the media is critical I mean I learned
this today and it's just completely
ridiculous
and you think why don't we do right away
to deal with factionalism and conflicts
and so on right and they're like well
you know no one will ever agree on
anything
there's no my wife is a complicated
affair of people have lots of interests
and you try to do with families are hard
to do so if we're learning things like
this well so if we're learning sort of
nonsense like this and kind of
institutions that we're going to if
we're learning these things if they're
telling us that my question is how do we
penetrate how do we change civil society
not the government 40 years how did it
change from a student body of
differential well-dressed white males
for the average income
but what is the average income among
high and it came from people of your age
trying to do something about it but but
the idea like for instance could you
tell us a class that we could take just
just at Harvard which is critical which
is taught by a socialist professor which
is challenging our social norms there
isn't one look I couldn't find me one
Isaac if you want a magic key you're not
going to find it the only way to do it
is educational efforts
consciousness-raising
willing to teach a class that challenges
society there's not a single one there
you're asking for a formula that's gonna
fit all cases and there has never been
one and there will never be one there we
have there's a history of significant
progress let me take say the global
justice movements that are ludicrous Lee
called anti-globalization those are huge
popular movements all over the world
here too
it wasn't even a seed of them ten years
ago they've accomplished plenty I mean
there are now you know there's an
international agenda widely supported
plenty of the involvement confronting
the neoliberal orthodoxy isn't changing
him where do you think the Bolivian and
the movement came from or the mistakes
take a look at South America I mean the
government's that the United States now
regards as allies are the kind of
governments who have been trying to
overthrow 30 or 40 years ago because the
continent has just shifted significantly
towards a bit of some integration social
progress development independence
there's a rise of indigenous movements
for the first time these are all major
changes and it's the world Social Forum
meets in the South for a good reason
that's where the major centers of
activism and popular movements have been
but the North is involved visit Boston
Social Forum which is a kind of an
umbrella group for lots of activism
working on issues relevant here and
these things if you want to magic key
there's never been one in the past they
won't ever be one of the future it's any
more than any other kind of
interpersonal relations
I mean suppose you have problems in your
family there's no formula that says how
you deal with them you deal with them in
terms of the sympathetic understanding
of the actual situation and an effort to
make progress thank you very much
professor Chomsky and thank
