a bank downtown to see if he could
extract a couple of dollars from a
failed bank account being able to do my
extended family was first-generation
immigrants working class mostly
unemployed politically active than the
left organizations the striking
objectively speaking the situation was
much worse than it's today that's a far
richer country than it was but the
general attitude was quite different
there was an attitude of hopefulness
looking forward but we're somehow gonna
get out of this working together a lot
of it was the Union movie so for example
I had to make naturally very close they
came to visit all the time
seamstresses unemployed but they were
members of the International ladies
garment workers which provided a light
for my cultural activities community
even a week in the Catskills it was a it
was a life a vibrant exciting life well
many of the people were formerly
uneducated and one of the biggest
incidences my own boys would say an
uncle who had never gotten beyond fourth
grade work it was disabled so it was a
be the good news stand under it was
probably the most educated person I've
ever met in my life
excited interested in all sorts of
things lively work of education program
the people are discussing today the
latest performance of the beautiful
swing
this is dead
the Shakespeare play day so I think and
in general the sense that somehow it's
going to work we're doing things we can
get together that would really made a
difference was when the labor movement
started to be constituted I hate to say
this to you because you know hundred
times better than I do but in the 1920s
the labor movement in virtually crushed
all the Wilson Red Scare was the final
blow if the years of violent state
repression of them had been very so in
the 20s it was almost born in the early
theories have started to revive all
sorts of ways I mean some of my earliest
memories are writing in a trolley car I
was in Philadelphia with my mother
passing man textile mill we're women
workers we Adams the picketing my
security officers were eating them up
outside I was a little bit but
nevertheless we're doing something the
strikes strike weights CIA organizing
again strike ladies again taking note
they started becoming militant militant
doesn't mean Clayton it means changing
things but when it got to the level of
sit-down strikes you could see that
these owners that the bosses were really
getting worried I'm gonna sit down
strike this one step before saying we
don't need you guys
we'll take over and run the factory
ourselves that's the end back to the
system is controlled really very fragile
that relies on submission if submission
was gone you're in trouble it's an
insight goes back as far as David Hume
power is in the hands of the ghost if
they
xiety takes it so the control relies on
consent because throwing the consent for
support as you've pointed out
effectively it does depend on having a
relative in sympathetic administration
it's not going to come in and crush
everything the violence does depend and
there was that in the thirties the
Brazil administration was at least
sympathetic sometimes even safe coming
so you had this combination I remember
my parents sort of leftish Democrats my
mother especially sitting Friday night
tuned to the radio for Roosevelt's
fireside right now I'm just feeling okay
the world see we've got somebody's gonna
say this
well that's along with the labor
millions what was provided by the labor
movement interesting personal life left
an atmosphere of expectation that we're
doing something it's pretty rough we can
go ahead have a life hopelessness it was
spared so just take the Sanders campus
which was a remarkable success in many
ways it shifted entire arena of debate
and especially well to the life of a
Democratic Party
formal program couldn't imagine as far
back as the media representatives came
in Sanders broke was over a century of
American political history by showing
you can become a viable candidate
without relying on corporate sector
private wealth well this is an amazing
success the sanest that have been
winning the primary
young people especially to sell into
deep depression there was nothing like
that anything for the 40s or the 50s
over six certainly not the 60 shows
everybody setbacks but then you go on
then you make progress this regression
but you pick up where you learn and this
is a perfect time for that it's easier
to do it now than it's been for this far
back but somehow there's a sense you
can't do anything you can't fight city
hall if they're strong this is very
frankly I think it's the effective 40
years of neoliberal propaganda and
strangulation which is just left
I mean initiators of the new liberal
progressive basically wealthy in the
corporate sector understood very well
the role of Labor in in carrying the
progress 40 so their first moves Reagan
and Thatcher two main figures was to
smash the labor brigand bringing in
scabs unforgivable apartheid South
Africa soon picked up by the court
rejected that stature trying to smash
the miners digging the ideology is
there's no society everybody's cast on
the market alone organizations have to
be destroyed everything has to be
atomized the Reagan starting in was a
racist attack on this welfare queens
business which trained large segment of
the population to believe that any form
of government action is taking our tax
money very hard with him now we work
hard pay taxes and then give it away to
who's undeserving people you get that
or than a bunch of the Southwest
identification on all of this is deep
the Democrats champion Clinton made it
worse they picked it up come round with
it exactly in the world Sanders is the
first real break when it's successful
but somehow that's led to it's all led
to the sense of depression that you can
see it in Europe as well where there's a
lot of Rage resentment to some positive
constructive activity that's kind of
almost overwhelming the general sense of
I think sort of is like steroids it's a
shocking thing but it can be
reconstituted this is the way it was in
the thirties so one core Illinois I'm
sure it's gonna have to be revived out
of the vapor they've been losing now
we're seeing in interesting ways
so began with the teacher strikes which
are very interesting
they're in places like where I live
Arizona West Virginia labor organization
a lot of reaction it may be teachers of
I'm in Arizona it has the lowest
spending per capita in education after a
Mississippi way down at the bottom
teachers are very poorly paid the
teachers strike again it's a tremendous
book exploit their slogan is invested
you see signs were all over the place
and interested leaders for the strikes
went to the state legislature of the
demonstrations they were partly calling
for an improvement in the miserable
wages but the important point is that
they were calling for it exactly what
the slogan says invest in education
let's
conditions under which our children can
have a favorable educational environment
decent classes facilities so on
there's even community efforts right
here in poor communities that's at a
time I could go into them which has
created some really marvelous things in
very poor working-class mostly makes it
convenient it seems like that are
happening so there's all sorts of
there's a lot of positive village but
not actually see that Minister the
corrected corona virus crisis their
communities poor community organizing
self organize let's figure out a way to
get food to this elderly disabled person
he's gonna run people helping each other
coming together that's and of course
this is amazing model of the nurses and
doctors working heroically under awful
conditions when posed on them by really
malevolent but nevertheless putting it
aside working in dangerous conditions
then I front lines these are real models
of what can be done all around raising
fees lots of sense of opportunity that
can be grasped that's happened in the
30s we've just changed the country
changes enormous the effect lasted
essentially up to baby you know there's
so many ways we could go with your
answer there but I think that you know
to build on a couple of your points the
1920s as you point out was terrible for
labor unions decimated and that's pretty
similar to today you know since the
1980s the union movement has shrunk
worker power has lessened
and we today see unions at their weakest
point since the 1920s but as you also
point out the 1930s or a period of hope
and I agree with you that there is a
sense oftentimes of hopelessness I see
this sometimes with my students I see
this with as you point out the responses
to the Sanders campaign that it is a
huge victory in many many ways and yet
there is this feeling of what do we do
now and I agree with you that this is
part of that neoliberal shift and this
kind of individualism that has stopped
in some ways bringing us together but we
are seeing today also a huge amount of
people coming together supporting each
other in the ways that you describe now
one difference between 1933 and 2020 is
that you remember your parents listening
to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and today
we have Donald Trump tweeting so to what
you know so I guess how do we as people
desperate to make a better life for
ourselves and our family and our nation
how do we approach this political
question in 2020
well the first point which is essential
and to my mind so trivial but I don't
understand why I wasn't talking about it
is to get rid of the malignancy in the
White House which is unbelievable I
don't think it has a counterpart in
political history of the plenty of
terrible things but at least the
presidents were half human you know you
could imagine the pressure
and I was even done like you know Nixon
and Reagan no words but they were
susceptible to public pressure there's
very good examples of that I don't think
that's true from this is a sociopathic
buffoon who is interested in only one
thing in the world himself which means
as he understands placating his primary
constituency which is wealth
extreme wealth and corporate power knows
if you pour money into their pockets
that let you get away with your Anders
even so they don't like them but he
understands when the rest you have to
give him credit for it he's probably the
most effective con man ever to have
appeared in political history and he
makes PT Barnum looked like a total
amateur the guy who was selling me the
Brooklyn Bridge somehow he's managing to
hold up a banner in one hand the same I
love you I'm the Savior I'm the one
person who's gonna rescue from you from
disaster the other hand is stabbing in
the back with every single legislative
action that's quite an achievement and
want to go back to childhood memories so
my childhood memories or listening to
the radio to the nurnberg relish
understand the words moving we make sure
the crowd and the screaming support this
angry mob that he couldn't miss even as
a six-year-old kid and in fact the first
article in 1939 was about the seemingly
inexorable spread of fascism over Europe
Nazi stupid
Austria Avakian I was writing right
after the fall of course and I meant to
go to Spain seemed like this never mind
when I did I don't want to compare it
ladies from that's uncertain ideology
not just me me me anything I'll kill
anybody around as long as it helps me
move sometimes the Scimitar so right now
for example when armed crowd surrounded
legislatures is their corporate sponsors
fighting funding them on Trump is
telling them you know go ahead and
adding don't forget your second
Amendment rights totally irrelevant to
the issue pushing the book that's a good
con man goes get your guns and defendant
it does resonate differently many ways
so there's several things you remember
and it's worth bearing in mind that in
the 1920s
Germany was the most civilized part of
the Western world it was the center of
the arts sciences literature that was
regarded why did you see model for
democracy ten years later is the so
there's a lot to be medicine physics
signs of that today in my lifetime this
is about the first time
since the thirties the young people even
knew what Maydays is I mean one of the
geniuses of American propaganda has been
to absolutely wipe out the history of
American labor Stricker's I made a is an
international day of support for
American workers struggles celebrated
everywhere in the world here nobody
knows what it is it's law day I remember
I've been and I remember being in Europe
shortly after the fall of Franklin was
in Spain in May on May Day I had to
decide which of two huge demonstrations
of the CNT the anarchists labor movement
which of the two demonstration of the
American slavery because of dead I made
okay that's a couple of years after
Franco here it's been wiped out of
memory there's a thing called Labor Day
which is the day when you celebrate
coming back to work that's that's really
an amazing propaganda but it's being
overcome people are learning about it
today there are strikes all over the
place someone really important take the
Amazon workers I mean they're about the
most miserably treated worker as you can
imagine and it's not their first strike
couple years in a couple of months ago
that's a bit exactly one year ago there
was a major strike through by Amazon
Workers which doesn't affect well just
B's us there was bad world shifted
position on climate change
he said yeah he's gonna give doesn't
kind of like ten million dollars or
something had he changed me to work on
climate on ending this on a turn
into company I wouldn't have happened
otherwise even not only governments but
corporations are susceptible in rising
popular activism as you could see it
very strikingly one of the most
important meetings that takes place
every year Davos Switzerland
every January they call themselves the
Masters of the Universe they get
together schemes of parties tell each
other I wonder who they are
John said you CEOs of major corporations
media magnate like that kind of touched
this year was different it was very
interestingly different it was a maybe
the mood was what we've got to tell the
public that we made bad mistakes the
neoliberal programs really did hurt them
we were looking after their own profits
that was bad we recognized that there
now changing remember this declaration
of the couple hundred CEOs he said yeah
we realized we were bad guys no it's
gonna be really good people humans we're
gonna work for you you can trust us put
your face in our hands because he's
changed
actually I'm old enough to remember in
earlier parties they call in the
nineteen fifties the idea was what was
called social corporations the
corporations are not just out for profit
and market share and their souls they
really care about the important things
in the world
so let's trust that actually 60 years to
see go sold now the moon is coming back
and not just because of their goodness
of their hearts the feeling the pressure
we'll see the presents in the pits were
famous you're right and they know they
better do something about it I think
there was a the meetings in Davis open
with the most fantastic 10 or 15 minutes
I've ever seen in my life
it should just be shown over and over
everywhere his classroom isn't public
meeting and the Davis meetings opened
with two keynote addresses the first one
of course is Donald Trump you know the
master of the world but they don't like
him
this is vulgarity is pretentiousness
they don't like it at all that's the one
thing they didn't see interferes with
their image solsa message but they
applauded him after a crazy rant about
hopeful everything's wrong but they all
applauded expanding the clothes why
because he understands something that
they understand what's important what
doesn't matter what the antics are
what's important is to remember that you
funnel the wealth of the world into the
right pockets he understands that they
understand it so the rest of it you can
put aside okay after this comical
tragedy of a couple of minutes came the
next speaker beretta Thunder young girl
actually actually very straightforward
funding what for saying you are
betraying us you in the audience up
there
monk it was polite applause but the
general feeling was your nice little
girl go back to school and let us take
care of the series think you were very
striking tells you a lot about the
modern world right there in Fat City
and it's not just Greta Thunder it's all
these kids who went out on the climate
strip it's a major event last October
buzz extension same series and others
all over the place the sunrise move a
bunch of young kids we're working on
trying to stop destruction of the
environment that went as far as
occupying the offices and Congress got
support from young legislators who came
in on the Sanders way the Alexandria
because he of Cortes made me Ed Markey
senator from Massachusetts has been
concerned about and we're about issues
joined in other they managed to get to
some kind of green new deal for a Grimm
on the legislative agenda it's a
tremendous achievement we need something
like that to survive some former other
some kind of green new deal type program
national program a couple of years ago
was if it was mentioned the rule was
really clear now it's in the center of
attention that's another amazing
achievement of the activism over the
last couple of years the kind of thing
that can be done it's kind of pathetic
that it's the young people in the world
who were in the forefront not our
generation which should be she's right
when she said Greta Thonburi you
betrayed us we should be doing well the
burden should not be on young people
saddled this
minced it no jobs so on but they're the
ones doing it now I think maybe today
will see a revived labor movement
joining this thing that could make a
huge difference all the young kids who
feel depressed shouldn't they should be
seen we've got a great opportunity now
we're way better off than people in the
past who struggled against myths were
shot and we're not Freedom Riders riding
through Alabama yeah but try to get a
black farmer to be willing to face the
lynch mobs and vote I'm getting shot and
killed himself it's not that young
people did it they were in the forefront
of the superbeing Civil Rights me he'd
have been the first one to tell you it
was the sink workers on the ground the
black students who were sitting in on
lunch counters of his life who poured
you the way the writing the way that's
what's happening now in free revive
labor movement could make a huge
difference and I think we're at a moment
the Piranha died of growing the virus
has sort of created a situation of sharp
class conflict but I haven't seen for a
long time the guys who owned and run the
world
they don't stop they're relentless they
go on all the time right now they were
working very hard to try to ensure that
what comes out of this crisis will be a
harsher form of the neoliberal plate
they're spending all go through the
details with you doing question is
what's everyone else going to do are
they gonna let this happen
or are they going to use the power
that's in the hands of the government to
change things when a lot is happening
not just domestically internationally as
well of course
Lizzy you're not going to read about it
in the newspaper
but on about a week from now I think may
11th will be the first international
meeting of a progressive international
it was initiated by Bernie Sanders in
the United States and Dennis Farah
focusing your very important
economists and political activists he
founded the the m25 New York white
movement it's worth imagine throughout
the continent to try to salvage whatever
is of any value in the European Union
things that will save them and get rid
of the rock which is corrupting
destroying oh so they're getting
together to form the converse of
international which is a conscious
effort and accurate effort to counter
something that's being organized in
Washington you don't read about it in
the press but out of a sort of chaos of
the Trump White House you can detect
some geo strategic thinking the one of
them is to form an international
alliance of the most reactionary
oppressive states in the world run by
the white house then the Western
Hemisphere is include people like both
Shannara and resilience right-wing thug
who's destroying the jelly's Mali's from
the Middle East to keep like the NBS
killer who's known in Saudi Arabia
dictatorship United Arab Emirates
another brutal family dictatorship CC's
Egypt the worst potato chip in Egypt's
history Trump says it's best friend
Israel's so far to the right we can't
even see it anymore
he's now openly joining with fantastic
relations in the past India under Modi
is trying to
stole great wing in new machinist state
which will wipe out Indian secular
democracy you Europe to get to Borbon
turning Hungary into dictatorship the
right wing elements of Italy like Sofia
who want to murder their recipes
slinging miseries from Africa let them
drown at sea so so put all that together
you get a powerful reactionary
internationally the Progressive
International is an effort to counter
very much like the conflict here
magnified to an international arena
these are things that are going on all
over the world ones one another and what
comes out of it and make a huge
difference
the coronaviruses focusing attention on
these possibilities we are going to be
entering a different world and the
question is which one will it be
there are contending forces we can take
a stand what - thank you for that I want
to combine we have some great questions
from the audience and I want to build on
those and ask you a couple of questions
so Gloria notes quote divide and conquer
has been used successfully for centuries
how could we best fight against divide
and conquer and it that question reminds
me of things that you have been saying
about you know your past and the history
of American labor and you know and and
Trump in that in the 1930s the forefront
of the American labor movement was
largely immigrant it war or immigrants
sure it was Jewish it was polish it was
Italian
you know these alone and
african-american and in the southwest
mexican-american which was very
important no there were sharp
racist divisions I can't remember
from childhood in Philadelphia where I
lived it was the only Jewish family and
a Irish German neighborhood it was
pretty late I went to Hebrew school
which I take the subway
but to get from the subway to the Hebrew
school we had to have police protection
literally when you got back on the
subway around your effect was so serious
that in the city at one point imposed a
7 p.m. turf curfew on teenagers to try
to keep down race conference at the same
time than the labor movement they were
working together
the racial conflicts were overcome soon
as you started organizing the CIO and
carrying out military same thing that
happened is a better night than the
1890s as end the racism against the Huns
and anybody from Eastern Europe the
Irish were treated like dogs but as the
labor movement began to develop and
western Pennsylvania and elsewhere he's
been very strong this was going they
work together
had common goals and aims and I think
that's today well and and many of these
workers today who are leading the
resistance are people working for Amazon
working in these meatpacking plants
getting sick from coronavirus and who
are they they are african-american
they are Mexican they are Guatemalan
they are Somali and so you know in in
terms of Gloria's question about divide
and conquer like today alike in the past
we have a very diverse workforce Donald
Trump comes to power in part by by
breaking apart a sense of solidarity
between workers of different races so
how do we overcome this divide and
conquer world that has made class
solidarity
difficult no he's not the only one
let's go back to Reagan there was no
anything not my favorite person but
nowhere near as malevolent is the White
House malignancy but where did he start
his 1980 campaign he picked a town in
Mississippi pining small town which was
known for only one thing the murder of
civil rights workers and of course the
Republican Party's that oh that was just
an accident
his first speeches began with the
welfare of Queens
these black studs are coming to the
welfare office and there are limousines
I think because they're 15 children to
do the stealing you will see tonight
show you know what he was doing
you have to it's very important if
you're gonna stab people in the back to
get them to turn to something else like
hating the INEX to me
the Trump understands that too he's not
an idiot operated so yes let's try to
get people to hate each other
now what's the wall about I mean putting
like look at his latest budget which is
interesting to look at more money for
the wall everything is in the wall but
because they are coming after us
you know who was they miserable people
flee from the fact from the destruction
that we caused in their countries right
up to the present a couple of years ago
the main flood of refugees is from
Honduras where there was a military coup
that overthrew a mafia for miss
Covington Obama and Clinton were the
only ones in the hemisphere vertically
to support it they said they didn't but
if he looked like supported and now he
turned into a fart remember everybody
swing so we have to protect ourselves
from them this is just a way of cynics
finding finding somebody to blame like
he's doing it at every level take a look
right now at the attack on China
take a look at the detail collapses
instantly but the most striking thing is
he's lashing out at the World Health
Organization totally fabricated Chargers
but they have an effect which amazingly
isn't being discussed even in the
liberal approach
did he fund the world World Health
Organization's what happens in Africa
these numbers of people dies we're being
kept alive by the services provided by
the world World Health Organization so
here is a gangster in the White House
who says I'll kill lots of people in
Africa if this will help me push a
button for my voting base in Bolton get
elected you think I'm not getting plenty
of mass murderers in history anybody who
did it for something like that it passes
without comment same things going on
with the ploy with the governors he's
turning to the piece flailing about
desperately to find somebody to blame
for his criminality tens of thousands of
Americans died because he or she is
doing anything in the first couple
months with everybody else was fine
account of the virus I think they've got
a cover-up for that do you find somebody
to blame now it's the government
especially as Mitch McConnell says the
blue state they committed a crime they
paid they wasted their money on pensions
for firefighters and policemen and
teachers now that they wasted that money
we're not giving anything okay meanwhile
the airline industries which spent the
glory years buying back stocks - instead
of including services in the enterprise
to inflate the wealth of their rich
shareholders and get the CEO salary
flying to the stratosphere
we'll pay them and say exactly the
amount that they lost with me and then
the federal government Trump turns to
the states and says we can't help you
we happen to have all the resources that
we have all the will for facilities that
we can make arrangements with other
countries things you can't do but it's
your problem okay so you governor's you
try to be able to just want to lead to
catastrophes and then Trump can say
you're four be repeated on Fox News
therefore the Democrats if anything
happens at work Trump and say look what
a great genius I am greatest genius in
history it worked
Sean Hannity with the talk on Fox News
you see the greatest figures and so God
created the world this scam that
continues right now
all for personal me the effects on the
American population on the world doesn't
matter it's like turning to something
else
tearing up the Iran nuclear deal it was
in fact will be very will American
intelligence you have to tear it apart
why so it can look as if you're doing
something
it was Obama's deal so we st destroy
that's an it was the worst deal in
history because I thought I did it to do
all along I'm right I'm going to tear it
up into sharp increase intentions
conditions which could break out and do
a major war with at a stadium then
imposing sanctions which are harsh and
brutal and totally illegitimate and when
Iran is suffering from a pandemic in
large part for internal reasons make it
worse by strangling them with extra
sanction to make sure people suffered
much as possible for my benefit things
like this are going on it's hard to find
words for them belittling is never in
there strong enough I can't think of
good me worse than all of this
overshadow all by far or Trump's this
Trump's extraordinary dedication to
destroying the prospects for human life
on earth that is not an exaggeration his
massive efforts to increase the use of
fossil fuels to cut back any controls on
them this is the worst crime in history
literally it's going to make life on
earth in Kazakh and within a couple of
generations underneath he was right you
betrayed us by letting this happen he's
in the forefront and find a couple of
the minor figures of the world but
nobody else is even close
that's what adds if there's something
else which for some reason which amazes
me nobody wants to talk about Trump is
tearing to shreds the arms control
agreements which offers some limited
protection against the terminal nuclear
war tearing them apart one after the
other
Reagan's INF treaty wall Eisenhower's
Open Skies treaty on the chopping club
but the New START treaty is something
you make pretty good money
let's see in no constraints anymore on
other countries developing last week the
weapons of destruction to destroy us
yeah that's half a great for the arms
manufacturer this year they love it
exalting its huge contracts to building
weapons to destroy everything and then
more contracts to try to figure out ways
to stop other countries say to the world
because it's a good night I'm doing it
for me these things are going on before
our eyes if we don't do something to
stop them in a generation with you well
I think one of the you know we have
about 10 minutes left so may be a kind
of last question or next to last
question and to kind of build on some of
the the Q&A as well as you know we are
facing coronavirus like climate change
is both an environmental disaster and a
human disaster but these environmental
disasters show the inequality of human
society who lives and who dies who
suffers and who escapes that suffering
so how do you think going forward that
we can best as everyday people put
pressure on our government and organize
as citizens to fight this specter of
climate change that as you point out
threatens the future of life on Earth
and how do we fight the big corporations
who are who are making sure that nothing
gets done to fight that climate change
the way young people are doing them and
go beyond so take right now know the
major criminals on environmental
catastrophe or the fossil fuel
industries take the oil place the
government could buy them out and
dismantle them not on a day still need
fossil fuels for the transition theory
but they could be socialized taken over
by the government subjects of popular
controlling influence and moves slowly
put them out of business
replace them by renewable energy they
know how to do it like the Chevron major
company
small subsidiary which was working on
sustainable energy is actually quite
profitable they closed it down because
they can make more profit selling fossil
fuels to destroy the world but that's
the simplest word for day it's called
capitals no they were right that's the
way you behaved in after the society a
popular organized society under
Democratic control concerned with people
and nonprofits that make different
decisions like maybe we want our
grandchildren to survive so let's take
over the fossil fuel industries but AM
under popular control workers control
community controlling move to shift the
balance so that instead of fossil fuels
they pursue the renewable energy ok
under our control you can say this
across the court what about the big
banks I mean they're after it one of
Obama's worst actions was in 2008
congressional legislation came along
saying you have to bail out the banks
who are the perpetrators of the crisis
and you have to the legislation said you
have to provide a to the victims the
people who were kicked out of their home
foreclosures under the Clinton know
summers scam it's part of the
legislation was implement happen again
right now
why is the stimulus going to the banks
in fact of the bank's UN bailout the
function related oh maybe we oughta have
the public things which are blanks you
go back to the fifties and the sixties
before the neoliberal plate thanks for
banks if you had some extra cash you put
it in the bank they lend it out to
somebody who's just keep the controller
black or
with these neoliberal plates thanks
change radically financial institutions
pretty much took over the country I mean
their economic contribution is probably
negative not positive well one should be
be there why should we have hedge funds
it why should we have private equity
watch we have huge banks the rich are
carrying out scams to harm the
population enrich enrich the
shareholders and managers there's plenty
of opportunity the stimulus money
instead of going to the banks industry
whatever the way they like is the
managing of looking over their shoulder
to make sure that they're honest
yeah tell me another story why not have
the money go straight to the people
immediately working people I think we're
in trouble people can't pay their rent
like why not have a rent strike it's
been proposed but the stimulus go there
to the people in needed build the
country instead of going to the human
institutions which have been destroyed I
mean all of these things are within the
range of possibilities let's I'm sure
let's just take a quick look at the
Sanders campaign I'm see the way it's
portrayed in the liberal press so lest
part of the liberal approach
far left as you can go wonder Sanders is
two main policies one universal health
care the other free higher education not
look at the commentary
let's press good ideas but the country
is not ready for them I mean that is an
insult to the country or the kind that
you'd expect from its worst enemies what
is he saying can you think of a country
that has universal health care when you
think of one that doesn't have it
everywhere well rich countries poor
countries have some form of universal
health food free higher education all
over the place Germany
Mexico in fact as we were saying before
the program started here in the United
States we had well when I went to school
for college essentially free I was going
to an Ivy League college to get a
scholarship these were the GI Bill of
Rights came all free higher public
education for huge numbers of people who
would never were going to college even
subsidizing me not very good with them
very good for the country
so what Sanders is saying is let's see
if we can rise to the level of other
countries out of what we once were
that's right that's revolutionary too
much for the country to tolerate when
they chose you how much the kind of
sensible left liberal culture has just
eroded well we would be saying it's
obvious of course we do that then let's
go on to something else like if you give
if you decide to fund some enterprise
for their misdeeds
I'll put conditions on it say they have
to put workers on the board they have to
put after they have to make sure you
commit themselves never to have any more
buybacks
I was illegal for Reagan no more tax
shelters illegal for you have a insist
on a livable wage you don't do that
you're out of business we can do that
that's a step towards what could go on
beyond it this point is as we've been
talking about a little more plenty of
things within range plenty of things
that can be done it just requires
liberating yourself from the suffocating
ideological controls of the new liberal
age it's not party just means opening
your eyes looking at what's around you
and it can be done in change the world
was done in the 30s would be done now
yes and that's that's
incredibly inspiring way for us to move
toward our conclusion I think that in
the next few months we're gonna probably
be seeing serious rent strikes as the
poverty that Kovan 19 creates is going
to really take people into a desperate
scenario we're going to see increased
workers struggle we are going to see a
greater move toward organizing and I
want people to remember as we leave that
the 1929 Great Depression started in
1929 it took five years for the big
strikes of 1934 to begin to truly
transform America organizing is
happening it may be it's not always
going to happen right now
but we are seeing the beginnings of what
I think certainly is the growth of a
revived left movement that is going to
move us toward greater equality and that
requires all of us having hope and
participating and moving forward with
that instead of buying into that
neoliberal sense of individualism and
hopelessness that Professor Chomsky has
spent the last hour teaching us and so I
wanted to thank professor Chomsky for
his time we don't want to go over of
course he has many other obligations and
so I wanted finally to urge all of you
to check out more radical labor books
from the new press and more great
radical made programs at radical may dot
liberal or excuse me not liberal excuse
me radical may dot literal bcn cat or
just Google radical mag stay safe
organized with your neighbors and
coworkers
and help build a better world coming out
of this crisis Thank You professor
Chomsky thank you thank you for
everything you're doing
