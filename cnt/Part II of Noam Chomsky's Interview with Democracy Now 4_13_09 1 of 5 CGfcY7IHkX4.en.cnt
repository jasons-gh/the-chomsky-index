just out now edited by Anthony arnav
called the essential Chomsky I spoke to
Noam Chomsky earlier this month when we
were on the road in Boston this is part
two of our conversation I began by
asking him to talk about the current
economic meltdown let's start with g20
if you look at the Financial Times the
world's major business journal the day
before the g20 meeting they had a
section on it than they pointed out I
think correctly that the main purpose is
to present a picture of harmony and
agreement I don't know what to do but
make it look as if we're all together on
this now there are sharp splits about
how to approach the issue but you have
to make it look as if we're all together
that's pretty much what happened now in
the communique which you read before the
crucial word was voluntary so the
countries there are supposed to
voluntarily choose to do XY and z well
that means we couldn't make an agreement
so we'll call it voluntary agreement now
there was one point on which they agree
a sharp recapitalisation of the
International Monetary Fund for it a lot
of money into the IMF that's a pretty
dubious move I mean the record of the
IMF has be honest it's more or less a
branch of the u.s. treasury even though
it has a European
it's past role has been extremely
destructive in fact it's american-us
executive director captured its role and
she described it as the credit
communities enforcer meaning if a third
world dictator incurs a huge debt people
didn't what the dictator did say so
heart though in Indonesia and then the
debt defaults the lenders who've made
plenty of money because it was a risky
loan so they get high interest and so on
they have to be protected meaning the
not by the dictator by the people
Indonesia who are subjected to harsh
structural adjustment programs so that
they can pay back the debt which they
didn't incur so that we can be
compensated rich Westerners can be
compensated so that's the IMF credit
communities and force are very
destructive role in the third world now
it's to be recapitalised now the there
are this discussion about this and it's
interesting you can read it in the
financial pages the supporters of the
recapitalisation say well the IMF has
changed its spots it's going to be
different from now we realize that have
this terrible role but now it's going to
be different well I'm is there any
reason to believe it'll be different in
fact if you look today it's quite
striking to see the advice that the
Western powers are following the
programs that they're following and
compare them to the instructions given
to the third world so they take
Indonesia again Indonesia had a huge
financial crisis about 10 years ago and
the instructions were the standard ones
here's what you have to do first pay off
your debts to us second privatize so we
can then pick up your assets on the
cheek third raise interest rates to slow
down the economy and forth the
population and suffer you know to pay us
back those are the regular instructions
the IMF is still giving them
what do we do exactly the opposite we
forget about the dead let it explode we
reduce interest rates to zero to
stimulate the economy we pour our money
into the economy to get even bigger
debts we don't privatize we nationalize
except we don't call it nationalization
we give it some of the name like bailout
it's essentially nationalization without
control so we pour money into the
institutions we we lectured to the third
world that they must accept free trade
but we accept protectionism I take the
too-big-to-fail principle which the
house committees discussing today but
what is too big to fail me too big to
fail as an insurance policy it's a
government insurance policy government
means the public pays which says you can
take huge risks and a client profit and
if anything goes wrong we'll bail you
out that's too big to fail well that's
extreme protectionism it gives us
corporations like Citigroup an enormous
advantage over others like any other
kind of protection but we don't allow
the third world to do that they got to
privatize so that we can pick up their
assets now these are happening side by
side now here's the instructions for you
the poor people here's the policies for
us the rich people exactly the opposite
is there any reason to think the IMF is
going to change it do you think
President Obama is any different than
President Bush when it comes to the
economy and if you were in the Congress
would you have voted for the bailouts
and the stimulus packages he's different
it's a fertile as a rhetorical
difference but we have to distinguish
the first and the second Bush terms they
were different I mean the first Bush
term was so so arrogant and abrasive and
the militaristic and dismissive of
everyone that they offended antagonized
even allies close allies and us prestige
in the world plummeted as Europe
now the second Bush administration was
more move more toward the senator in
that respect not entirely but more so
some of the worst offenders like
Rumsfeld Wolfowitz and others were
thrown out they couldn't throw out Dick
Cheney because he was the administration
so they couldn't get him he stayed but
the others a lot of them left and they
moved towards somewhat more normal
position and Obama's carrying that for
he's a centrist Democrat he never really
pretended to be anything else and he's
moving towards a kind of a centrist
position he's very popular in Europe not
so much because of him but because he's
not bush so there is the kind of
rhetoric that European leaders and in
fact the European population tend to
accept in fact you know even in the
Middle East we think people would know
better there they accept the illusions
and they are illusions because there's
nothing to back them up so yes he's
different from bush same on the economy
well you know the current Obama Geithner
plan is not very different from the bush
Paulson plan I'm somewhat different but
circumstances have changed so of course
it's somewhat different but it's still
based on the principle that we have to
somehow the taxpayer has to rescue the
institution's intact they have to remain
intact including the people who
destroyed the economy in fact they're
the ones who Obama picked to fix it up
explain like Larry Summers for example
there's now his chief economic advisor I
mean he was Secretary of Treasury under
Bill Clinton his great achievement was
to prevent Congress from regulating
derivatives exotic financial instruments
well that's one of the main factors that
led to the crisis his kind of senior
advisor when the first was Robert Rubin
who was Secretary of Treasury right
before summers his main achievement many
achievements like we did Indonesian the
third world but here his main
achievement was to lead the way to
vocally glass Stegall legislation from
the New Deal which protected commercial
banks from risky and vet and investments
it broke down those barriers immediately
after having done this he left the
government to join Citigroup as a
director and they began to make huge
profits including him from picking up
insurance companies and so on and making
very risky loans relying on the
too-big-to-fail doctrine meaning if we
get in trouble the taxpayer bail us out
which is just what's happening taxpayer
is now pouring tens of billions of
dollars into rescuing Citigroup well
these are the advisors who were supposed
to fix up the system Tim Geithner was
right in the middle of this he was head
of a New York Federal Reserve so yes he
was supervising these actions you know
you can argue about whether they're
doing the right thing of the wrong thing
but are these the people who should be
fixing up the system actually the
business press has had some interesting
things to say about this Bloomberg News
you know main business breast I had an
article in which they reviewed the
records of the people who Obama invited
to his economic summit I think it must
have been last November or December it
has reviewed the record there were a
couple of dozen of them people on the
people like say stiglitz and pregnant
they were never even allowed close to it
let alone anyone from the left our labor
and so on given pokin representation so
they went through the records and they
concluded that these people should not
be invited to fix up the economy most of
them should be getting subpoenas because
of their record of accounting fraud
malpractice and so on and helping bring
about the current crisis professor Noam
Chomsky will continue the conversation
