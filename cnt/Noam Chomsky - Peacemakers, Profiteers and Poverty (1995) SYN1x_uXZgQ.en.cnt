Thanks thanks for your patience as well
well I don't know if the title that was
sent to me was also announced but if it
was you'll have noticed that it covers
about every imaginable base so I guess I
can talk about anything what I'd like to
do is to say a few words about where the
United States is going or to be more
accurate where it's being driven by
quite deliberate and conscious social
policy taking advantage of significant
changes that have occurred in the
international economy and the global
system during the past 20 25 years I'm
going to keep to the United States but
the comments that I want to make extend
in various degrees to other rich
societies the societies that commonly
indulge in the self agile ation that's
one of the prerogatives of power but
occasionally are described accurately
very occasionally for example once by
Winston Churchill at the height of
British imperial power right before the
First World War when he background he
was speaking to the British Cabinet and
he pointed out calling for rearmament
and he said we have got all we want in
territory and wish only to be left alone
in unmolested enjoyment of vast and
splendid possessions mainly acquired by
violence largely maintained by force and
then he says this often seems less
reasonable than to others than it does
to us for some reason which means that
various measures have to be taken to
teach reasonableness well
Churchill was alert enough to realize
that that's not for the public ears
was a secret cabinet meeting and when
parts of it did reach the public about
20 years later it was carefully
sanitized but has emerged 75 years later
in release documents and maybe if one
were to explore documents more carefully
you might even find some accurate
descriptions in our internal record
well what seemed unreasonable to others
also seemed quite unreasonable to more
humane people in Imperial England some
of them quite well known for example
Adam Smith 200 years ago 1776 who
denounced what he called the savage and
justice of the Europeans who were then
devastating much of the world and in
fact creating the first world third
world division that exists today and
doing it with ample savagery is Adam
Smith understood
and as he condemned and he also
understood something else that Churchill
didn't mention in these remarks namely
that there's a domestic analogue that is
the we who want to enjoy their vast and
splendid possessions were not the people
of England or the people of France or
America or others but rather a sector
among among them those who Smith
described as the principal architects of
policy who used their power their
control over the economy to design
policy so that it would be so that their
own interests would be as he put it most
peculiarly attended to no matter how
Grievous the impact on others including
the people of England he spoke
particularly of the manufacturers and
merchants of England who were designing
using power to design state policy in
this fashion following what he called
the vile maxim of the Masters of mankind
all for ourselves and nothing for anyone
else
recall that Adam Smith there's a
mythical Adams
you're thought about and there's a real
one who was saying things like this he
was a pre-capitalist
thinker with roots in the Enlightenment
and he regarded all of this is
outrageous and he also insisted on
relative equality of condition as an
elementary principle of justice and
morality a position in which he was
joined by Benjamin Franklin and James
Madison and Thomas Jefferson and
authentic conservatives like de
Tocqueville years later all of whom also
recognized that it's a prerequisite for
anything remotely like democracy
these were truisms hundreds of years ago
and they remain true today even though
they're regularly denied
well these same issues arose very
prominently at the foundation of this
country among the founding fathers of
American democracy at pretty much the
same time a few years later ten years
later in 1787 at the Constitutional
Convention James Madison who was
basically the main framer of the
Constitution emphasized to the
convention that the first priority of
government must be as he put it to
protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority and in fact the
system was designed very specifically
and consciously to that in power had to
be placed in the hands of the owners of
property Madison insisted so that the
minority the opulent could be projected
protected against the majority in a
formally democratic system that's the
way it was designed and that's the way
it remained now Madison had a rather
naive belief that the minority of the
opulent would behave as enlightened
civilized gentlemen like the Republican
Romans of his imagination imagination I
stress but he soon discovered that that
reality was
pretty far from the reality it was quite
different and within a few years seeing
what had happened
Madison deplored what he called the
daring depravity of the times as the
wealthy came to use their control of
government exactly as Adam Smith had
described put it in well using Madison's
own words he said the stock jabbers are
becoming the Praetorian band of
government at once its tool and it's
tyrant bribed by its largesses
and over owned it by its clamors and
combinations earlier in this century the
same thought was put more simply by
America's leading social philosopher
John Dewey who pointed out that politics
is the shadow cast by big business over
society and as long as the substance
isn't changed attenuation of the shadow
changes at the margins will be useful
but limited let me stress that these are
true isms they've been truisms for 200
years and they're true isms that are
well to bear in mind
well these struggles struggles between
the minority of the opulent and the
majority which were well understood 200
years ago by leading thinkers that we're
supposed to revere but not read they
remain the leading themes of history and
it's worth I think it's pertinent today
to remember how they've been played out
over the years obviously I can't run
through that but I'll mention a few
points which I think are worth bearing
in mind in the mid 19th century in the
United States there was a lively and
vigorous independent labor press mainly
in places like not too far from here in
fact the Lawrence and Lowell and the
working-class towns of northeastern
United States where the Industrial
Revolution was taking place and indeed
that independent labor press remained
for a long time as late as the 1950s
there were still about 800 labor news
papers reaching about 30 million people
later they were that was the tail end
after that they were wiped out by
concentrations of corporate capital and
they're very interesting reading the the
press was run by working people by what
they called factory girls young women
off the farms who were working in the
Lowell mills or artisans and mechanics
and they denounced what they called the
new spirit of the age gained wealth for
getting all but self in other words
Smith's by all Maxim which they called a
demeaning and a degrading doctrine that
was destroying the revolutionary
heritage of the United States destroying
democratic rights destroying elementary
human values even destroying their
surprisingly high cultural level of
those days all exactly as Adam Smith and
James Madison and particularly Thomas
Jefferson had warned would happen thanks
these conflicts the conflict of ordinary
people with the new spirit of the age
continued have continued right up until
the present there have been many
victories for freedom and democracy and
human rights there they have been gained
by often quite bitter struggle and there
have been many periods of decline and
defeat and again that cycle is well to
remember about a hundred years ago the
famous artisan radical artisan William
Morris in England wrote I know that it
is the received opinion that the
competitive devil take the hindmost
system that now prevails is perfection
and therefore finality has been reached
in it but if history is really at an end
in this devil take the hindmost system
this vile system as he described it then
civilization will die however he went on
to say that despite the opinion of
learned men that history is at an end
all of history says that this is not so
the claims or claims have been made
before or unfortunately were false and
he was right this
we'll continued continued with victories
and defeats in the United States the
repression of working people was
unusually violent and severe by
international standards it scandalized
even the right-wing British and other
European press by the 1920s the opulent
minority again believed that history was
at an end that perfection was in sight
in the United States and that the vile
Maxim that Smith condemned could rule
unchallenged Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare
the end of World War one had pretty much
demolished and destroyed the union
movement the labor movement had
undermined independent thought and it
had established an era of business
dominance that was expected at that time
to be permanent working people had no
power and very little hope at the peak
of the automobile boom of the 1920s the
big industrial development any rights
that they had were at the tolerance of
employers one foreign visitor observed
with some amazement comparing the United
States with comparable countries the
leading labor historian in the United
States University professor David
Montgomery comments correctly that
modern America was created over the
protests of its working people vigorous
and outspoken protests and fierce
struggles as he puts it with hard-won
victories but also periods of forced
accommodation to a most undemocratic
America notably in the 1920s
well again the predictions of the end of
history were proven wrong within a few
years
popular struggles had considerably
extended human rights and democracy even
gaining for working people in the United
States the rights that they had achieved
decades earlier throughout most of the
industrial world in Europe Australia and
elsewhere
well the achievement of those rights
during the 30s and mister
of the 30s that gave rise very quickly
to new conflicts as the minority of the
opulent sought to contain these
achievements in fact the achievement of
ordinary what had long been regarded as
ordinary rights for working people in
the 1930s the achievement of that in the
United States set off real fury and the
organized business community the
National Association of Manufacturers
reacted by warning of what it called the
hazard facing industrialists in the
rising political power of the masses
incidentally if that terminology
surprises you and sounds like a Maoist
text you have to remember that the
business community is vulgar Marxist as
is the government with the values
reverse and that kind of terminology
about the rising political power of the
masses and all that sort of thing is
perfectly standard in government
documents and business press there they
see themselves as fighting a vicious
class war and always have the evidence
on that is overwhelming well they were
were they warned that unless the
thinking of the masses is redirected we
will be facing a disaster and in fact a
serious counter-attack was launched
right at in the late 1930s it was put on
hold during war but picked up with great
vigor after World War two there was a
quite spectacular campaign propaganda
and everything else to try to overcome
the rising political power of the masses
and to save our preferred way of life as
business leaders put it they described
the task as continuing with the
everlasting battle for the minds of men
we have to indoctrinate people with the
capitalists story we have three to five
years it was claimed to save our
American what they called our American
Way of life against this rising
political power of the man
and a huge campaign was undertaken the
scale of it is pretty spectacular by the
early 1950s about one-third of the
materials and schools around the country
were being provided by business as
straight business propaganda about 20
million people a week we're watching
propaganda films the resources of the
entertainment industry were mobilized to
try to portray there were several major
goals one was to portray unions as the
enemy of the working people on the
waterfront Marlon Brando's famous
example you know honest working man
stands up against tough Indian bosses
and everyone ends up happy to create a
picture of harmony and Americanism
meaning the hard-working executive and
the sober workman and the housewife busy
taking care of the kids all together
against these outsiders who are trying
to cause disruption by organizing people
and getting them to try to fight for
their rights and so on and so forth the
campaign was extraordinary in scale it
attacked it targeted the churches the
schools and universities even
recreational programs to win the
everlasting battle for the minds of men
and to indoctrinate people with the
capitalists story and to try to get one
crucial part of it which has a lot of
resonance today is to try to get people
to hate the government there's a good
reason for that the government whatever
you think of even though the business
knew as well as anybody that government
is the shadow cast by big business over
Society nevertheless government has a
fatal flaw that corporate power doesn't
have in principle it's possible for
people to participate in it and to
influences in contrast corporations are
private tyrannies they're totalitarian
and structure they're unaccountable and
there's no way for the population to
become involved in their decisions or
even to know what they are government
however well controlled by the substance
behind the shadow has the flaw that it
is
the Democratic and therefore it makes
good sense to try to direct people's
hatred and anger and fear and so on
against government and to keep the
shadow the substance behind it very well
hidden that is the main theme of the
massive propaganda to which people are
subjected from every point of view and
the end result is the mood that's called
anti politics if you're angry and you
have good reasons to be angry for most
of the population directed against the
gut of government not against the
fortune 500 just pay attention to the
shadow not the substance that and the
attack on efforts of people to organize
and to realize the rising the potential
rising political power of the masses
those are the major themes of very
spectacular propaganda campaigns there's
actually some pretty good scholarly work
that's just come out in the last couple
of years on these topics and I thought I
knew something about it but it's pretty
remarkable to see what the scale was and
acun self consciousness well that had
its effect we're again now in one of
those periods when the end of history is
being predicted once again we're in the
midst of an area you're of a kind of
rollback a very vigorous attack on
freedom and human rights and democratic
values and even an attack on markets
contrary to what's being claimed and
it's well to bear in mind the lessons of
history which are rich and valuable the
Utopia of the Masters guided by the vile
Maxim that's been proclaimed over and
over again always wrongly because people
have always found ways to get together
and to struggle for decent human values
and there's no reason to believe today
that the civilization will die and that
what Madison called the depravity of the
times will be permanent again
good look at history shows that things
aren't all that different than they've
been before and the hopes that were
realized before can be again
well another accurate description of the
rich country is the so called developed
world can be read alongside of
Churchill's was given a couple of weeks
ago by Carol Bellamy she's the new
director of UNICEF an American of course
appointed as usual under quite
considerable strong US pressure but she
released the latest UNICEF annual report
on state of the world's children in
which she concluded the report concluded
that thirteen million children die every
year from malnutrition and easily
treatable diseases that's up from about
11 million a few years ago these are
lives that could be saved with pennies
of aid the report went on to say that
tens of millions of children could be
saved from mental retardation and
physical disaster at a cost that they
estimate at five cents per person per
year in the rich countries well that
wasn't reported in the national press
however the press did report that on the
same day Congress had called for a cut
of one-third in the US funds for UN
agencies including UNICEF so maybe if
we're lucky this bet can go up to maybe
20 million a year and another year or
two and also call it for terminating or
mostly eliminating foreign aid the
United States already has the most
miserly record in the developed world
and long has and if you put aside the a
the biggest component of aid which
happens to go to a very rich country
namely Israel if you eliminate that then
we're just off the spectrum completely
off the spectrum of developed societies
that timing was
tortoise but you wouldn't have known it
unless you somehow found out that UNICEF
had a press conference that day well
this is by no means a response to public
opinion quite the contrary
public opinion continues to show what
the pollsters point out our strong
majorities not only in favour of foreign
aid if it reaches the poor but of even
for increased strong majorities in
favour of increased taxes for foreign
firm or foreign aid that reaches the
poor this is only one example of a very
consistent pattern in the last couple of
months that the allegedly poll driven
policies that are being undertaken are
radically opposed to the opinions of the
general population but they are favored
by the minority of the opulent and
therefore they are being put through and
if you look just at the headlines you'll
think that the public supports them
that's true in case after case in fact
almost without exception take the
biggest case the but balanced budget
efforts you know the headlines
repeatedly tell you yeah people strongly
in favor of a balanced budget we have to
push that through well there's a sense
in that in which that's true if you ask
people would you like to have a balanced
budget people would say sure you know me
too so you get very high numbers in
support of a balanced budget if you ask
people would you like to have all your
household debts cancelled by magic
they'd say yeah terrific
you know so people are in favor of
canceling household debt on the other
hand if you go down below the headline
and you look at the data and you ask a
sensible question which is down there
maybe somewhere at the end of the column
or maybe not not if you ask people would
you want a balanced budget if it's going
to mean cuts in education or health or
environmental protection and so on then
the figures go down to like twenty
percent in favor or maybe 25 percent in
favor so in other words there's
overwhelming opposition to the only
serious question but that you're not
supposed to notice and since the
minority the opulent are in favor of it
as a technique of destroying even the
quite limited by comparative standards
quite limited welfare systems in the
United States it's being rammed through
and the same in case after case after
case if you look carefully well again
there's a domestic analog to what UNICEF
reported about the suffering of children
throughout the world because of lack of
pennies of Aid the domestic analog is
right here it's one aspect of the
project that's now underway to try to
turn the United States itself into a
kind of a third world Society it's not
going to be it's a rich very super rich
country so it's not going to look like
Brazil or Mexico but to impose the
structure of a third world society that
is a sector of great opulence a large
number of people who are suffering or
maybe miserable and then a huge mass of
people who are just a perf loose who
people who contribute nothing to
profit-making which is the only human
value and therefore have no human rights
well if it's one of our say dependencies
like say Columbia or someplace like that
you just kill them where you send out
the death squads you carry out social
cleansing or something like something of
that sort in a more civilized country
like ours
what you do is coupe um up into urban
slums which increasingly resemble
concentration camps in which they can
prey on one another or just throw them
in jail
the prison population is through the
nineteen eighty used to be about up
about nineteen eighty it was more than
west at the level of other countries it
more than tripled during the 1980s it's
still going up there isn't any other
country in the developed world or in
fact anywhere in the world it's even
close to it in per capita imprisonment
except for one Russia just caught up
with us after the they picked up
American values after 1989 but aside
from that example we're way ahead of
everyone else well that's the sort of
civilized equivalent of death squads and
social cleansing and effect if you it's
not that crime has gone off crime is
pretty stable
it's been stable for about twenty years
serious but hadn't changed maybe even
declining but there is a superfluous
population they got to be controlled and
plenty of people gain by this remember
this has become a big industry private
prison systems are now pretty wealthy
operations they're privatized of course
Lee everything else you meaning more
profit can be made in fact there was a
big article in The Wall Street Journal
about it him read a year ago pointing
out that the big investment firms are
making lots of money floating bonds for
new prisons Merrill Lynch and the rest
of them and furthermore that high-tech
industry the military industry what's
mislabel defense industry has realized
that they can get in the act here's
another cash cow you know another form
of public subsidy to high tech industry
alongside that smaller than the Pentagon
but still substantial and growing which
they can get into by selling high-tech
surveillance techniques you know
sticking electrodes and people and
monitoring them with supercomputers and
so on and so forth
other kinds of scams of the sort that
have kept high tech industry going at
the public expense so it's another form
of Keynesian stimulation of the economy
public subsidy of private profit and can
be expected to grow because of these
various contributions to social welfare
well as part of this process of trying
to create a sort of a model of the third
world in a super rich society which you
can't miss walking through any American
city now begins to look more and more
like third world cities one part of the
process is the domestic analogue of the
attack on children throughout the world
and or simply the domestic analogue of
malnutrition and starvation throughout
the world the United States is without
parallel in a developed world in the
level of malnutrition and often
starvation it reached about 30 million
people by 1990 including 12 million
children and one out of six of the
elderly many of whom are literally
starving The Wall Street Journal's went
an article that year remember this is
the richest country in the world with
absolutely unparalleled Vantage's I mean
the idea that anybody is starving is a
scandal but the levels are way beyond
anything else in the developed world in
the in 1990-1991 that's before the bush
recession which made things even worse
and the clinton recovery which was
historically unique in that its first
time that median wages real wages
continued to decline that's a decline
that's been going on since 1980 they
continued to decline right through the
recovery they're still declining right
now maybe even faster in the poverty
level in the United States is about
double that of comparably rich societies
children poverty among children's about
triple the level of other societies the
benefit the welfare system is extremely
limited as compared with other
comparable societies and one effect of
that is that the effect of government
spending reduces child poverty much less
than it does in other societies far less
and then during the Reagan years went
down it had been it take New York City
the richest city in the world 40 percent
of children are now below the poverty
line that means lacking sufficient food
to maintain growth and development in
many cases inequality in Manhattan is
now greater than Guatemala
you know what Central America is like
we'll know what that means
in Boston which is another rich City the
City Hospital the one that's deals
that's offer services to the poor people
or though it probably won't pretty soon
because they're being eliminated it had
to establish a malnutrition clinic a
couple of years ago for the first time
ever because it was dealing with
third-world levels of malnutrition
among children which got much worse over
the winter not surprisingly when parents
had to make the agony
decision as to whether to feed the
children or heat their houses that's
unheard of and developed societies the
there are now tens of millions of people
who lack health insurance that's
increasing as I mentioned the crime rate
has been stable or even declining for
about twenty years but the prison
population is booming support systems
for the poor have declined very sharply
since the last since the 1970s if he
takes a afdc the one everyone talks
about aides for families with dependent
children that's been cut by about half
since 9th inst the early 1970s that was
already very low by international
standards to begin with it's now being
cut very sharply maybe another five or
six to seven million children will be
knocked off the rolls kids aged about
average age about seven who have to
learn responsibility were told the 1980s
were a period of relative there was some
economic growth relatively low by
post-war standards but there was some
about 60% of the new wealth that was
created went to the top 1% of the
population and about 40% of families
declined in absolute terms during this
period median real wages have declined
steadily since 1980 right until today
the for the majority of workers that
means men with only without college
education real income has declined over
20 percent since 1980 that's the source
of the famous angry white male syndrome
that you hear about since 1987 took a
couple of years for the Reagan reforms
to come in but they by 1987 they were
hitting even college-educated people and
their college-educated wages started
going down in 1987 most striking has
been the decline in entry-level wages
the wages that you get when you first
get a job that's declined 30% for males
18% for female since nineteen
eighty that's a portent of the future
meanwhile working hours are going up
there's people are working an average of
about two weeks per year over what they
were in 1980 the effect of these changes
has been to drive lots of women into the
workforce day care or any other kind of
child care is impossibly expensive the
United States does not have the support
systems for parents that other countries
have so for example parental leave for
childbirth is way lower than other
countries in fact it's lower just to
give you an example it's lower than the
standards for plantation workers in
Uganda at the moment and remember this
is the richest country in the world the
effect of all of this is the people are
doing it simply because there's no other
way to provide food for their kids you
want to provide food you work 50-hour
weeks to parents otherwise no way with
wages going down and benefits going down
and working hours going up and you have
no choices because there's no unions
they've been destroyed so there's no
chance of organizing to react to this
the and since there's no very limited
daycare and other support system kids
are just left alone one effect is the
contact time between parents and
children has declined about 40% in the
last generation that's substantial
high-quality contact time even more the
kids kids are left alone you get
latchkey children so-called television
and supervision with the obvious effects
violence by children against children
drug abuse breakdown of families and so
on
it's no secret all of this has been
studied in detail for example but in a
recent UNICEF report written by a well
known American economist so and Hulett
who compared the way in which the rich
societies school child neglect in rich
societies in which the rich societies
were developing and dealing with the
problems that all faced since the 1970s
she found two quite different models as
an anglo-american which he called
neglect filled model which
has been a disaster for children and
families and a European Japanese model
which facing the same conditions
improved their already better
circumstances considerably during the
same period this is a deliberate war
deliberate war against families and
children which has been amazingly enough
carried out under the banner of Family
Values and conservatism that's a real
tribute to the educated classes to be
able to pull that one off as is the fact
that the studies of the topic like the
UNICEF study and others like it are
unreviewed unmentionable try to find a
mention of them as far as I know the
only mention that exists is in an
article of mine and the magazine on when
the UNICEF study came out they're just
not part of the debate because this is
not the right thing to think about if
you want to fight the everlasting battle
to control the minds of men well like I
say that's a tribute to the educated
classes the classes that we're part of
the official story which you hear over
and over again is that these are lean
and mean times and we all have to
tighten our belts that is total hogwash
the country is absolutely awash in
capital and the while median wages have
been going down in the manner that I
described corporate salaries for example
executive pay has has risen 66% during
the same period capital gains are up
about the same amount 66% they now form
about half the income of the top 1% of
the population incidentally if these new
flat tax proposals that are being tossed
about go through that warning be taxable
which means half of the income for the
top 1% will be tax free this is the
ratio of corporate pay executive pay to
manufacturing workers pay is far higher
in the United States than any other
developed country and the
enormous increase in the last year's is
essentially closer to unparalleled
except in England the business press of
course is totally euphoric about this
you don't read about lately Nemean times
in Business Week and fortune and so on
Financial Times quite the contrary there
are euphoric they have headlines like
fortune a couple of weeks ago on why
profits will keep booming an article
lead article which points out that in
1993 profits were dazzling despite
according it stagnant virtually stagnant
sales and continuing decline of wages
nineteen eighty ninety four they say was
even worse splendid it was the fourth
straight year of double-digit profit
growth and they expect to continue at
least until 1996 meanwhile there's an
there's an annual study called the state
of working America the main scholarly
study of working people in the country
and it predicts Michelle and Bernstein
that wages will continue their decline
while profits continue this completely
unprecedented growth our earnings per
share have doubled since nineteen ninety
one return on capital has more than
doubled since 1980 it's not that
business was without problems so you can
read a headline in Businessweek saying
the problem now what to do with all that
cash as surging profits are overflowing
the coffers of corporate America and
dividends are booming thanks in large
measure to profits from overseas
operations that's what's called working
for jobs for Americans when you listen
to it there's a well-oiled profit
machine another article says that
reporting the first quarter of 1995
which had a 30 percent leap in profits
which is pretty spectacular although
they say less than the phenomenal 74
percent advance of the last quarter of
1994 the Fortune 500 which comes out
every year with a big study at the top
500 corporations this year May 15 was
absolutely ecstatic profits they said
were up a stunning
quoting at stunning 54% on a sales
growth of 8% an employment growth of 2.6
percent and declining wages the is one
of the most profitable years ever for
American business and this series of
increasing profit is unprecedented the
revenues of the fourth referred fortune
500 they say now constitute 63% of total
gross domestic product in the United
States
that's more than Germany more than the
United Kingdom in addition to that this
huge control over the International
economy and somebody there's a degree of
power over the international and
domestic society in the hands of real
totalitarian institutions because
remember these are private unaccountable
tyrannies that's I think without
precedent it's hard to find a precedent
for that and it's going up it's
interesting to look at the particular
cases if you look at the fortune 500
list you'll find that some of the
biggest increases are one of the biggest
increases and what they call sales is
manpower incorporated by sales they mean
selling people to as temporary workers
they provide temporary replacement
workers they their sales increased 35%
Kelly the next biggest one not much less
than that way up on the fortune 500 one
of the biggest employers now the point
of that is to make labor markets what
are called flexible study economics you
learn that it's good for labor markets
to be flexible and to avoid market
rigidities those are fancy words which
mean that it's bad for the economy if
people can go to sleep at night and with
any confidence that they're going to
have a job the next day that is bad for
something that's called economic health
that's another technical term which has
nothing to do with the health of the
economy but has a lot to do with the
health of the minority the opulent so
labor markets are getting a lot more
flexible and they're eliminating
rigidities like contracts and
expectation of a job and
that sort of thing which we all know is
terribly bad another one that another
corporation an interesting one that shot
way up last year was caterpillar up
profits up 46% dividends up about the
same amount that's extremely important
because right now in Decatur Illinois
one of the most important labor actions
of modern maybe all of American history
certainly modern American history is
going on a major effort by three major
corporations caterpillar one British
owned multinational on a Japanese owned
multinational to destroy really destroy
the last what there is left of American
industrial unions and the caterpillar
corporation has explained they're kind
enough to explain its strategy to the
business press reports namely they want
to you they have been using their
enormous profits to develop excess
capacity overseas not for reasons of
economic efficiency but for reasons of
class warfare because if you develop
excessive excess capacity in Brazil or
Japan or Europe and then there's a
strike in Decatur Illinois you can
figure market orders from those from the
excess capacity and therefore undermine
and destroy the workers and Decatur
Illinois well that's a good way to drive
the third to turn the country into a
third world country in the in nineteen
eighty five labor costs which means
essentially wages and benefits in the
United States were the highest in the
developed world exactly as you would
expect in their richest and most
privileged country in the world by 1990
thanks to the Reaganite measures
including the really criminal
destruction of unions in which they
simply the government simply told
employers they're not going to enforce
the law so do anything you feel like the
by 1990 the United States had reached
the lowest level in the developed world
it was then passed by England in the
competition to see who can crush working
people most and by 1992 a second lowest
in the developed world one of the reason
is stature so it
I heard here The Wall Street Journal had
an article on that describing it as a
welcome development of transcendent
importance which indeed it is for the
minority of the opulent the
International Business Press has pointed
out that international conditions make
it offer new ways to do to achieve this
not only can say General Motors
either sinned or threatened to send
production down to Mexico and Brazil and
so on but now they've got a new third
world or rather an old third world that
has been returned to Western control
namely Eastern Europe it's good bit of
what the Cold War was about and now of
course things in Eastern Europe were
terrible the press points out but it was
a article in Financial Times which is
the major international business press
called green shoots and communism ruins
saying well you know it's pretty rotten
but there's some green shoots there's
some good things the green shoots turn
out to be as they put it that the that
with the economic reforms so called the
pauperization and of workers and the
unemployment has reached such high
levels that Western corporations can now
get workers in Eastern Europe at ten
percent the wages of the pampered
Western workers who will have to give up
their luxurious lifestyles as
Businessweek chimed in well as I say
that tells me a lot about what the Cold
War was about well this is a picture of
what's going on there are no lean and
mean times there's plenty of capital
it's just being very highly concentrated
in the right hand the hands of the
minority of the opulent well what should
we do in the face of these catastrophic
consequences of contemporary state
capitalism the press has told us so the
New York Times awhile back had a first
page front-page story with a headline
that read New York is simply not wealthy
enough to afford services to the general
public
read on the source for this insight was
an expert opinion namely a report to
invest
by the JPMorgan Corporation which is
fifth among the banks in the fortune 500
suffering from mere one point two
billion dollars in profits last year
which incidentally is actually rather
low as compared with its competitors who
did far better so have some tears for
them so the report to investors to of JP
Morgan which made it to the headline of
the front page at the time says New York
is simply not wealthy enough to afford
services to the general public so what's
the solution
well the solution is to cut taxes on the
rich again the small print and the back
page is pointed out that all the tax
cuts benefit business so you cut taxes
on the rich but you increase taxes on
the poor except you don't call them on
everybody else that's not the poor
that's the great majority you increase
taxes on everybody else but you don't
call them taxes that's very important
for those of you looking for
you know employment in serious places
you raise taxes but you don't call them
taxes what you call them is I'm quoting
multi-million dollar reductions in
subsidies for cities Macke mass transit
and aid to education and higher
education education and higher education
instantly the word subsidies is kind of
interesting if the population of New
York City decides to use their money to
improve their public transportation
system that's a subsidy but let's put
that aside by the multi-million dollar
reductions in the subsidies to mass
transit and eggs education you simply
increase the costs for the people who
use mass transit and education obviously
the already astronomical subway costs go
up as they are the costs of getting an
education go up and somebody pays those
costs and they pay them to the city so
their taxes or rather their equivalent
of taxes but they're highly regressive
taxes the subway costs are not paid by
the guys in the limousines up on the
street they're paid by the people who
are trying to get to work or the school
show
trying to get to school so it's a highly
regressive tax which is designed
essentially to redistribute income like
social policy generally cut taxes for
the rich increase taxes on a poorer but
don't call them taxes and poor means
most everybody remember another aspect
of it as this this article happens to
point out that so does a thousand others
that you've read is that it's necessary
to compel welfare recipients to work now
there's some interesting assumptions
there one assumption is that a woman
who's raising children isn't working
that comes free does anybody know if
she's ever done it remember and in fact
notice that that's true of women's work
generally comes free so it's not work
and we even have a proof of that because
says you're all taught in school we live
in a meritocracy and you can determine
the value of work by the amount of
income that accrues to it well mothers
who are raising children don't get any
income so that's not work at all on the
other hand a really meritorious work is
say a speculation in financial markets
to try to against currencies to try to
drive down international growth rates so
the people all around the world get
queer that gets a lot of money in fact
that's one of the highest-paid
occupations as is being an accountant
for a corporation and so on so in other
words those are the really meritorious
our employment the most meritorious work
real work as compared with just raising
children which isn't work at all
so therefore mothers who are raising
children have to be driven into the
workforce to do some real work there's a
side benefit of that the side benefit is
that since there are any jobs that are
going to have to get low paid publicly
subsidized jobs and since they're very
low paid it'll have the side benefit of
competing with union wages and driving
down wages for everybody so by driving
down these non-working mothers into the
workforce by driving them into the
workforce at low wages you can drive
down everybody's wages well business is
worrying about the prowl
of corporate coffers overflowing the the
Insano there's another side aspect of
this to those of you who are studying
economics maybe you know is it a kind of
odd contradiction internal to all of
this which somehow doesn't seem to
bother anyone we have to drive these
women who are just raising children are
not working we have to drive them into
the workforce because obviously it's
unfair for them to you know get paid for
doing nothing on the other hand we have
to keep the unemployment level high
that's a principle which is advocated by
the very same people this is what's
called a natural rate of unemployment it
has to be kept around 6% according to
the current theology because if you
don't keep it at 6% you know maybe
workers will be able to ask for higher
wages and all sorts of tragedies like
that so in the one hand you have to keep
unemployment high on the other hand you
have to drive women who are just raising
children not working into the workforce
exactly how you resolve that
contradiction hasn't been explained yet
but you know person has the answer the
mayor of New York did have an answer he
finally came clean honest a couple of
weeks ago he came out and said look
those policies that are being carried
out as was obvious from looking at them
are designed to drive poor people out of
the city there's no place for them in
New York in New York the only place is
for the meritocracy the people like the
JPMorgan executives and the ones are
speculating against currencies and so on
only the meritocracy as a place in New
York and that of course will follow from
depriving the rest of them the
nonmeritorious of ability to pay their
rent or to you know ride on the subway
or to have food or to heat their homes
or eliminating health health care for
the elderly and the disabled and so on
that leaves just the right people the
minority the opulent the rest'll
presumably live around the border
somewhere and what they call favelas
Rio de Janiero they can't be too far
away because they have to somehow be
able to drift into the city to do all
the dirty work but they should be out on
the outside and the typical third-world
model and the time New York Times
reported that another front-page story
which explained that I have to quote
this it explained that these measures
will enable the poor to move freely
around the country the measures that
we're talking about are deprivation of
rent heat food transit and so on that's
going to enable the poor to travel to
move freely around the country the
headline read welfare cuts provide a
chance to move in other words the rough
way as all these people were trapped by
this dependency you know and now they're
finally liberated and they're free to
move around the country but not too far
away because somebody's got to clean our
laundry so they're now free liberated I
mean you know the compassion brings
tears to the eyes it's impossible to be
a satirist anymore as a number of people
have pointed out it used to try the
world is just satirizing itself you know
you're lost no hope well there's a name
for all of this it's called tough love
and it's not a bad phrase if you think
about it I mean what it means is love
for the minority the opulent and tough
for everybody else but so yeah and there
has to be tough love for the majority
the people in New York because JPMorgan
has explained the city isn't wealthy
enough to keep them there
there's no tough love on the other hand
for say Cobb County Georgia to pick an
example at random not quite because it's
the district of Newt Gingrich who's
heading this campaign Cobb County
Georgia is a very rich suburb of Atlanta
carefully insulated from any urban
infection very rich
it says Gingrich describes it and Norman
Rockwell were
of jet planes and fiber optics it's
accurate if you know anything about jet
planes and fiber optics you will
instantly discover why Cobb County is
rich jet planes and fiber optics are two
of the many examples of the public
subsidy of big corporations that's
called free enterprise free enterprise
means public subsidy and private profit
and jet planes and fiber optics like
computers and electronics and just about
everything else in the high-tech economy
is exactly an example of that public
pays the costs
private enterprise gets the profit
so in fact Cobb County happens to get
more federal subsidies than any suburban
County in the country with two
interesting exceptions one is Arlington
Virginia which is part of the part of
Washington DC so that's like where the
Pentagon is and so on and the other is
these Brevard County Florida which is
the home of the Kennedy Space Center
that's another scam by which the public
pays the costs of high-tech industry you
know pretending they're putting men on
the moon and that sort of business the
so aside from the federal system itself
Cobb County happens you get more federal
subsidies than anyone else
in other words Newt Gingrich is the
biggest welfare freak in the country
well he's and that's and here there is
no
[Applause]
furthermore if you look at the details
of how it goes it's very enlightening
the biggest employer in Cobb County
which remember is the home of
entrepreneurial values where people
despise the nanny state and want to get
it out of their hair so that you know
their individual entrepreneurial
commitments can flourish the biggest
employer there is Lockheed now Lockheed
Martin corporation Lockheed Martin which
just merged two big military industries
which just merge and have their
corporate headquarters there they are a
typical prototypical example of publicly
subsidized private profit corporations
to call Lockheed Martin a case
of individual entrepreneurial values
that's beyond the level of sat there I
guess but that's what it's called when
they merged as payment for their merger
they requested the Clinton
administration which will probably do it
to pay them well over a billion dollars
meanwhile the executives paid themselves
about ninety million dollars about large
part of it maybe thirty million or so
from public detect funds more
entrepreneurial values right now they're
in line for a seventy two billion dollar
subsidy for f-22 jet planes and we need
F twenty-twos and Lockheed Marietta
explains why if you read their
statements they say we need f-22s
because I'm quoting it's a dangerous
world in which sophisticated fighter
planes are being sold well by whom are
sophisticated fighter planes being sold
well it turns out by lucky so I'm
continuing we've sold f-16s the current
you know top-of-the-line plane we've
sold f-16s all over the world what if a
friend or ally turns against us so
therefore we need F twenty-twos to
defend ourselves against the danger that
the f-16s that we're saying we're
sending to various dictatorships might
turn against us actually the US has
about three-quarters of that market
going to public opinion a hear public
opinion is only ninety six percent
opposed to the policy so I guess you
could say it's pretty popular but
Sanders but we got to keep doing this
because in fact they're upgraded f-16 so
the taxpayers paying multiple-- they're
paying Lockheed to upgrade the f-16 so
they can sell them the third world
dictatorships with the support of four
percent of the population so that then
maybe they can turn against us so we'll
need F twenty-twos which you guys will
pay for to defend ourselves against this
threat well that's the way it works if
you go looking on at the military
journals like
defense weekly the major British based
military Journal you get a little more
insight into it you can discover that
the Air Force director of Science and
Technology general Richard Paul
explained that this is going to as he
put it enhance our economic security how
by spinning off dual use technology
that's a fancy term that means welfare
for high-tech industry dual use
technology means you pretend it's for
jet planes to defend yourself against
somebody but in fact you use it for
commercial production so then you can
you know praise your entrepreneurial
values and denounce the nanny state
which is paying for all of this
it's welfare for corporate America in
other words which is General Paul put it
we'll transition our work in other words
which will pick up the money that we're
giving them thanks to the public pay off
well that's this is not a subsidy
incidentally this is not like money that
goes to mass transit or education so
this is not a subsidy and in fact that
it is not a subsidy was pointed out
right at the end of the Second World War
when the whole system was instituted by
the Secretary of the Air Force Stuart
Symington good liberal Democrat
incidentally who pointed out that he was
often called this the senator from
Boeing became a senator the Secretary of
the Air Force recognized as did the
business community generally that well
as Fortune magazine put it high-tech
industry could not survive an
unsubsidized competitive free enterprise
economy and therefore the government has
to step in to be the savior but we must
not Symington went on to say we should
not call it subsidy we should call it
security in other words you guys out
there are supposed to be thinking you're
paying for your security against
somebody you know Martians or maybe
people in the third world who were
selling f-16s to or something but we
know it's subsidy and in fact it is the
entire virtually the entire functioning
part of the advanced sector of the
economy lives
that public public subsidy that's
well-known in the business community not
reported very much you'll have to look
pretty hard for it it's not counted when
people do talk about corporate welfare
now and then but they rarely if ever
talk about the most serious part of it
which is this part by far so that's not
subsidy that's security and in fact
that's exactly that's the main reason in
my opinion why that Pentagon spending is
staying very high it's now not very far
from average cold war levels about
fifteen percent below it's actually
higher in real terms than it was under
Nixon the Heritage Foundation which is
you know the big right-wing think-tank
that proposes the plans that the
Gingrich army implements they recently
came out with their new budget proposal
which is to cut everything that might
help ordinary people but to increase
Pentagon spending because they know
perfectly well that the state sector of
the economy is critically important as
to put money into the pockets of the
folks in Cobb County and others like
them so they can rail against the nanny
state and insist on tough love for other
people well how about the public opinion
on that the same of all public spending
Pentagon spending has the lowest support
that is the greatest opposition so
therefore that's the one that we got to
increase consistent with the rest of the
relation between public policy and
public attitudes well tough love in this
sense is kind of like free markets free
markets have always meant pretty much
what they mean now it's always been it
you look through history it's been a
double-edged Doctrine what it means is
market discipline for some people poor
people for example but plenty of
protection for us for the rich people we
get state protection we get subsidy that
has always been the case it's the case
now that's one of the reasons why the
third world in the first world are so
different incidentally they were pretty
similar back in the 18th century and now
it's being brought home so yeah market
discipline for
mothers with children whose
seven-year-old kids have to learn
responsibility but no market discipline
for the corporate executives who have to
have public funds poured into their
pocket by various measures the Pentagon
system being the biggest of them well
this goes on and on and it's getting
late so I won't give any more details
that there are plenty and they're
interesting
but just to give an indication of how
far it's gone and why the art of satire
is unfortunately collapsing I let me
just end by quoting a recent article in
The Wall Street Journal my favorite
reading in fact a lot of good news
incidentally I like the business press
generally they had an article with the
headline congressional Republicans call
for defunding the left a couple of weeks
ago so they're tired of all this public
funds going into the pockets of radicals
well the story went on to say
Republicans take aim at left-leaning
groups that get federal grants for
assistance programs pretty bad stuff
well who are the left-leaning groups the
top one by far in the list was Catholic
Charities and if you look down at the
explanation the reason is that nuns and
priests many of whom work without pay
run programs to try to bring low in to
help low-income heating and to run Head
Start courses for Head Start programs
for poor people so that's Alessa
Catholic Charities for that reason is a
left-leaning group and we got a defund
this their radical agenda the next on
the list is the AARP American
Association of Retired people and the
reason why that radical group has to be
defunded they explain is that it has
programs sinks even this low it has
programs to help elderly Americans get
jobs remember that there's another Wall
Street Journal story which said one out
of six of those elderly Americans is
suffering from malnutrition and many of
them are in there
literally starving but if somebody wants
to try to help them get jobs we've got
to fund these dangerous radicals and it
goes on like that in fact you get a
pretty clear sense of who the left is
the left anybody who has any interest in
helping human beings belongs to the left
and has to be stopped instantly for
people who consider themselves as being
on the left that's not only pretty
flattering but also kind of encouraging
because it means that the left is a vast
array of people in fact which is not
totally untrue if you look at public
attitudes it's virtually everybody
anyone who cares about human beings has
to be stopped because the goal is to
turn the country into something that
looks like the third world with the
minority the opulent well protected
plenty of state subsidies Heritage
Foundation's want to make sure that so
they can be you know big entrepreneurs
like the CEOs of Lockheed Martin and the
rest of Cobb County but the rest of the
population gets the tough part of tough
love well these things are not laws of
nature plainly they are human decisions
they're being made within human
institutions been done before it's been
combated before it's been successfully
combated before I gave a couple of
examples before and there are many
others it's never been easy to try to
defend and struggle for human rights and
freedom and democracy and justice has
never been impossible it's not easy now
and it's not impossible now and I think
there has rarely been a moment in
history when that choice has carried
such enormous human consequences
