none of this was known at the time
like nothing about it when I was a
teenager growing up but in fact only in
recent years it's been revealed that
incidentally it wasn't a big secret well
if you read Adam Smith he bitterly
condemns British policies in India
he argued that according to his version
of economic theory everyone should gain
by the free interaction of the imperial
powers and the colonies but he says
because of what he called the savage
injustice of the Europeans meaning
primarily the British this didn't happen
and they were ruined and destroyed he
was particularly bitter about Britain's
imposition of famine and India this is
back in seventeen mid 18th centuries and
the British policies at India phrase was
I think converted derth to famine by
forcing the farmers to produce say you
know opium for export as the early days
it was much worse later rather than food
for people and the result was you know
severe destruction and hunger and so on
so even even than it was it was
information about it but the scale and
character of it has only really been
learned over the years from more recent
scholarship India and a lot of its in a
lot of this comes out of Indian
scholarship but now it's penetrating
into Western scholarship so if you go
back to your question what did I know in
the 1930s and 40s well I know that
imperialism was pretty rotten and harm
people but the extent didn't character
of it was very much concealed and of
course in djenne this wasn't the general
picture the general picture is that
the Imperial Europe is bringing
enlightenment and civilization to the
backward natives it's pretty striking to
see how leading and lightened figures
treated this like take say John Stuart
Mill quite remarkable if you read him is
he has a classic essay it's taught in
law schools to this day on intervention
it's one of the classic essays on you
know intervention and it's it's treated
as if it's critical of intervention so
it's regarded as one of the early
critical classics however if you read it
it's quite different what he does what
he does this is John Stuart Mill I'm
talking about not somebody some guy way
off on the you know right-wing
flag-waving he says he says what we have
to be really careful of that
intervention and the reason is that
Britain is a kind of an angelic society
it's not like the rest of the world it's
unique and its magnificence and the high
high values and so on and in fact we're
so magnificent that people try to the
Europeans thinking English people the
continental Europe to try to attribute
to us evil motives because they can't
believe that anybody could be this
magnificent so when we consider
intervention we have to recognize that
even though we're always doing it for
the most uplifting benign motives we're
going to be subjected to publicly and
condemnation law while Europeans try to
pollute young a tribute to us all sort
of evil intentions and then he turns to
India this was an 1859 I guess right
after the what they call the Indian
Mutiny that is the uprising which was
put down with extreme brutality and it
was known in England there were
parliamentary inquiries you know it was
no secret that there was horrible
brutality and putting it down
and that's the context in which mill was
writing he says well we have to consider
intervention in India of course we're
doing it for the benefit of the natives
but and maybe they understand it but is
it in the case of barbarians you just
can't pay attention to what they think
because they don't understand so we have
to intervene for their benefit and
uplift them and civilize them and so on
even though we're going to be condemned
by the Europeans for our bad motives and
the war barians won't understand why
we're doing this for them that's John
Stuart Mill you know kind of the peak of
British enlightenment and alone the
others you know so in fact what England
was doing as he had to know he was he
was an official of the East India
Company final secretary or something so
he knew what was going on this is after
the first opium war and at the beginning
of the Second Opium War which was
utterly vicious I mean what Britain was
doing was they wanted to conquer most of
India so they could try to gain a
monopoly of opium and they needed opium
to break into the Chinese market the
Chinese didn't want British goods they
said their own goods are better we don't
want too important Lancaster and the
only way you could break that down this
is the period of a lot of talk about
free trade you know wonderful it is the
only way you could open the Chinese
market was to send gunboats and and
smash smash Chinese resistance and force
on them something that the leadership
wanted to keep out opium so if we can
dope up the population with Indian opium
then we can have will force our goods on
them and we'll get what we want from
them that's the enlightened period of
British imperialism and India suffered
from it because it was being conquered
to try to gain monopoly of opium didn't
quite make it there were American
merchants in there
my to get a piece of the opium trade and
so on but it's not a very pretty story
all around but again none of this was
known really until fairly recent
scholarship
so like around the same time or maybe a
little later in your career like to the
50s you were also revolutionizing the
field of linguistics by giving at the
cognitive orientation and you mentioned
in the past that the models that you
proposed for the study of natural
language syntax had have close parallels
with those proposed by the Indian
variants portion scripted like
particularly the notion of production
rule and the generative aspect of the
grammar is somewhat similar to what
planet-- had done for Nelson Street it's
interesting I didn't know anything about
this so one that's which is kind of
striking because one of the people I was
studying with was an excellent scholar
whose background was in index
scholarship and he knew all of this and
I was an undergraduate kind of making it
up no but he never pointed out to me
that there's a tradition and I think the
reason is because the tradition was
considered exotic and insignificant we
don't study that kind of stuff we were
modern we inventing everything from
scratch you just look at structure
linguistics and nothing ever happened
before
we started working on it you know that
was the general attitude and if actually
look at the history of linguistics it's
it's pretty grotesque it's improved in
the last 20 or 30 years but at that time
was pretty awful if we viewed some of it
later
so I learned about it later and it was
even worse than that it turns out that
leonard bloomfield who was the leading
figure in american linguistics was a
complete schizophrenic he was a it was
very much influenced by the vienna
circle the logical positivism and
everything has to be done the way the
logical positivists do in read his book
language it ridicules the idea of
ordered rules or anything like that so
that was one part of his brain the other
part of his brain he was a scholar and
also knew the Germanic and also the
Indic tradition and when he ate some of
his actual work in particular a study of
an American Indian language called
Menominee when he worked on Menominee it
was on a pond Indian pattern but he
didn't publish it in the United States
he published it in Czechoslovakia but
that was not many year years before that
was 1939 I was student in 1946 not that
big got a 16 year old kid coming into
the field knowing nothing and was
starting to work and I was starting to
kind of reconstruct something like not
that dissimilar flint-like Bloomfield
had just done nobody pointed it out to
me everyone knew Bloomfield no not only
because he was the leading figure but
they know him personally and he
respected figure but not a single person
pointed out to me that what I was trying
to reinvent was pretty similar to what
Bloomfield had done a few years earlier
and had roots way back to classical
India again all of this stuff was
learned later it's very there were a lot
of interesting reasons for that partly
it was things that were happening in the
United States at the time if you look at
that whole period post-war period it was
a period of tremendous
self-congratulation in the United States
and contempt for Europe and for history
and they're interesting reasons that
hasn't really been studied because you
know history is written by intellectuals
and like to write about themselves but
if you look back at what happened it's
quite interesting before the Second
World War
the United States was an intellectual
backwater if you wanted to be a
physicist that you went to Germany you
want to be philosopher you go to England
do you want to be a creative writer you
go to Paris you know the United States
is kind of some rural backwater where
nothing happens so Europe was the
exciting place several were changed all
of that
Europe was devastated the United States
gained an enormous Lee from the war at
the end of the war the United States was
in a position of just overwhelming power
had literally half the world's wealth an
incredible security wartime the wartime
government programs research and
development programs had created a lot
of it very advanced technology by the
standards of the day so the and of
course the US Britain had a little of it
but Britain was smashed by the war the
Germany had quite a lot in fact they
were more advanced in the West but that
was all essentially either destroyed or
stolen a lot of German scientists
couldn't picture scientists were brought
here some were taken to Europe to Russia
you know they both reading it but they
had very advanced technology but that
all became US technology all of a sudden
we're not a backwater anymore we're the
center of the world and that shows up in
policy I mean you know we're elaborate
plans made to essentially rule the world
they were implemented but it also showed
up just culturally we are so full we're
so far ahead partly it's that week that
the US was indeed a more much more
advanced economically and
technologically but partly it was
psychological
we're not they're certain we're not we
don't have to go to them to study
anymore they have to come here because
we're the ones who understand everything
and do everything I mean at European
scholars well-known European scholars
were kept out of American universities
partly out of fear you know they were
just too good in what the competition
but part
of just contempt for everything a
European or in the past that's the
environment in which I went to school
this period of self-glorification and
euphoria and it runs right through the
1950s you see it all over the place but
when I was a student at Harvard in the
early 50s and everything is the biggest
psychology philosophy you know what
became the brain and cognitive sciences
later was just emerging it was all
strictly American didn't read anything
else there were a couple of us one was
my colleague in the next room oldest
friend and other Eric Leonard were three
graduate students who just didn't
believe that any of everything and by
ourselves we started just reading a
European biology ethology was into a
basically comparative biology Tinbergen
the lorentz people like that which was
considered just an acid I nobody talked
about it and we learned quite a lot you
know they didn't interesting important
work that's fed into our own efforts
mine and others to a sharp critique of
the whole behavioral science approach to
all these topics but it it broke sharply
with the kind of self congratulatory
period of the American science and
technology during those years and it was
partly based on reality like in the
sciences by the 1930s chemistry and
physics had been pretty much unified the
country was introduced to physics
contrary to what says on the contrary
physics changed radically and was able
to become unified with chemistry then
you go through the 40s in the early 50s
it looked as if biology could be unified
with chemistry so quick and Watson you
know Pauling and others and it looked as
if well the next now we've mastered
we've taken care of chemistry in physics
I mean some things to fix up but we
basically understand them the biology is
now incorporated into this unified
science quite an exaggeration
incidentally that that's the mood and
now we have to go on to the next
frontier next frontiers is the mind
intelligence cognition so you get the
beginnings of what in reaction to this
actually became cognitive science at
that point is behavioral science you
study behavior again they do it the
American Way and so on but that was
basically the atmosphere it was so
extreme that even well-known American
scientists were ignored a famous
neurologist who was in fact at Harvard
Karl Lashley around 1950 that published
this studies some studies of complex
behavior in their organization which
were a very sharp refutation of the
whole behavioral science approach and of
radical behaviorism and everything else
which was just a Dogma at Harvard I was
a student there at the time I never
heard that I learned about it later from
an art historian and then wrote about it
when I wrote about it in 1957 I think
that was the first time it had ever been
measured yeah and he was right at
Harvard on a but you know the insula the
insularity
and self confidence and arrogance of the
whole intellectual atmosphere was
astonishing and I think its roots were
partly just what I described now we're
on top but before we were we had to go
to them to learn things but no we read
everything so we'll do it our way
forget about the past and going back to
your point that I suspect is one of the
main reasons why I was ever even told
about the traditional origins from
people and do it good scholars knew it
but kind of repressed it because it was
considered kind of you know
insignificant or just some minor that
quirk that they happened to study this
stuff can't be of any interest
you
by now it's improved there are people
who that one person who you may know is
fritz tall who very smart guy it was
logician he studied linguistics studied
here for a while we were friends dieter
head but he kind of began to bring out
the Indian scientific tradition and the
work they did is pretty revealing I mean
I didn't know anything about it before
but he found that there were Indian
scientists in the medieval period and up
to the 14th century who were doing work
which was a kind of parallel to and
comparable to some of the early modern
develops early modern science I think
that mostly ended after the British
conquest the same in China you know
China and India were the industrial
commercial and intellectual centers of
the world and the 16th 17th century
Europe was a backwater I kind of like
the United States and the 30s so you
that was where if for everything from
industry culture but it was pretty much
crushed by the imperial conquest in
China led to what they call their
century of humiliation you know just
pulling out of it now and India was
largely marginalized complex like
Calcutta remained one of the
intellectual centers of in a way the
world that the West didn't know about it
bought a book publishing it rich
intellectual life but the British didn't
take it seriously you know was the
standard view was essentially Macaulay's
we have to civilize them or Mills you
know they're barbarians
what could they know
linguistics there is some discussion
the Indian tradition but there are other
fields like mathematics or metallurgy
where I mean the contributions of the
Indian tradition have been immense but
they are even today they're completely
unheard of like many people find it
surprising when they are told that the
decimal system originated from the work
of Magan never for that matter the error
the our contribution right by now it's
kind of known among specialists and of
course there's one dramatic exception to
that that's Ramanujan who was brought to
England by kind of an Indian Clerk you
know had amazing discoveries in number
theory and he was discovered by G H
Hardy was one of the leading British
mathematician he was brought to
Cambridge a very interesting history
actually what happened and but but he
became known but he was considered just
like some miracle worker you know kind
of off the planet which he was in some
ways yep
so I believe you've been to India a
couple of times in the past so have you
have you liked do you think that Indian
society is fundamentally different from
societies of industrialized and
developing nations in the West like the
we have the one thing that always comes
up for discussion is that we've always
had this decentralized systems both
politically and economically and and as
a consequence a lot of the diversity
still survives but at the same time the
flipside of this kind of system that
we've had is that it makes very
difficult for - for people to organize
and for people's movements to come about
so DLR was true in the West to remember
the imposition of the contemporary
nation-state system in Europe was the
result of centuries of murderous savage
conflict I mean the 30 Years War for
example 17th century it must have killed
maybe 40% of the population of Germany
and these were even right up till today
languages are disappearing very rapidly
in your associate say in Italy which is
you know one of the later developing
societies is plenty of people in Italy
you can't talk to the grandmothers
because they took a different language
it's all being unified and the state
system imposes a kind of a frame of
unity and a coordination that didn't
exist in societies at all in fact you
can see this is the European Union
introduces its centralizing tendencies
as a counter tendency of regionalization
so areas like Catalonia in vast country
Wales and others are reasserting their
individuality recovering their languages
their cultures one of them separate
becoming more autonomous or this mixed
picture and then in the United States a
different story the nicest exterminate
the population so of course it's uniform
you go from Boston to Los Angeles they
don't even though you're you know hey
you're left
but the settler colonial societies like
the offshoots of England like United
States Australia New Zealand to a large
extent Canada that it's different from
imperialism
they said the British imperialism and
India didn't wipe out the population of
the plenty of atrocities but they try to
replace the population they ruled over
them here in the settler colonial
societies population had to be as the
founding fathers actually put it
exterminated which is pretty much what
happened and this is instantly forgotten
so for example to this day literally you
could read in the most elevated left
liberal intellectual journals that there
wasn't any population here there was an
article in the New York Review New York
Review it's the leading you know kind of
left the left liberal intellectual
journal in the english-speaking world
about two years ago they had an article
in which somebody was reviewing books by
some historian and a well-known writer
much insane but in which he said that he
learned such amazing things he learned
that when Columbus reached the Western
Hemisphere there were only about a
million people in the hemisphere of
hunter-gatherers straggling around act
he's off by about 80 million or
and they had advanced civilizations and
big cities and and that's today yeah
actually I look to see if there's going
to be any letters respond commenting on
a single letter was published but they
must have the editors must have gotten
some criticism because about four months
later they published a small correction
which wasn't much of a correction in
fact almost as bad as the original but
this is the leading left kind of left
liberal intellectual journal in the
english-speaking world actually has a
kind of a sister Journal in England
London review which is even more to the
left about the same time they had a an
article which was not that bad but not
that great either it just referred to in
passing it referred to the Native
American population as being you know
treated harshly or something yeah like
exterminate but it's just not part of
Western consciousness that just is what
happened in India isn't in British
consciousness or what happened in
Ireland for that matter you know it
wasn't those eight hundred years of
really vicious oppression of the Irish
remember ember once traveling through
Ireland I went from Dublin devel fest
with some civil rights activists in
Belfast we were taken to my wife and I
to a farm in southern southern part of
Northern Ireland and ARMA some South
Armagh and that meta farmer we were
introduced in because his son had just
been murdered by the British that was a
big issue he took us around his farm and
yeah probably every stone he described
to me at what cromwell's Army had done
there in the 1640s you know they don't
forget but that's the victims the
victors don't remember and I think
that's you find that all over the world
that you want to learn about Native
American history here you read
studies done by Native Americans I mean
by now some others but that's where the
memories are and I'm sure you find that
just everywhere and then my first visit
to India was in 1972 I was it was fun
invited by the government actually it
was neighbor memorial lectures and it
was pretty weird
at the same interesting very interesting
but pretty strange for one thing I had
an enormous amount of protection and I
couldn't walk out of the hotel without
some guy it wasn't it uniform but he
mustered in some high-level police
officer taking me into the car and I
know he was an important every time we
passed a traffic signal he'd make some
gesture to the policeman there and they
let the car go but I remember one
striking experience actually I went with
Indira Gandhi who had spent some time
with I went with her to an Asian fair
that was going on I had more protection
than she had you know and the one one of
the squares in downtown New Delhi I
forget which one it was there were about
forty thousand squatters there and I
drove by one morning and there was
nobody there and I asked what happened
and they said well they were trucked
into the country dumped out in the
country somewhere because they had to
make the place look prettier for the
Asian fair that was coming nobody seemed
to have a kind of a second thought about
it yeah that's what and incidentally I I
asked at one point why I was getting so
much protection and I was told that they
looked up my biography and found that
I'm Jewish and they thought I might be a
target for PLO terrorists tried to
explain to them more likely to be a
target for the Mossad but I think it's
really this happened again just a couple
of years ago when I was
I spent my wife and I spent three weeks
in Indiana's peril
around in Kerala I had given I get a lot
of talks when one of them and the
question period something came up with
that Kashmir and I said something about
Indian atrocities in Kashmir you know
something that everybody ought to know
it's writing the major report that the
next day there was a BJP demonstration
outside of another talk and the people
who were with me were very worried about
that and the rest of the time I was in
India I had police protection all time
which I totally ridiculous my opinion
but that's what they thought you know
but I'm at the striking thing about
India it's a fascinating country but the
thing that you just can't miss is the
absolutely hideous pottery I mean it
can't walk down the streets of you know
New Delhi without seeing it let alone
four places you know but people don't
see it you know it's pretty striking to
me actually I once drove through Delhi
ordered delivery there with a very
impressive woman she was a woman I will
mention her name who it had been a
professor at JNU sociologist and she
quit to go live in Rajasthan in a very
poor village where she was working on
women's issues you know for 17 years I
think living in a hut it's almost a
really dedicated person we happen to be
driving together in Delhi we were going
to a demonstration where we're each
going to speak and I noticed that she
never looked at the window but you know
what it's like kind of nice
you stop at a street corner miserable
people and I asked her you know how do
you live with this stuff I said the only
way to live with it is not the look you
know if you look you said devastated you
can't survive but I think people somehow
internalized it the shining in the
crowd I don't think they've seen what's
going on and it's right in front of you
you know a little on the Bombay slums
and we were just incredible but I went
from India to Pakistan my wife and I and
you know Pakistan's not an ideal society
by any means but I didn't notice a
difference like in Calcutta when we went
to the markets and so on you know you're
just being dragged into stores by people
trying to force something on you a
miserable poverty everywhere when we
went to the same places in Lahore it was
just like going through a market that's
the poverty and misery and it shows up
in the statistics I think there's an
interesting studies which are never
discussed and I March SN you know great
specialist in famine and the Chandra is
an economist at JNU they did some
comparative studies of India and China
from liberation up till 1979 when the
Chinese reforms started so their studies
stopped but basically the Maoist period
and that includes the huge Chinese
famine which they discuss you know they
compared the two countries during that
period and they say yeah the Chinese
famine was big described as a political
famine not because anyone wanted it to
happen but for their sends usual reasons
the the totalitarian system in China the
information just never reached the
center they didn't know what was
happening by the time they found out it
was much too late to do anything and
they point out that in relatively
democratic India that hasn't happened so
after the bridge were kicked out there
weren't any more famines were always
able to adapt that as they put it
India put as many skeletons and it
closet every eight years as China did
during its years of shame you know the
famine years one hundred million people
over this 30 year period that's quitting
and this is democratic capitalism so
that just can't be reported I mean
literally in the same articles can't be
seen it's active when Sen got a Nobel
Prize I a a lot of interviews about it
and I kept bringing this up and the only
reporter who was willing to report it
was an Indian reporter I don't remember
his name but he picked it up and
reported it and I think that's you know
that's shining India in it and changed a
lot some of the numbers are certain may
be different but structurally it's I'm
by now there's a lot of wealthy people
but yeah but there's many more who are
just living in misery I mean I'm sure
you know the facts better than I do but
even food intake has declined since the
reforms average caloric intake so we're
come this way you know what it's up
night economist at JNU and others so
it's a and nothing's being done about it
I mean they're just being totally
marginalized yeah on the other hand it's
a remarkable country up anyways if he
cannot look out the window so what hope
do you see for people's movements to do
I mean for people to organize themselves
and and come up and try to find
solutions for these problems in a
society such as India what hope do you
see for people to organize there's a lot
of vibrancy and excitement in the
society is a plenty of things to be done
and there are people who work hard on
these things
somebody like Arundhati Roy for example
is very wonderful woman very courageous
and then you know then she went out into
the forests where the tribal people are
basically being annihilated in the area
opened up for destruction for commercial
interests and people didn't like what
she wrote you know she was in fact that
you know death threats condemnation
Zorin but she keeps going and then there
are some critics good critics who say
that she kind of tended to glorify the
now still limit okay maybe I don't know
she was mostly writing about the people
and I think that's and there's a lot
that can be done now there are plenty of
like this woman who I mentioned who live
in Rajasthan there plenty of dedicated
people really working on these things
might as well tell you her name her
name's a row right here we probably tup
so before we finish one last question -
we live with this winter Hindu concept
of Avatar with the Hindu concept of
avatar as this expression of cosmic
intelligence in human from form which
happens from time to time in order to
restore balance between the elements I'm
not familiar with that have you
considered that that definition applies
very well to you I'm a very ordinary
person nothing special
really
you
