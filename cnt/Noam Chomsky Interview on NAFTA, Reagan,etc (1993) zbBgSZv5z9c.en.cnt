next on c-span a live discussion with
Noam Chomsky professor of linguistics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professor Chomsky is expected
to talk about his views on American
politics and policy
noam chomsky professor of linguistics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology this evening of Washington
speaking to a group they've asked you to
come talk about the implications and
consequences of the Clinton
administration's foreign policy House
Bill Clinton done first year in foreign
policy I think about as expected I
actually wrote an article last December
about it my view is that he was exactly
the way he presented himself candidate
of big business new democrat free from
the old liberal cliches about
entitlements and rights and so on
committed to improving the business
climate to engaging the government more
in supporting the wealthy the kind of
thing he'd done in Arkansas and I think
that the both the formulation of the
policy which came in late September
there was a series of speeches in which
the Clinton vision as they were calling
it was formulated and then the
achievements of the policy which are
essentially the November achievements
NAFTA the the Asian Pacific Council
summit associated domestic programs that
reflects his achievement in supporting
the concerns and interests of major
American corporations it explains why
the Wall Street Journal for example was
so enthusiastic about him describing him
as a continuing with what has been a
pattern of Democratic presidents who
link up very closely to interest of big
business rather than a small business
whereas the Republicans in contrast tend
to be the party of the business
community generally so somewhat
different and I think that's pretty much
what we're finding and we will continue
to find I think with the health plan and
so on on the other hand other foreign
policy issues such as you know I'm say
helping restore democracy in Haiti and
so on I mean I never expected any
possibility that and don't see any if if
you mentioned some of those the foreign
policy achievements go back and talk a
little bit more detail you mentioned
NAFTA
right off to bat go into that little
further about the impact naft is going
to have well there's a good deal of the
issue that was discussed like will there
be more jobs or less jobs
there's nobody has any idea none of the
economic models that are being used
they're so remote from reality that what
they say is almost meaningless and
that's pointed out a long time ago the
congressional office of Technology
Assessment did an analysis of this
executive version of NAFTA about a year
ago and made that point among others
however there are some consequences
about which there's pretty general
agreement then if you read the text and
you see the international forces at work
you can understand why it is going to
have the effect of deepening the split
between the the wealthy and the general
population inequality has been growing
in the country for about 30 years real
wages have been declining growth has
been quite slow such wealth has been
created is going increasingly to a small
sector of the wealthy the country is
kind of taking on a sort of a third
world look I mean it's not Brazil or
Mexico but if you walk through the
streets of any major city say Washington
or New York or whatever you see what the
statistics tell you that there's a large
relatively marginalized population
developing superfluous for wealth
production because increasingly
transnational corporations are able to
shift production to high repression low
wage areas elsewhere and wages will go
down in fact they're going down
internationally because these things all
interact so as American way of the u.s.
wages are now the lowest in the
industrial world outside of Britain
that's a big change over the last ten
years in fact a complete reversal and
that means that say German factories
will invest in Alabama as they're now
doing because they can get much cheaper
an order request labor so it brings down
German wages the so what is it
anticipated from NAFTA I think almost
across the board
a lowering of the income of a
substantial part of the population
probably a majority an increase in
wealth for privileged sectors and what
that will mean overall in the statistics
is not so certain so let me give you one
one analysis which is highly regarded
and taken actually here in the
Washington Post is by a UCLA professor
of management Edward leemer who's prone
after I believe and he estimated that by
the end of the decade if NAFTA goes
through in the present form the form
that it did go through there would be an
increase his estimate was of about three
thousand dollars a year in income for
professionals and people associated with
the higher levels of the business
community managerial skilled labor
executives and so on about three
thousand dollars a year increase in
income for them about a seven hundred
and fifty dollar a year decline in
income for most of the workforce and he
figured that would average out to about
a two hundred dollar a year decline for
the general population and mice I
believe he's Pro NAFTA and most of the
economists were pro enough to say
something similar so my colleague Paul
Krugman of MIT is a international trade
specialist who's very Pro NAFTA does
agree that for unskilled labor there
will be a decline in income unskilled
labor happens to be 70 percent of the
workforce there was an analysis in New
York Times the day after the NAFTA vote
they delayed it it's the first analysis
of the regional impact of NAFTA
predicted regional impact in the New
York area and it was exactly the same
there's a banking corporate law firms
pharmaceutical corporations of the
publishing industry chemical industry
which is highly capital intensive not
many workers corporate law firms then
they said there will be some losers the
losers will be women blacks Hispanics
semi skilled labor that's about
three-quarters of the workforce and the
effect will be to split to increase
intensify
the move that is very clear towards
separating the society into two tiers in
the long term it means sort of
internationalizing the third world model
that's the typical third world country
say Mexico you know small sector of very
wealthy people usually connected to
international investment and finance and
transnationals and so on and a very
large sector of extremely poor people
and instantly nafta's expected to have
the same effect in Mexico so the leading
Mexican financial journal which is very
Pro NAFTA estimated that about 25
percent of Mexican manufacturing
industry would be destroyed in the first
two years and about fourteen percent of
the workforce would be eliminated
another effect of NAFTA which everyone
expects is that cheap US agribusiness
exports will contribute to the process
oil already going on of driving out
large numbers of peasant producers all
of this swells the workforce swelling
the workforce drives down income there
is no serious opportunity for organizing
it's pretty repressive and brutal so
that'll have the effect of lowering
wages there just as a lot of the effect
of lowering wages here and this if you
look at the international system this is
a continuing drag any country that's
providing more where workers have
achieved more rights say rights to hold
job security or pension rights or
whatever it's naturally going to be
driven down as international capital can
seek the point of highest repression and
lowest wages so where you move towards
an international economy of essentially
low growth low wages and very high
profits and that's a kind of
internationalization of the third world
model and this particular version of
NAFTA was is very likely to have that
consequence know you know it should not
be called a free trade agreement because
it is not it is a highly protectionist
agreement with a complex mixture of
liberalisation and protection designed
to guarantee investor rights investor
very delicately protected worker rights
community rights and so on are undercut
in fact one consequence of it is to
attack democratic institutions as a mr.
yeah it places decision-making power in
the hands of unaccountable structures
which are transnational if there's a
conflict let's say between some local or
regional decision on Environmental
Protection or pesticides or whatever and
in a transnational corporation that will
ultimately find its way to an
adjudication panel which operates in
secret we just made up mainly of
corporate lawyers and so on and is out
of public control all of these systems
reduce the role and effectiveness of
parliamentary institutions and unions
and other popular groups and increase
the decision-making power of investors
and transnational corporations and big
banks and so on and that's what they're
intended to do good afternoon and
welcome to a special LIVE viewer calling
program on this Friday afternoon our
guest for about the next 35 minutes now
Noam Chomsky professor of linguistics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology you've seen the numbers at
the bottom of the screen and we ask if
you've called in the past 30 days to
wait so that others can get in with
their calls a little bit more easily
first call us from Royal Oak Michigan
good afternoon you started talking about
NAFTA and you got me thinking about my
my first objection to it was just the
fact that it was like 2,000 pages and
you know it's like you don't you don't
really understand it and you think
they're trying to fool you with
something
and I was wondering how long did bills
used to be like a hundred years ago and
do you think that you know it would be
possible for them ever to just see all
future bills you should be less than ten
times the length of the US Constitution
well you're quite right about the not
only the length of this but if you do
have a look at it you'll find that it's
also unreadable I mean it's it's very
hard going and recall that this was it
was intended that this would be rammed
through in secret
if you look at what happened the
agreement was signed by the three
executives of Canada United States and
Mexico in mid-august 1992 I think was
August 12th or so 1992 remember that was
right in the middle of a presidential
campaign whatever one thinks of attitude
towards naff that's obvious has a big
effect on American life try to look back
and find out what anybody said about it
nobody was very little discussed in fact
probably wouldn't been mentioned at all
of Peru hadn't brought it up nobody knew
about it nobody knew what was going on
according to US trade law there's a 1974
congressional legislation which requires
that any trade related instrument any
law or whatever involving trade must be
submitted to the labor advisory
committee group based in unions as for
advice and consultation and analysis
that's the one popular input to trade
legislation it was not given to them
they were in fact informed that their
reaction to NAFTA was do you know I
would say September 15th or whatever the
date was some date around then and they
were actually given the text of this
2,000 page document on readable document
24 hours before the due date that was to
ensure that they couldn't even formally
convene all of this incidentally was
oppressed in the press nobody talked
about it the labor Advisory Committee
did write a very detailed and rather
interesting analysis and they were very
bitter about this and pointed out that
even the procedure was a major attack on
democracy the intention was that all
this would go through Congress was on a
fast-track they weren't going to pay any
attention to it
and nobody would know there was enough
popular opposition that developed for
all sorts of reasons so that it had to
become a public issue but it was not
intended to be it was intended to be you
can see by just what I described it was
intended to be driven home in secret and
then just sort of sitting there locking
into place particular arrangements and
particulars of the powerful and as I
mentioned it itself is quite
anti-democratic in its essential nature
so your your
your reaction to the length of the text
and furthermore the complexity the text
is quite accurate and when we fill out
more details we see that that's a large
part of it in fact I think it should
many the major impact of these of these
developments including yet may well be
to undermine democratic structures and
to transfer power to private private
power essentially private transnational
institutions and recall that a
corporation is essentially free from
public control and when it becomes
transnational even the limited control
that comes from national legislation
declines you are a professor of
linguistics
what is linguistics and and what's of
two parts and what's the significance of
its study well there's a lot of covers a
lot of territory but the kind of
linguistics that we do is an effort to
find out the basic principles of a
certain part of human cognitive nature
what is it that enables us to to do what
you and I are doing what special thing
is it about our brains as distinct from
other organisms that enables these
extremely complex systems of Arctic of
creation and articulation of thought and
interaction first of all to develop why
do they have the forms they do what are
the principles they operate under what
aspects of them are universal just
rooted in our genes basically which
turns out to be most of them and what
does this tell us about the nature of
the human mind I mean that's essentially
the topic Cherry Hill New Jersey good
afternoon
stop dissecting every part of the United
States in the world why don't we go to a
25-pound where we work and we could all
go out and smell the roses what's so bad
about that
well actually proposals of that kind
were made by not for twenty five hours
but I think 36 hours or something by the
union's years ago and that's very it's
very interesting question remember the
fight for a 40-hour week was a huge
battle it took
well about 70 or 80 years of a very
bitter strife and in the United States
very violent strife I should say I think
about 700 workers were killed by
security forces during that period
simply to obtain the 40-hour week and
shortly after that victory was attained
that started being lost so the 40-hour
week is now a thing of the past the
average work week has been increasing
through a variety of mechanisms since
that victory was won the question of
whether there should be a lower workweek
is it should be you know in my opinion
at least I mean here values come in but
in my opinion it should be basically a
matter of a necrotic decision but of
course for it to be a matter of
democratic decision that means that
corporate power has to be under
Democratic control if the decisions are
made by private power unaccountable
private power they are naturally going
to try to drive their workforce down to
the lowest possible level and get the
maximum out of them and if that comes
from having 60 hour weeks dry for that
Garden Grove California good afternoon I
wanted to ask mr. Chomsky if he believes
that there are no changes made and the
way we trade and operate internationally
whether this wouldn't in the long run
reduce the world to global serfdom and
then it seems were right back to where
communism came in in the first place if
people cannot survive they're going to
repeal and here we spent 40 or 50 years
fighting communism and we seem to be
moving in to the direction where we're
going to get it back thanks for the call
well there's a lot to say about what we
call fighting communism for one thing
there's no plausible sense of the word
in which the Soviet Union was communist
or socialist or anything like that it
was at the talat Aryan state which was
from its origins radically opposed to
any element of the traditional socialist
vision but whatever it was this was a
big part of the traditional third world
which is essentially what Russia and a
spirit were with the Europe's third
world had been for
years which went off in a course of
independent development which we call
communism and they called communism that
we don't allow parts of the third world
to escape from their service rule it
doesn't matter whether they're little
ones or big ones and that led to a big
conflict they are now back in the third
world that's what losing the Cold War
means and I don't think it's I mean the
the revolutionary changes that took
place in Russia were indeed a reaction
to their deeply impoverished third world
conditions they had nothing to do with
socialism or anything like that but
that's what they were you're right our
effort to destroy it was not an attempt
to to improve economic conditions in
fact take a look at the parts of the
third world that we do control that
takes a Brazil you know huge rich
country with enormous resources which
we've been had a big strong hand and
running since 1945 and take a look at it
that's what we've been trying to create
in the third world it's a country with a
sector and five or ten percent of the
population of great wealth the average
level of the country is about at the
level of Albania or Paraguay then maybe
75 percent of the population lives in
utter misery and this is in a country
with an enormous advantages no enemies
tremendous resources of a lot of US aid
and in fact US tutelage since 1945 and
my suspicion is that's what much of
Eastern Europe will come to look like
but you're right about the the
tendencies that now exist are polar or
polarizing tendencies much of the world
indeed most of the world is the society
is becoming polarized on an
international scale with the there's low
growth in most places there's increasing
wealth but in very small sectors and
substantial parts of the population are
declining they have to be controlled by
force in my opinion it's kind of
symbolic that the anti-crime bill passed
a couple of days after NAFTA passed
I mean after NAFTA it's going to have I
think it's fairly clear this polarizing
effect meaning more people more social
disintegration
meaning more crime meaning more force
because unless something constructive is
done to reconstruct society you just
gonna control people by force and will
it ultimately lead to rebellion or I
think it probably will I mean in South
Central Los Angeles is a case I wouldn't
call it a rebellion it's a break out of
some kind but it's a response to and
these are takes a South Central Los
Angeles I mean these are regions where
there were jobs at one point there was
industry when that disappears you get
social disintegration which can take all
kind of forms I mean abuse and families
for example alcoholism random violence
and it could take a lot of forms it
could possibly take constructive forms
and I very much hope it will and those
constructive forms all of the efforts to
reverse these tendencies which are
deeply rooted in the international
economy Lagrange Indiana Purdue
University and I would just like you to
know that you've been an inspiration to
me academically my question is how would
you like to see President Clinton
respond to the growing nuclear threat of
North Korea I would like to see serious
efforts against proliferation and
looking at North Korea alone does not
really respond to that issue first of
all the question of North Korea and is
in a broader context but bear in mind
that while Clinton is talking about the
threat of nuclear proliferation in North
Korea he's also contributing to nuclear
proliferation so one of his grand
achievements at the asia-pacific summit
was to override congressional
restrictions on sale of high technology
equipment to China now those
restrictions were imposed by Congress
when Congress was given what they
considered conclusive evidence that
China was involved in missile
proliferation possibly involving North
Korea incidentally and possibly also
nuclear proliferation and if you look at
Clinton's summit decision it was to give
them supercomputers which is Pentagon
analysts quickly pointed out can be used
for missile development and nuclear
development and also to allow US exports
for
nuclear power generation now nuclear
power generation the nuclear weapons
production are very close and since
China has we can believe us intelligent
been engaged in proliferation
essentially Nixon was Clinton was saying
that I don't care about proliferation
what I care about is profit for us
corporations there are other cases too I
mean one of the major nuclear powers
aside from the really big ones is the
State of Israel which is the CIA pointed
out decades ago has hundreds of nuclear
weapons well you know it's nuclear
capacity is as an element in in the
world which has a lot of people
frightened I don't see any concern about
that when you turn to North Korea I
think the problem is real and I think
it's a problem of how North Korea is to
be integrated into a world system in in
under conditions in which it is at the
moment pretty desperate and pretty
unstable and that issue goes beyond
nuclear weapons it looks to me as though
North Korea is kind of desperately
trying to trade some form of potential
or maybe actual nuclear weapons
development against a form of acceptance
into the international system and I
think that's the direction that should
be pursued the last call would say a
student what kind of a teaching mode do
you still carry regular teaching Lewin
at a place like I teach my graduate
school so it means well I don't know
maybe several hours a week of actual and
lecturing and many hours a week of
person-to-person interaction with
students Plus and you've been teaching
for how many years
Mitzi's 38 years I guess after nearly 40
years what do you still like about the
classroom it's really exciting I mean
the there's nothing more exciting than
the intellectual interchange
the interaction with students whether
it's in children at one time in my life
actually taught children not teaching
advanced graduate students and it's
always an exciting experience or can be
McLean Virginia good afternoon good
afternoon dr. Chomsky two questions
number one have you written another book
in deterring democracy or do you have
another one in the works yeah well let
me see if they can remember I'll list
them for you really fast
year 501 rethinking Camelot chronicles
of dissent letters from Lexington and
prosperous few and the Restless many or
what come to mind there they're hard to
find
well they're usually not on the Shelf
per se where you have to special order
them in terms of being able to get them
I'd you know I don't like to wait around
for things to come in I just like to see
what's on the shelf and they're not
they're a little bit on the scare side
you'd so it's hard to know about them
and they're usually posed by small
presses which don't have the resources
to advertise okay one other quick second
question in terms of looking at the mass
media these days you don't really see
much contrary opinion real contrary
opinion when you're looking at the major
media and it's good to see that at least
you get out every once in a while I
caught you on Posner and Donahue a while
ago and what what do you think in terms
of getting more dissent in terms of real
contrary pain into the media do you
think that'll be happening or how does
that work
I wouldn't think it it's not on its own
it won't happen I mean the media are
basically huge corporations which sell
audiences to advertisers and they're
gonna reflect the interest of their
owners and their buyers by and large
however as popular pressures develop you
know as popular organization takes place
and in it popular involvement in the
political system and in social change
and so on the medial respond to it I
think you're quite right that there's
more openings now than there were say 30
years ago at least I experienced that to
a limited extent and I think it's just a
result of the changes that have taken
place in the country I'm
it's a more active lively vibrant
society than it was 30 years ago and
this is reflected in the media to some
extent while you're but why are your
books are defined
they say unpopular things so the of what
one book of mine happens to be on the US
media it was a best-seller in Canada it
was literally a best-seller
it was based on lectures given over
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation I
don't think it has a single review in
the United States why should American
media want to publicize a critical
analysis of the American media San
Francisco good afternoon
yes hi professor Chomsky I want to let
you know that I was at the premiere of
your documentary about you and premiered
here in San Francisco and I thoroughly
the new order my question for you is now
that the historians are starting to
speak about the 80s and the Ronald
Reagan presidency I'm not too interested
in you know what you feel about Ronald
Reagan more what would you feel the
continued effects as we head into the
next century are going to be and maybe
speak to the conditions that brought
this about
well the Reagan II I think you're right
in putting Reagan aside I don't think I
think he was mostly a symbolic figure
probably didn't even know what policy
was most of the time but the the
policies that developed and occur in the
Reagan years were in fact continuations
of the late Carter years so if you look
at the last few years of the Carter
Administration Carter introduced called
for vast expansion of the military
budget and cutback of social programs
though he didn't have quite the
political clout to push that through but
the Reaganites pushed it through and in
fact the military programs of the Reagan
years are not all that different from
the projections of the Carter years same
with the cutback of social programs and
this goes back to things that happened
in the early seventies and when there
were big changes that took place in the
International System one of them was
that Richard Nixon dismantled the
Bretton Woods system the system of that
developed after the Second World War of
international sort of capital regulation
in which the US was in effect the World
Bank er
that said that was one of a number of
factors that said into in motion a
substantially in fact huge growth of
speculative capital and the world of
accelerated the internationalization of
production meaning you know shifting of
production abroad and that sort of thing
and so a lot of other forces in motion
this meant a sharp attack it meant lower
growth sharp attack on welfare and
living standards and wages wages have
been real wages in the United States
have been declining since about that
time in fact and the Reagan years simply
extended and accelerated these
differences so the Reagan years were
years of substantial polarization maybe
70% of the population it's actual
absolute wealth declined in the Reagan
years whereas for the top few percent
they became greatly enriched and this
just is a continuation and indeed
acceleration of the kind of processes
we've been talking about and unless
there's there also going on in the
Clinton years and unless we the
population does something about them
they're gonna continue Syracuse dr.
Chomsky yeah I admire your work
studied it here at Syracuse University I
was wondering how you feel
NAFTA will affect third world countries
particularly countries in Central
America spoke earlier on third world
economies well of course the Central
American countries technically already
in NAFTA but the and it's a little hard
to predict there was a what was called a
Caribbean Basin initiative which was
going to include the Central American
countries and the Caribbean countries
and that was the policies of the central
of the Caribbean Basin initiative were
what are called liberalization I mean
those countries are to open themselves
up to market forces now that has a
general and NAFTA will probably in the
long term contribute to opening up
third-world countries to market forces
now there are a lot of rich countries
don't allow themselves to be open to
market forces so the United States is
highly protectionist
all sorts of systems for a massive state
intervention in the economy and it
always has every successful developed
country relied from England up till you
know South Korea and Taiwan relied on
including us it relied on radical
intervention state intervention to
protect economic power from market
forces and it continues until this day
the Pentagon system for example
economically speaking it's just a funnel
by which the general public subsidizes
high-tech industry which is of course a
radical violation of market principles
however the third world's to be deprived
of those mechanisms so that it will in
fact be a kind of service area and the
effect of these programs there have now
been so-called structural adjustment
programs there have been well over
seventy five and then I've forgotten how
many exactly the general effect that
they have is to lower Labor's share of
national income that's the overriding
effect I mean then what happens you know
dependence in one place to another but
they themselves have this polarizing
effect and that's the way market forces
work we have here a mixture of market
forces and state intervention and the
state intervention is for the benefit of
the wealthy in fact you want to know how
it works have a look at Clinton's great
triumph in Seattle the this sort of
centerpiece which got so much hoopla was
a speech that he gave in which he
announced his vision for the few free
market future in the Pacific and he
picked a model company which he called a
model for what other American
corporations should do and in fact gave
the speech and in a building of that
model company a hangar of the Boeing
Corporation that was the model for the
free market future Boeing is a publicly
subsidized corporation Boeing relies
extensively even for its existence on
the Pentagon if it wasn't for the
Pentagon funnel Boeing would not be the
country's major exporter and frankly
wouldn't be functioning and the same is
true of the aeronautical industry
altogether the same is true of
the other we mentioned Cray
supercomputers would you know being
given to China why decree supercomputers
exist because the public paid the costs
of research and development for
computers and in fact provided
substantial part of the market through
the whole Pentagon system the Pentagon
NASA and so on these are the kinds of
interventions in market processes that
benefit a certain sector of the economy
the more skilled professional investors
top managers and so on as far as Central
America is concerned though they're
gonna be subjected to market forces in
fact we've done this Costa Rica in
Central America was the one exception to
the Central American model of almost
total social disaster remember this is
the region of the world where we have
had the most influence we take a look at
Central America we learn a lot about
ourselves that's where we've had
enormous influence because of proximity
for a long long time there was one
exception to the disaster that the
harder' chamber that's most of the
region namely Costa Rica which for
various reasons had developed the kind
of Western European sort of Social
Democratic character and was a much
richer country than the rest well you
know during the Reagan years there was a
pretty harsh attack on that Costa Rica's
there was a lot of pressure on Costa
Rica to abandon its social programs to
cut back on domestic investment to open
itself up to market forces in fact to
become very much like the other
countries of the region and it largely
succeeded the United States a pretty
powerful country especially relative to
Central American countries so the fate
for Central America and NAFTA are no
NAFTA in my opinion is unless again
unless we there's nothing about it
because they're not powerful enough to
do it themselves is to become
essentially export platforms for
American industry which will use
extremely cheap and repressed labor for
profits here and the elimination of jobs
here Gainesville Florida good afternoon
professor thanks for your recent visit
here to the University of Florida I'm a
student in philosophy down here I
appreciate your talking
especially appreciated the comment about
the Florida State University mascot I
thought that was appropriate my question
is this certainly we expect each
individual to make up their own mind
about issues and not make up their mind
based on their political affiliation but
what was unique to NAFTA that allowed
for individuals like say yourself and
Pat Buchanan or say Bob Dole and Bill
Clinton normally on other sides of the
political aisle to hop into bed together
so to speak well math there was an
interesting issue I mean it was it was a
very overwhelmingly it was a class issue
in fact the New York Times even
permitted itself the unusual phrase
class lines was rarely a term which
rarely appears in the media because it's
a little too revealing
but they did point out that the attitude
toward NAFTA by and large broke down on
class lines corporate power was
overwhelmingly for it business and
corporate power was overwhelmingly for
it the workforce was overwhelmingly
against it the media were overwhelmingly
for it that they automatic almost
automatically respond to corporate
interests that despite the enormous
media barrage virtually 100% approval
the general population remained somewhat
against it so the latest polls I saw I
think in september/october showed about
of the portion of the population that
had an opinion it was about 55 or 60
percent opposed which is something that
had stayed pretty steady
as for Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot they
were a little bit exceptional usually
they take a corporate to stand on this
issue they didn't for whatever reason I
think you'd have to look into their
particular point of view and motivations
but you're right that's a funny Alliance
Los Angeles good afternoon hi professor
Chomsky I just took the class Chapman
University I had a question I was
wondering where do you think how and who
do you think she regulates the content
of the media Janet Reno was just in
Congress speaking about how TV violence
should be stopped do you think the
the company's the media itself could
control themselves or do you think there
should be a regulating force
governmental force behind it
well I'm personally very skeptical about
any form of regulation of any kind of
speech now the media don't even begin to
approximate freedom of speech I mean
this is the kind of freedom where people
who own the place set the rules so
that's not real freedom nevertheless the
idea of X even in that kind of system
heavily skewed towards extreme wealth
personally I'd be reluctant I'm very
reluctant to see any kind of regulation
take place freedom speech is a really
important value we've over the centuries
we've particularly in the United States
won a lot of you know one substantial
freedom of speech and I think we ought
to preserve it however with regard to
the media I think there's a much more
serious question should the media be
democratized I mean if the media are our
institutions of private power we can be
quite sure that they're going to have
have a particular take on things they're
going to give a picture of the world
which by and large reflects the
interests of their owners and their
advertisers and other centers of power
in the society and that means that the
attitudes and points of view and
interests of the general public are
going to be marginalized and I think the
answer to that is not you know
regulation its democratization the
specific question of violence on the
media - Hardman I I think you have to
have a balance between which is not easy
to just determine between allowing full
freedom of expression and imposing some
restrictions on what people are exposed
to so for example even the most
passionate advocate of freedom of speech
does not believe that say I have a right
to go into your living room and put up a
pornographic poster or something that's
an that's you might say my inability to
do that's a restriction of freedom of
speech but I think everyone agrees with
that when you move to a say poster in
Times Square saying you know I don't
know some obscene thing or this graceful
thing the issue becomes more complex
because it's not really private space
it's
the space where you are and the conflict
between the right to private space and
the right to freedom of speech begins to
be ambiguous when you go to the media
becomes even more ambiguous it's in a
sense private space I mean that's given
the way the society is you just kind of
you know you're not compelled but you're
at least driven to being exposed to it
and therefore what's on it
is kind of involvement in your private
space but at a more remote step it's at
this point that values become difficult
than decisions become difficult however
my own bias at least would be against
now I think the but that the burden
proof has to be on anyone who wants to
introduce any form of regulation in my
opinion Washington DC good afternoon hi
professor Chomsky I'm also a fan of
yours read at least five or six dear
books and many of your articles over the
years I work quote within the system
here in Washington DC I have for about
ten years and I was wondering your
perspective on the election of Bill
Clinton over George Bush and what do you
think there's any positive difference
whatever for either the American people
or people internationally of his being
elected there is some difference between
what Bush represented and what Clinton
represented I mean Clinton was
essentially a what's called a moderate
Democrat that I mean I'm kind of a
right-wing a pro-business Democrat a new
a new Democrat and that means it was
very difficult to distinguish that from
moderate Republican but there were some
differences if you look at the campaign
for one thing the Republicans and
Democrats have rather different
constituencies the Republicans are quite
openly the party of business they don't
pretend to be much else the result is
that they don't really appeal to it
popular constituency the way the
Democrats do they by and large have to
appeal to constitute public constituency
on the basis of jingoist appeals fear
religious fundamentalism and so on you
could tell it from the
looking convention and that's a
substantial part of the population and
that the Democrats on the other hand put
themselves forward as the popular as the
party of you know the working people and
the ethnic minorities and women and so
on in fact in practice they're just
another more less another business party
but the difference in constituency shows
so when these parties are in power
although the major decisions that they
make keep to the essential agenda of the
state corporate Nexus which doesn't
change a lot on other issues which are
of less significance to a major private
power they do different things so on
issues of say civil the the Reagan
administration and Bush's well carried
out a very substantial attack on civil
rights and I would and and that harms
the interests of the popular
constituency of the Democrats in fact
the general public and I would expect
and I think we already see a slight
difference in that respect things like
say a limited amount of family leave
which every just about every industrial
country has in fact far more than we
Bush beat Clinton passed it again that's
a sort of throwing crumbs to the
constituency these crumbs are not minor
incidentally with regard to how what our
lives are like but they're very minor
with respect to the major interests of
maximization of power and will so if you
read say The Wall Street Journal the
main business journal you'll find
they're very enthusiastic about business
and about Clinton and describe him as
one of the best candidates big business
could imagine despite the fact that on
say social programs and other things he
may not be entirely to their taste there
were there was also a difference that
you could detect on major economic
policy the Clinton administration called
much more openly for state intervention
to support and protect major economic
centers than the Republicans did though
both they're all protectionist the
Republicans tended to be a bit more
ideological about it and not to
intervene not to call so openly for
sort of so extremely for intervention to
protect business from market forces the
Clinton called a bit more for that in
fact it's done a bit more so Clinton's
national export strategy announced in
late September called for an extension
of policies that the Reaganites and Bush
had pursued which were in violation of
GATT is everyone admitted and Clinton
wanted to extend that was put rather
well by the Secretary of Treasury Lloyd
Bentsen I said something like good I'm
tired of this level playing field
business I want the playing field tilted
more core the interest of the US
business so we always built the playing
field in the interest of US business but
they wanted to tilt it a bit more and
I'm interested in educational history
and I think that like the media higher
education has played a role in
reinforcing corporate interests and I'm
wondering do you believe that higher
education in the future is going to
become more democratic or democratic
depends on what people like you do about
it
if there is no popular involvement in
this private power will have its impact
which is significant and that's gonna
make it less democratic for the
universities and the whole educational
system to be more democratic there has
to be some counter balancing force to
private power and that only
counterbalancing force can be public
involvement in democratization so to the
extent that such forces exist the
universities can become more democratic
in fact they have become more so in the
last thirty years in my opinion we have
with just a few seconds left you've
written so much already and you
mentioned earlier three or four books in
progress
what do you hope comes from your
writings
my hope is that it'll stimulate people
to try to ask questions about the world
and find their answers I mean I have
what I think are my answers but I think
if people have a broader range of
analysis and information available to
them they're in a position that come up
with
better insight and better understanding
or at least so I hope and then of course
I hope they'll do something about it
because just having the ideas in your
mind doesn't change the world Noam
