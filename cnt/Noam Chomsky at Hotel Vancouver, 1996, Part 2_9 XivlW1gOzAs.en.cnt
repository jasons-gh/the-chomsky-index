and the people who are scared are not
the ones who are harmed by it crime
mostly harness the poor it's mostly poor
people harming each other and they're
not the ones who are saying let's build
more jails the propaganda that crime
like the propaganda about drugs is a
technique of population control for one
thing it targets a superfluous
population it targets people you want to
get rid of like the kind of people who
wouldn't say Colombia you send the death
squads after their kind of superfluous
and in fact it's very carefully shaped
the whole crime story to attack black
males primarily so if you look at the
population of black males they're being
devastated by by this and it was
specifically targeted for them there
isn't virtually no doubt about it
all right so on the one hand has that
effect and the race class correlation is
close enough is not perfect but it's
close enough from the United States to
your role also going after poor working
people this way people you really don't
want around like you know the people you
send out to the into the desert or kill
or something in less civilized countries
in the nares and the the so while crime
is and the other thing is doing is
scaring everybody else well that's a
technique of population control if
you're kicking people in the face you're
harming them and most people are getting
harmed by social policy you want them to
think about something else and one you
want to be afraid of something it's like
like the Jews that the homosexuals or
somebody or other everybody hits the
same technique because there aren't a
lot of techniques around and in this
case one way of terrifying the
population is crimes the other is crazed
Arabs and you know all sorts of other
things but crime right at home is is a
good so since nineteen eight around nine
if you go back to 1980 the US was kind
of at the high end of the industrial
world and incarceration but now it's off
this paper if the during the Reagan
years the number of prisoners tripled
without any change in the crime rate
and under Bush and Clinton it's been now
it's going out being faster it was long
ago left South Africa
behind Russia it was left behind a long
time ago actually Russia caught up for a
while after the reform started and it
began to understand how to behave but
now we've passed Russia again and it's
bridges off the scale in terms of per
capita incarceration and still going up
well that's the that has a lot of effect
Evans gotten to this it's gotten to the
point where instantly crime rates in the
United States are not particularly are
their high but not unusually high so if
you compare the United States with other
industrial countries again the u.s. is
kind of it's a hot hand but not I don't
think it's first in any there's one
crime in which the United States really
is totally by itself and that's a
homicide with guns but that is not it
was crime you know that's because of the
crazy gun culture but so like if this
domestic where it would be domestic you
know like a domestic problem in some
other country ends up somebody getting
murdered in the United States because
their guns all over the place but if you
take that aside you look at you know
robbery is rapes you know car thefts or
whatever the u.s. is at the high end but
not unusually so on the other hand the
rate of incarceration which was not very
different from other industrial
countries around 1980 is now radically
different and that's another that's
really a reflection of social policy
it's kind of comparable to the fact that
say inequality in the US was which was
at the high end of the industrial world
but in the spectrum around 1980 is now
off the scale as all these things are
Fix of the same kinds of social policy
now why the front the security system is
growing up very fast now you hear a lot
of talk about the I'm a little off your
topic but I'll get back to you hear a
lot of talk about how if you project
health expenses it'll bankrupt the
country well you know that's mostly
nonsense but the fact is if you want to
play that game if you project prison
building that will bankrupt the country
even faster in fact the RAND Corporation
did a study a year or two ago in which
they pointed out that at the rate at
which California was imprisoning people
by some year 2000 or something like that
they would have nothing left in the
state budget for education everything
would have to be going to prisons and
that's the kind of projection you get
well let's come back why is this going
on well it's not like the Pentagon for
one thing it has a it has a function it
does have the function of use of force I
mean in the case of the Pentagon you
know keeps the world under control in
the case of the security system it kind
of like the Gallic social cleansing in
Colombia as well as controlling the rest
of the population by frightening them
but like the Pentagon it has another
function it is a significant our rather
significant Keynesian stimulus for the
economy I mean it's gotten to the point
where area their rural counties which is
where most of the prisons goes are
competing for prisons because it you
know money for the construction industry
and the security guard is the fest was
maybe still is the fastest-growing
white-collar profession in the United
States plus there's big money involved
the
running they're getting privatized and
running a federal prison it can be very
lucrative I mean some of these companies
are now you know quite wealthy
in fact it's gotten to the point where
even high-tech industry is noticing they
figure they may have another scam
alongside the Pentagon to feed off
public funds so it got to the point
where the Wall Street Journal buddy two
years ago or so had an article
discussing the opportunities for
high-tech industry to get into the
security business you know you even
plant electrodes and people and you have
supercomputers of having them under
surveillance and so and it's not crazier
than you know shooting down missiles in
outer space or something like that these
are all kind of covers for getting new
technology funded and while this is
nowhere near the scale of the Pentagon
it's noticeable the big investment firms
like Merrill Lynch and so on are
floating tax-free bonds for prison
construction so as part of its into big
business so here's two part these are
the two parts of the state system which
are in fact growing which again tells
you something about how much they want
to balance the budget well the budget
balancing if it has to be very carefully
honed it has to be used as a weapon
against any part of the government
system that goes to other than the rich
the part that goes to the rich that goes
up you know or the part that's there for
population control that part of the
budget goes up well coming back to the
first question who's right from an
economic point of view about the effect
about balancing the budget like just how
important is it should one think it's an
important thing to do the public thinks
it isn't the business world thinks it is
but for reasons that are irrelevant
I mean irrelevant on economic grounds at
least but if you ask on economic grounds
is it the right thing to do what's the
answer well first of all a qualification
has to be made right off on any such
question almost nobody knows anything so
almost everything that said is guesswork
any honest economist told
that if you tell them the answer you
want
he'll construct the model to give you
that answer and within a pretty big
range and in fact most most of these
questions things are sort of large come
there is some knowledge but a large part
of it is historical evidence and you
know sort of judgment questions and so
on so whose judgment is right well
there's something first of all is the
text of the United States is the is the
debt high well not by historical
standards in fact it's about what it was
in the late 50s and considerably let
relative to GNP GDP you know the
national economy which is the only
relevant measure it's less than I was
say in the early 50s in fact it's much
less than it was during the biggest
growth period after World War two and
historically that's about what it's been
the US has always run a big debt that's
kept turning over it used the debt to
invest and pay off the debt through
growth and also cutting it back through
inflation since up until throughout the
whole 19th century during the really big
growth periods u.s. had very high higher
definite has now so you can argue that
somehow the debt is out of sight I mean
it didn't grow very fast during the
Reagan years fact most of the debt is
Reagan did but that was again to cut
social spending and it's substantial
because of the Reagan years but not by
historical standards certainly not
outlined by historical standards in fact
I think the u.s. deficit deficit is not
dead remember the u.s. deficit is now
the lowest in the OECD relative to the
economy right alongside Japan I forget
which one's lower but the u.s. and Japan
and I think are the two lowest and in
the industrial world relative to the
