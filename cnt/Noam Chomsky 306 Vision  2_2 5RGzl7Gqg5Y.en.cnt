how important our george w bush's
religious beliefs as they relate to u.s.
foreign policy the fact is that every
American president since Jimmy Carter
who I think was authentic everyone since
then has been compelled or maybe some of
them do it by choice but it's a
requirement that you may be kind of a
something like a born-again Christian if
you're not you don't compete in the
system so Bill Clinton was singing
Psalms and church every Sunday morning
enthusiastically what he was thinking
about you can figure out my guess is is
about as religious as I am but that's a
prerequisite for appearing on the
political stage for some people it's
probably authentic for others it's
probably something they're crafted to do
and it doesn't make any difference one
way or another what they are what imma
firin care what their personalities are
that's between them and their wives and
children what I'm interested in is what
they do and as far as I know there's no
correlation between what they do in any
religious beliefs that they either have
or thought the professor last question
has the religion of anti-communism been
displaced by anti terrorism and is this
morphing into anti-islam as the new
religion well that the last is certainly
what Osama bin Laden hopes I mean
whatever's going on in his contorted
mind one thing is clear he would love to
have a war of civilizations he would
love to incite a war between the west
and Islam fact that's one of the main
goals people in planning positions in
the United States if they have any
intelligence certainly don't want it and
there's no historical reason to assume
that it's true the u.s. is quite
acumatica land its foreign relations so
for example Indonesia was the largest
Islamic state in the world and the
United States was very supportive of
Indonesia
was canada as long as it was in being
run by someone who's indistinguishable
from Saddam Hussein who came into power
with killing maybe a million people and
compiled one of the worst records of
terrorism and atrocities in the world
and all that time Canada in the united
states were quite happy with him even
though it was an Islamic state on the
other hand say in the 1980s this relates
to the war on terror I remember the
people are now in Washington most of
them also were in leadership positions
in the Reagan administration which came
into office in 1981 declaring that a war
on terror would be the centerpiece of US
foreign policy and under that framework
carried out massive etre terrorist
atrocities around the world particularly
in Central America where one of their
targets was the Catholic Church well as
their a war between the United States in
the Catholic Church there was in Central
America and in fact the that's more than
symbolic that the horrible decade was
opened with the assassination of an
archbishop who had become a voice for
the voiceless and ended with the brutal
murder of six leading Jesuit
intellectuals by elite forces armed and
trained by the United States and in fact
though people don't like to talk about
it the US Army understands that so if
you go to the School of the Americas the
famous school where they trained Latin
American officer is one of their talking
points as they call it that tell people
how wonderful they are is quoting it
that the US Army helped the feet
liberation theology and that's true
there was a war between the US military
and the Latin American Catholic Church
which had adopted a preferential option
for the poor and was working to help
poor people so they had to be
slaughtered we wouldn't conclude that
there's a war between the United States
and the Catholic Church it's just that
if the Catholic Church was
working to organize and help poor
peasants yes it becomes an enemy just as
if they call themselves communists or if
they call themselves anything else as
for the current war on terror we should
bear in mind that is a Reedy clared war
rida clared in the same rhetoric as 20
years earlier by very much the same
people we have a record of what they did
during the first phase of the war on
terror it's very recent actually
continues through the 1990s and it's
just elementary sanity to look at that
record and those people and their
declarations and make some judgments
about the rida cleared war thank you
very much mr. Chomsky thanks Noam
Chomsky recently celebrated his 74th
birthday happy belated birthday
