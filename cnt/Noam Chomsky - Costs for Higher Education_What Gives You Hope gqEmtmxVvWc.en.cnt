okay we have a question about education
higher education what do you and popular
education what do you recommend for
people who want to study at university
university level but cannot afford it
and do not want to get tangled up in
loans and debt well what they ought to
do I mean this you know you can't answer
the question for an individual but we
should be answering it collectively so
we should be asking it for exam why is
there why are there costs for higher
education that why isn't it like
secondary education and again that's not
a strange question there's certainly no
economic basis for it if you look around
the world today the richest most
successful countries have free virtually
free higher education so Germany which
is the most successful of the modern
state capitalist societies higher
education is virtually free the Finland
which comes out at the top and almost
all international competitions free and
so on across the board
you go to poor countries just go south
of the border to Mexico poorer country
quite a respectable higher education
system in there and thoughts it's very
quite respectable high quality has
problems like very low salaries so the
faculty have to have second jobs but
that's because it's a very poor country
education is free take a look at our own
country in the 1940s and 1950s 50s and
60s the great growth period highest
birth period in American society higher
education was virtually free for a huge
number of people it was known as free
but subsidized namely those
beneficiaries of the GI Bill people have
never would have gone to college were
unable to do so very good for themselves
very good for the country contributed to
successful economic growth even private
colleges like Ivy League colleges though
they had tuition it
is extremely low I entered the
University of Pennsylvania and Ivy
League college in 1945 that tuition was
$100 that would be maybe $800 by today's
real value and you could easily get a
scholarship so it was essentially free
that was a much poorer country then the
US today is far richer than it was in
that period I think if you think it
through that it can't really be an
economic reason for this there are other
reasons not good reasons didn't think
what they might be but I think an answer
to the question an individual is stuck
you gotta that person is stuck with what
exists but as part of a collective that
person is not stuck now they can be part
of an effort to reverse the programs of
the past the policies of the past 30
years roughly 30 40 years and which have
led to the situation in which young
people are trapped for life with debt
that they cannot get rid of notice that
the Paul I'm sure you know this the
policies are set up so that you can't
declare bankruptcy like a business the
government can garnish your Social
Security
you're trapped for life a highly
disciplinary measure incidentally and I
don't think there's any justification
for it like other things individually
you can't do much about it collectively
you could do quite a lot
what gives you hope people like you
that's the hope of the future the
futures in your hands there's a lot that
can be done despite all the problems of
the country it's actually a much more
civilized country than it was 50 years
ago much more and all kinds of ways the
role of the rights of Rights of women
for example all sorts of other things
that's didn't come as a gift came out of
popular struggle often pretty hard but
it left the legacy to us we benefit from
it it kind of gives us a plateau from
which to go on plenty of problems in
fact the worst problems in human history
but they can be addressed and people
like you were in a position to address
them and that's where the hope is
