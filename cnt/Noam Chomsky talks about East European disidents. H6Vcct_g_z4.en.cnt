there were of course dissidents in
Eastern Europe infected but they're very
different from the dissidents elsewhere
in the world they're much more concerned
with themselves not with they're not
internationally oriented that's where
it's very striking I mean let me give
you an example so just to give an
illustration and relating to
Czechoslovakia the I mentioned last
night that immediately after the fall of
the Berlin Wall in El Salvador us
dependency the high command of the army
sent a murderous battalion which had a
lot a record of thousands of killings
sent them to attack the University and
murder six leading Latin American
intellectuals Jesuit priests which they
did a couple of days after that fought
Slav Havel came to the United States
spoke before a joint session of Congress
and got rousing applause when he praised
the United States as the defenders of
freedom okay now just imagine the
situation reversed
I suppose that the Soviet Russian
trained Russian armed forces were sent
into a university in Czechoslovakia and
murdered Havel and half a dozen of his
associates and imagined that a Latin
American intellectual were to come to
Russia speak at the duma and praise the
russians as the defenders of freedom
that is absolutely inconceivable but
when it happens for from an Eastern
European dizon it's not only conceivable
but it has
and it's applauded and that's very
characteristic the Eastern European
dissidents as compared with others
tended to regard themselves as the only
oppressed people in the world in fact
the term dissing just means Eastern
European you don't even talk about the
murdered latin intellect as Latin
Americans as dissident and in fact I'm
sure none of you ever heard their names
everyone knows the names of the East
European dissidents if I were to run
through the names of the murdered Latin
Americans including an archbishop who
was murdered while he was reading this
you would never have heard of them and I
think the point was that the Eastern
European dissidents were uniquely
privileged though the only dissidents in
history who have ever had the massive
support of the most powerful systems in
the world so they were honored lauded
not because they were unusual in fact
other dissidents were treated much more
harshly but because they were in an
enemy state so therefore you lured them
and praised them and they came to
internalize that they came to
internalize the view that they are the
only people who were oppressed and
therefore they have they don't share the
kind of internationalism that's common
to dissidents in most of the world which
is a very striking difference we see it
when you travel around the world and are
in contact with dissident elements and I
had a feeling to get back to the
beginning that the insularity
of the perspective probably reflects the
same thing some sense that Eastern
Europe was uniquely oppressed so we're
only concerned with theirs
in fact it was oppressed but by
comparative standards that much less
than in u.s. domains much less you
didn't have hundreds of thousands of
people slaughtered the you didn't have
the Archbishop's assassinated while they
were reading math and have Latin
American that you don't have
intellectuals is heads were blown off by
a Russian trained the terrorist forces
and on the record inside Latin America
or Philippines Southeast Asia was much
worse than Eastern Europe in the post
Stalin era but that conception is not
comprehended
