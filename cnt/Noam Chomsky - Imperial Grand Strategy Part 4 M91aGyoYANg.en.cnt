actions designed to strangle and in fact
in this case also terrorize a country
for reasons that are understood it's a
very free country the United States have
a huge documentary record so come out
triumph two of us democracy that we have
such records it's not a triumph of US
democracy nobody knows about them that's
different that's a condemnation of the
educational system and the media and so
on but if you look at the records which
are available you find the reasons I
mean do with the Russians it was because
of what the what they called 40 years
ago Cuba's successful defiance of US
policy is going back 150 years namely
the Monroe Doctrine which established
that the u.s. runs the hemisphere and
Cuba was carrying out successful
defiance of this and therefore they
should be subject to massive terrorism
economic strangulation leading right up
to the present well that's what you can
know if you want to find out the the as
I say these things are perfectly well
known in Latin America as are many other
things so for example in Latin America
rarely here there were plenty of
commemorations last total weeks ago of
what's called in Latin America the other
nine eleven namely the 30 years ago the
bombing of the presidential palace and
Joey which led immediately to the death
of by very conservative estimates about
3,000 people probably many more than
that three thousand and chili would be
the equivalent of about sixty thousand
in the United States and we might
consider it significant if 60,000 people
were killed in the United States and a
day of terror but here it's not
significant primarily because
the US was instrumental in carrying out
the terror so therefore it didn't happen
that's little own what happened later
however for the rest of the world had
happened and in particular in Latin
America it happened and they know about
it well that is an opening to the second
aspect freedom and democracy abroad the
current administration is called often
neo Reaganite it's a good term because
they are mostly recycled from the Reagan
administration or the bush one
administration the term neo Reagan I in
the media professional literature and so
on that refers to what the New York
Times called Reagan's yearning for
democracy which is now fortunately
revived so once again we have a yearning
for democracy it was revived most
recently in a speech by George Bush
couple of weeks ago in which he
announced that the United States is
dedicated to democracy in Iraq in the
Middle East all over the world
organizing a new crusade for democracy
real turning point in American policy
well that speech was greeted in the US
by commentators and to some extent in
England with reverential awe particular
off for the leading visionary who
running the crusade Wolfowitz there's an
interesting column there are many but
one that I recommend that if you haven't
seen it is in the washington post on
november second by their leading
political commentator a longtime
political analyst david ignatius while
you're reading it yet to keep pinching
yourself to remind yourself that you
know North Korea but have a look it's
worth looking at tells you something
about the country it a great off or this
magnificent declaration and for what it
proves namely that the invasion of Iraq
was the noblest war in history
undertaken for purely altruistic motives
just to bring democracy to suffering
people the oil was particularly directed
at Paul Wolfowitz described as a grand
visionary whose heart bleeds for the
sufferer lip quoting that his heart
bleeds with the suffering of Arabs it's
as white as such wonderful things and so
it continues well actually what they
couple of days later by accident the
washington post published a poll just
taken in iraq in which people were asked
one of the things why they thought the
united states they didn't use the word
invade whatever they said but why the
United States invaded Iraq and thus
there were people who agreed with the
Washington Post and pull on David
Ignatius that the u.s. entered to bring
democracy one percent so it wasn't zero
well interesting fact one of many but we
might ask why you know how come I women
ask how other people reacted in the
Middle East well there he was complete
and ridicule in fact all over the world
outside the United States and
limited extent England the reaction to
Bush's speech was simply ridiculed well
how can that be if we greet it with all
on reverence probably the reason is that
other people don't understand that the
magnificence of the United States is
true by definitions effects just don't
matter and they may have looked at the
fact for example some of them may
actually have read Bush's speech where
he listed countries of the Middle East
and ranked them in terms of their
progress toward democracy well as was
very quickly pointed out the ranking had
nothing to do with their progress toward
democracy in fact was often the opposite
but it had everything to do with whether
they were following orders the more they
were following orders the more they were
advancing toward democracy even if they
were increasing torture and so on and so
forth well you know people notice that
if they're not properly educated like we
are we don't notice it all so it really
takes a very good education to miss the
fact that there is exactly one elected
leader in the Middle East a leader
elected in a reasonably fair election
but internationally supervised everybody
said it's a fair election his name has
to be us or our fo now he's the one
elected leader in the Middle East well
how does that get treated by the Bush
administration and Paul Wolfowitz and
their visionary efforts to bring
democracy simple kick him out why
because he isn't doing his job he was
allowed to take over it on one condition
namely control the population and permit
Clinton and the Israeli government to
carry out the settlement development
operations in the occupied territories
which are gradually integrating it under
Israeli control
have to continue effect in Clinton's
last year the year 2000 what everyone
was falling over themselves about the
magnificence of his offers which were
incidentally never you never saw him was
one single map of the proposal in the
United States because it gives the game
away but in that last year Clinton's
last year also Barak's last year or a
settlement activity reached his peak and
the occupied territories meaning
building what are called facts on the
ground well our efforts job was to keep
the population quiet while this was
happening and as long as he did it he
was just fine nobody cared how many
people he tortured nobody nobody cared
about the vast corruption which was
enormous you do anything like as long as
he did his job keeping the population
quiet when he failed to do that job to
make the slightest bit of difference
that he's popularly elected and agreed
to be the most popular political figure
just doesn't matter toss him out bring
in somebody who the US wants who they
agreed but quite openly didn't have any
political support but maybe he would do
the job so that's our contribution to
democracy in the last few months in the
Middle East well you know not everyone
is well educated and as disciplined as
we are so they look at this and they
look at the speech and they fall over
you know fall into the year aisles and
laughter one of the problems with
lacking education another problem they
have is that they may have a little
historical memory so for example there
may be people who can actually remember
something as far back as a 45 months ago
when quite an interesting episode took
place in the United States I can't even
think of it analogue to it there was a
display of raisin hatred and contempt
for democracy almost throughout the
entire spectrum in the US which I just
can't think of anything like it that was
the story right before run during the
Iraq war about Old Europe and new Europe
you will remember that so old Europe are
the really bad guys like France and
Germany and new Europe by the good guys
like Berlusconi and Ozma who are the
Grand Churchillian figures leading the
world to democracy in contrast to also
some of the east european satellites
were allowed in they were also grand
figures the former Russian satellites
that's new Europe what was the criterion
that distinguished new Europe from Old
Europe I'm again it takes a good
education not to see it it was very
precise old europe the bad guys are the
countries where the government's took
the same position as the large majority
of the population new europe the good
guys are leading the way to democracy
are the countries of the leaders
overruled an even larger majority the
population in virtually every case and
took their orders from Crawford Texas so
therefore they're Democrats the most and
has passed without a comment almost some
of the press was a little honest about
it like The Wall Street Journal which
often is more honest they have a more
trustworthy audience I guess so they
actually quoted the foreign minister of
Latvia who was asked wyd Latvia went
along with the United States when the
population was overwhelmingly opposed
and he said well you know we know that
you have to say yes sir and do what they
tell us to do they've had some
experience with that
so they understand that that's how you
get the democratic credentials after all
they were of people's democracy now so
they know how democracy works but for
the most part this passed without any
comment actually the most interesting
case was turkey turkey about ninety-five
percent of the population opposed
involvement of the war in the war and to
everyone's amazement including mine the
Turkish government actually went along
with ninety-five percent of the
population they were immediately
denounced bitterly by Colin Powell the
administration moderate who announced
they're going to be punished by cutting
back loans and so on commentators all
across the press condemned them for
literally lacking democratic credentials
because they were not taking orders from
Washington and doing what ninety-five
percent of the population wanted without
a flicker of embarrassment the most
extreme was Paul Wolfowitz Paul
Wolfowitz actually denounced the Turkish
military for not intervening as they
could to prevent the government from
thought of keeping to the will of
ninety-five percent of the population
that's the visionary leading the way to
democracy well that's all the air do is
put it together and there are people who
somehow notice those things what about
Wolfowitz his heart bleeding for the
poor suffering Muslims and I must
explain why he was one of the strongest
supporters and advocates of general
suharto first as ambassador under Reagan
and then continuing afterwards as late
as 1997 just a couple of months before
so far that was overthrown by an
internal revolt so heart those ranks
right along with Saddam Hussein
it's one of the worst mass murderers and
torturers of the latter part of the 20th
century but he was doing his job he was
opening up his rich country to Western
exploitation so it didn't matter how
many hundreds thousands of people he
killed or how many people were rotting
away in jail for decades and being
tortured and so on and so forth
Wolfowitz heart was bleeding for the
poor suffering people by lauding the
mass murder and torture well that's not
the only part of his history maybe other
people have memory that goes back a
little further to the days when he was
in Reagan State Department with
responsibility for Asia so that meant
that he was supporting Marcos dictator
Gen and South Korea both brutal killers
and torturers right to the end of their
rule and there's now a reconstruction of
history but if you look at the actual
history yes that's what it was right to
the end until they simply could not be
maintained any longer they're being
overthrown by internal revolt you can't
however blame him for some other things
so you can't blame them for supporting
Duvalier till the end or chacha skoo who
was easily the counterpart of Saddam
Hussein and was supported right to the
day of his final overthrow by the Reagan
and Bush administration is one of their
favorites in fact Noriega rather minor
thug who they supported and quite a cast
of quite an interesting rogues gallery
take a look at the people who were
supported by the current incumbents in
Washington it's pretty impressive right
to the time that they were overthrown
strongly supported and the rogue's
gallery gets new names every day so not
long ago the ruler of Equatorial Guinea
obiang was welcomed in the White House
yeah
our terrible torture and killer but
sitting on a large pool of oil so he was
welcomed and in fact actually had an
election in which he won ninety-seven
percent of the vote another current
favorite is Carrie Moff and who's Becca
stun who's again properly compared with
Saddam Hussein gotten worse and worse
since the US started supporting him
recently the British ambassador was
recalled from Uzbekistan because he had
the temerity to condemn the dictator and
described for example the way he gets
rid of his opponents by a boiling them
to death so he was taken back to London
to teach him some manners so we can add
him and so it continues without change
right alongside the you know the
reverence for the new love of democracy
and the vision as visionaries carrying
it forward well you also can't blame
Wolfowitz for you at the support of the
current incumbents for Saddam Hussein
that's Rumsfeld Powell Cheney Bush one
administration supported their favorite
killer in the region right through his
worst atrocities because they didn't
care now they claim to be upset about
them but not at the time continued to
support him and provide him with means
for developing weapons of mass
destruction long after the war with Iran
had
thing to do with that that's another
excuse in fact they gave the reasons
publicly the reasons were Bush number
one explained his administration the
reasons for supporting Saddam after the
atrocities after the war was our
responsibility to American exporters so
doesn't matter how many people they gas
or kill we have a responsibility to
support American exporters if they want
to help them develop weapons of mass
destruction is our responsibility if you
take a look at the statements they also
added the usual boilerplate about how
supporting Saddam Hussein will help
improve the human rights situation and
bring stability and so on and so forth
all on the public record right up till
the day of the invasion of quaint in
fact rarely reported but it's in the
public record and then they return to
support for Saddam in 1991 now you read
you know agonized reports of the hideous
mass graves that are being unearthed in
southern Iraq Thomas Friedman uses that
to demonstrate that it really was
immoral war agonizing over the mass
graves which he knew about perfectly
well in the spring of nineteen ninety
one was perfectly well known that's when
the u.s. authorized Saddam to crush an
internal rebellion that might have ever
thrown him the reasons were explained in
print for example by Thomas Friedman who
approved of it because as he put it the
best possible the best of all worlds for
the United States would be an
iron-fisted military junta which would
rule Iraq just the way Saddam did he's
kind of an embarrassment but there isn't
anyone else left to back him while the
main New York Times Middle East
correspondent Alan Cowell explained that
we have to know
kind of upset about all the slaughter
and terror and so on but there is he
said a near unanimous view meaning the
u.s. accepted that Saddam offers better
hope for the stability of Iraq than the
people who are trying to overthrow him
meaning we don't want to Iraqis to rule
Iraq and if we can't do it we'd rather
have so done all of that in the papers
you can read it in 1991 while the mass
graves were being filled by Saddam's
terror authorized by the US now the time
has come to agonize over them and to
talk about how awful this was we have to
have a noblest war in history because of
it and no one will be so unkind as to
mention what the same people wrote when
they knew all about it as it was
happening and they could have stopped
that if they'd wanted well another
tribute to the discipline of properly
educated people you also can't blame
Wolfowitz for Africa that was the
specialty of administration moderates
like Colin Powell for example during the
Reagan administration in Africa and the
country's neighboring South Africa
Angola Mozambique in those countries
about a million and a half people were
killed and over sixty billion dollars of
damage were caused by south african
aggression and atrocities supported by
the United States the that's just during
the Reagan years the Congress did impose
constraints forced at the legislated
sanctions against South Africa but the
Reagan administration found ways around
them and they were able to increase
trade and support for South Africa
afterwards meanwhile condemning the
Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress as one of the
more notorious terrorist organizations
in the world was during the period when
towel was National Security Advisor same
time the u.s. undermined the major UN
effort to condemn terrorism the West
there were several but the major one was
in December 1987 a very strong
resolution condemning terrorism and all
its forms calling on everyone to do
everything possible to stamp out the
plague there were two votes against it
the United States and reflexively Israel
a one country abstained Honduras
probably the ambassador at a stomach
ache that day or something otherwise
unanimous but effectively vetoed when
the u.s. votes against a resolution its
heat dude in fact doubly vetoed because
it's also banned from reporting and
banned from history so it's unknown also
unknown are the reasons why the United
States and Israel banned the resolution
against terror they explained it in the
General Assembly debate and on the
public record the reason was one
paragraph we said nothing in this
resolution prejudices the right of
people to struggle for their freedom
under racist and colonialist regimes and
foreign military occupation in accord
with the charter of the United Nations
and to gain support from others to do so
well the US and Israel obviously
couldn't support that paragraph because
the phrase racist and colonialist
regimes referred to the apartheid regime
of South Africa which they were
supporting and the foreign military
occupation referred to the occupied
territories were allowed to resist
occupation because the u.s. supports it
well that's the major resolution on
terrorism we're during a decade
which we're terrorism was the lead issue
you know top issue of the day war on
terror you know playing the modern age
returned the barbarism etc but we can't
talk about this anymore than we can talk
about any other things I mentioned
because it's the wrong story for the
United States not for the rest of the
world what about Latin America which was
the where the supposed to be where the
triumph of Reagan's yearning for
democracy was taking place well it was
kind of an entity poll that I mentioned
in Iraq where one percent agreed with us
columnist sand commentators that the
u.s. entered direct to preserve
democracy that poll also had a merciful
more interesting answer which shows some
sophistication in one of the questions
in the poll about half the population
said the United States would support
democracy in Iraq but would control it
okay well that's sophisticated that
shows an understanding of history it's
not hard for Iraqis to have that
understanding they've had a century of
experience with it since Iraq was
created by the British it was to be free
and independent I've had some Parliament
and everything else except that as the
British internal secret records
described it in Iraqis knew without
bothering the read secret record ear act
like other countries in the region was
to be run by what the British called an
Arab facade which would carry out local
administration and management while the
British effectively ruled from behind
the scenes behind one or another
constitutional fiction as they put it
like say democracy and the locals would
be allowed to
you know tow cars that are illegally
parked for example and other such
activities but if they're we got a line
British muscle would be there to make
sure they get back in the line and
that's the kind of democracy the Iraqis
for some odd reason expect the United
States to institute partly because their
own history but partly because they may
for example know something about the
history of Latin America including
during the Reagan era of yearning for
democracy Americans are uniquely unaware
of what happened there it's known in
most of the world not here as it is
known here a little bit so for example
there are some distance call important
scholarly work on the Reagan yearning
for democracy the most important work on
it in fact is done by a Latin American
scholar Thomas Carruthers who the main
broke the main books and articles whose
interesting particularly because he's
also an insider he was working inside
the Reagan State Department in there
what they call democracy enhancement
programs so he's writing both as an
insider and as a scholar describing what
happened and he says the policies were
very sincere as I'm sure they were just
as sincere as Stalin's policies of
bringing democracy to Eastern Europe
actually have good evidence that those
were sincere because the release Russian
archives that are coming out which are
mostly pretty boring do have some
interesting things like the discovery
that internally they talked the same way
they did externally so I meant they're
probably sincere when they talked about
the need to preserve democracy in
Eastern Europe to protect it against
fascism and so on and so forth am
probably very sincere and Carruthers is
probably right to say that the yearning
for democracy was sincere in the Reagan
State Department but he says it was a
failure
he also is honest enough to point out
that it was a systematic failure in
horry striking way in the southern cone
of Latin America you know Brazil
Argentina Chile in the southern come
where the United States had least
influence there was progress toward
democracy which the Reagan
administration opposed every step of the
way but finally had to accept because it
was just taking place in any way on the
other hand in the region nearer the
United States where the US had more
control in fact almost total control he
said the progress was least in fact
virtually none because the USS he puts
it would only tolerate top down forms of
democracy in which traditional elites
who were linked to the United States
would remain in power in other words you
could have pretty much what the Iraqis
expect formal democracy that's good for
public relations purposes as long as
you're guaranteed that they do a get
what they would you tell them and that's
just what's happened in Iraq again it
doesn't take a genius to recognize that
democracy is going to be given to Iraq
under certain conditions the occupying
authorities have already imposed an
economic plan which no sovereign country
would ever accept it opens up the
country to complete takeover by foreign
corporations mainly US corporations and
banks some Iraqis will benefit mainly
the local collaborators with the foreign
owners that's the way the imperial
system has always worked plenty of
people benefit in every every the
poorest country alike in the world you
know southern Africa anywhere else
there's a rich sector which lives at an
incredible level of luxury that's the
traditional elites linked to foreign
power and yes that will have
Iraq but no independent development
that's all under foreign mainly us
control the economic plan that was
imposed illegally incidentally it's in
violation of strict violation of the
Geneva Conventions on occupying powers
rhythm bothering and either that plan so
far has left out the oil industry
because that would just be too blatant
so it will happen indirectly and slowly
in other ways they also announced that
once as soon as the democracy lecture
was given that the government of Iraq
the democratic government would agree
wouldn't have any choice about it to
what amounts to a Status of Forces
Agreement of the usual sort guaranteeing
the right of American military forces to
stay there as long as they like and to
establish military bases their permanent
military bases right at the heart of the
oil-producing region that's extremely
significant so carruthers account of
democracy in Latin America is accurate
the Iraqis understand that even without
reading internal records of the British
or academic studies in the United States
because it's their own history and most
of the people in the world understand it
from just their own lives you know it's
only here we weren't allowed to
understand that much too dangerous I
should say that despite all this there
have been improvements the changes in
American society over the past 40 years
which are significant reflect themselves
in the way these matters are dealt with
so for example no American president
today could possibly carry out the kinds
of terrorist atrocities and say Cuba
that the Kennedy could carry out without
any
batting an eyelash the the country's
just too civilized and there's
interesting examples very striking
examples which ought to be on the front
pages of the newspapers but you can
figure out even though they're not there
so take Brazil the most important
country in Latin America they just
carried out an achievement which is
quite astonishing and from which we
ought to try to learn something if we're
actually interested in democracy they
carried out an achievement in democracy
which is unimaginable in the United
States the popular movements developed
over the past 20 years under very harsh
conditions it's a brutal and repressive
state with a from and they overcame not
only harsh repression but tremendous
concentration of capital and of media
much beyond what we have and elected
their own president who absolutely very
impressive figure nobody remotely like
him in the US political system or the
West anywhere and they did it that's a
democratic achievement which we can't
imagine in the United States most of the
population is well aware elections are
blood you don't have people who
represent the public but in Brazil they
can do it well again that's something
for one thing that would make us feel
humiliated but also from which we could
learn if anybody cared about democracy
it's in it 40 years ago under Kennedy
Brazil also had a populist president nor
near Lula
nothing like it and with nowhere near as
much popular support but he was kind of
a mildly populist president well at that
point the Kennedy administration
organized a military coup which took
place immediately after the
assassination hood or even placed in
motion by John F and Robert Kennedy
which instituted a what's called a
national security state neo-nazi state
torture repression violence it brazil's
an important country so it had a domino
effect throughout the continent one of
the effects was the other 911 which is
one of the other military coup is that
followed in this and they are rid of him
that threat was overcome today there's
no military coup planned in Brazil
though the threat to US corporate and
power interests is much greater why well
there are a number of reasons that we're
thinking about one reason is that the
population of the United States wouldn't
tolerate it any longer nor would the
Brazilians but we're talking about
ourselves which is what matters to us
but people here would not tolerate a
Kennedy style military coup establishing
a neo-nazi state let's just become too
civilized thanks to the activism of
mostly young people in the 60s and the
following years when reason why the 60s
are so bitterly condemned and denounced
in the liberal press so for example last
Sunday's New York Times Book Review but
constantly their hated because they
civilized the country they got people
involved in women's rights and
environmental issues opposition to
aggression and violence and all kind of
horrible things happened then no wonder
its denounced but it did change
the country a lot and people would not
accept the Kennedy style terrorist war
or Kennedy style military coup those are
not possible now fortunately that's
progress and but the other there's
another reason why there's no plan for a
military coup it's not needed the
actions of the Clinton administration
and its predecessors in establishing
international economic arrangements
under the fraudulent cover of free trade
as nothing to do with trade but the
international economic arrangements that
are called neoliberal everywhere else in
the world here they're called free trade
it's a joke and that you see in the
World Trade Organization that were just
brought up to be extended in the Miami
iya atrocities that took place couple
weeks ago those arrangements are very
effective they began around 30 years ago
with the breakdown of the post-war
international economic system first by
liberalisation of capital flow and
deregulation of currencies now it was
well understood that control over
capital flows is critical to democracy
that Keynes pointed out 70 years ago
that unless there are controls over
capital as he put it the experiment with
democracy in the West is seriously
endangered and the reasons are obvious
when you have free flow of capital free
speculation that creates what
international economists call a virtual
Senate of investors and lenders who
carry out a moment-by-moment referendum
on government policy and if the
government is doing something they don't
like like for example improving health
care instead of in
living conditions for investment they
simply destroy the economy and by
attacking the currency by capital flight
other means they have a stranglehold
over countries which is a terrific way
of preventing democracy in fact those
rules on capital controls and regulated
currencies were instituted after the
Second World War in order to permit what
we call welfare states Social Democratic
policies give some range for governments
to carry out policies which had an
enormous popular support after the war
it's taken a long time to break that
down it's slowly being broken down by
corporate capital concentration but it's
taken time one of the methods is to free
up capital flow break down the financial
controls but there are others every
element of the neoliberal package of
what they're selling and Miami is
intended to undermine democracy very
explicitly so it takes a privatization
is there any economic reason for
privatization not that anybody's ever
shown but there is a very good political
reason for privatization it's true it's
almost obvious by definition if you
privatize something it's out of public
control it's out of the public arena
okay it's under the control of
totalitarian institutions unaccountable
totalitarian institutions that's what
corporations are unaccountable
totalitarian institutions with enormous
power put something into their hands
it's out of the public arena so that
reduces the threat of democracy by
definition when it extends to what's
called trade and services mentioned
before things like water then you're
finished services means anything that
any human being could be interested in
like water for example or health or
education or roads or you know
name it anything that would care about
is services trade and services is a
euphemism it means privatization of
services means handing them over to
totalitarian institutions that are
unaccountable to the public that's what
trade and services means as you push
through trading services you narrow the
public arena you continue with this you
end you can end up with formal
democracies and in fact you don't even
need terror anymore or even control of
opinion you need nothing because there's
no public arena left there's nothing for
people to make decisions about it's all
in the hands of tyrannical institutions
which are effectively unaccountable to
the public well that's called
neoliberalism it's also harmful to the
economy but that's secondary those are
the methods that's what's being
discussed you know that's what's at
issue in places like Miami and Cancun
and so on well at this point we're up to
the major methods of controlling and
undermining democracy which have to do
with the main mission of the
organization that's running this event
corporate control obviously the most
powerful institutions in the modern
world plenty to say about them now we're
at the heart of the problem but now I'll
stop it's not about the title that was
an accident
you
or I will thank you for seeing CMAs
today and as you know we want to talk
really about ideas of anarchism your
thoughts on Anika and it's going to be a
rather wander each at okay but hopefully
we'll we'll get somewhere as they never
know all right in I think in in the
middle 90s you in an interview that you
gave you talked about one of the
problems with anarchism was it maybe it
was too negative it criticized but
didn't offer a positive well I don't if
I said that I shouldn't have car I don't
agree with it Ryan fact you can take a
look at the chauffeur yes I was always
yet yeah I mean there are anarchist
studies which offer proposals for
society in such meticulous d2 yeah that
they go beyond anything yeah plausible
in my view like about this aunty on is a
famous case yes yes whoo 1936 I guess
wrote a critique of the anarchist
revolution in Spain and it was an
Argentine anarchist was in Spain and he
called after the revolution or something
like that and he laid out a very
detailed program for what a largely
anarcho-syndicalist vision of Spanish
society or for that matter in each I
ought to be light and there are many
other proposed I mean the question I
think the question about detailed
planning for the future is not so much
can we do it sure we can do it lots of
different ways but whether we know
enough about human beings about society
institutions the effects of introducing
institutional structures into human life
do we know enough about that to be able
to plan in any detail what a society
should look like or should it be an
experimental guided by certain general
ideas about inequality authority and
domination and mr. half people if people
explore different ways of working
through this maze and see what comes
natural to them how much variety there
should be you know what are you going to
do with people who don't want to work
for people with criminal tendencies or
people that want to go to meetings and
you know there's millions of questions
that come up to what extent you want
inter change jobs or delegate
responsibilities on the basis of
interest in talent and so on if somebody
wants to be a carpenter or a nuclear
physicist or a pianist and somebody else
wants to be an administrator that you
necessarily require that they
interchange jobs as a matter of
principle even if they're all happier
you know I don't think we know there's
both positive and negative comments you
can make about that but I don't think we
near the answers I was reading a miser
pointy that the Spanish libertarian
communist series to who was arguing
while the like that and he was arguing
that well you know if one becomes a
teacher one learns by experience and if
one becomes a doctor one learns by
experience wasn't one isn't a doctor
when once 22 you learn and maybe that's
how anak is more to be seen where do we
add a very general level I think we
would all agree the people in the rough
range of
