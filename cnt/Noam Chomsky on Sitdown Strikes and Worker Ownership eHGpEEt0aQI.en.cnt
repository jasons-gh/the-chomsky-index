I mentioned before that in the 1930s one
of the most effective actions was as it
down strike the and the reason is very
simple that's just a step before
takeover of the industry well at 2:00
through the 70s as the decline was
setting in there were some very
important events that took place the one
was in the late seventies the 1977 the
US Steel decided to close one of its
major facilities Youngstown Ohio and
instead of just walking away the
workforce and the community decided to
get together and buy it from u.s. steel
and hand it over to the workforce to run
and turn it into a worker owned worker
management facility they didn't win but
with enough popular support they could
have won and it was a partial victory is
it topic that the Carlyle parables
particularly its discussed in detail as
a partial victory because even though
they lost it set off other efforts and
now throughout Ohio it affected other
places there's a scattering not hundreds
maybe thousands of sometimes not so
small worker owned or at least partially
workaround industries which could become
worker managed and that's the basis for
a real revolution that's how it takes
place it's happening here too
just in one of the suburbs of Boston
about a year ago something similar
happened multinational decided to close
down a profitable functioning
manufacturing facility whose bring some
high-tech
Manufacturing not profitable enough for
them the workforce and the Union offered
to buy it and take it over and run it
themselves
the multinational decided to close it
down instead probably for reasons of
class consciousness I don't think they
want things like this to happen if there
had been enough popular support if
there'd been something like this
movement that it could have gotten
involved they might have succeeded and
there other things going on like that in
fact some of them are major so not long
ago Obama took over the auto industry
it's basically owned by the public and
there were a number of things that could
have been done one was what was done it
reconstituted so that it can be handed
back to the ownership or very similar
ownership and continue on its
traditional path the other possibility
was to hand it over to the workforce
which owned it anyway turned it into
worker-owned worker managed major
industrial system that's a big part of
the economy and have it produced things
that people need
