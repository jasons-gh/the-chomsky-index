if I mentioned to you the neuroscientist
and liberal atheist author Sam Harris
who you had an online debate with he
says he'd rather Republican candidate
ben Carson who said a Muslim shouldn't
be President and has compared Syrian
refugees to dogs
he said that Harris has said he would
rather Carson be President the United
States than you because Carson
apparently gets the threat from
so-called jihadi terrorists that you
don't what's your response to Sam Harris
who claims to be a liberal I don't
bother with Sam Harris this is what he
his he is specializes in hysterical
slanderous charges against people he
doesn't like that's of no interest to me
am I not concerned with jihad a
terrorism I'm much more concerned with
it than he is I've been at that's why I
say you don't just scream at it you look
at the roots you try to figure out how
to deal with it you respond to it I
don't take him seriously I don't see any
point talking about it but well some
people say the point about talking about
it was we live in an environment where
Islamophobia is on the rise in the
United States across the West there are
some who say that the New Atheists
people like Sam Harris Richard Dawkins
the late Christopher Hitchens were
Islamophobes are Islamophobes
a guilty of an almost obsessive
anti-muslim bigotry which is worrying in
the current climate do you share that
view I I don't talk about them
personally drove Dawkins it might have
been true of Hitchens in his later years
Harris I assume denies it but when I
read what he says that's what it looks
like however the problem of Islamophobia
is of course serious just like the
problem of anti-semitism is you need
this is much worse Islamophobia now for
one thing it is undermining us if
Islamophobe it's apart from what it's
doing to decent honorable people who are
subject to denunciation physical attacks
blocking of the possibilities for decent
life what's happening the Syrian
refugees and so on apart from all that
it's harmful to the West
Islamophobia leads to proposals like
let's carpet bomb that let's hit them
with a sanitizing that just take a look
at what it's led to in the last
fifteen years there's been in what's
called a global war on terror when it
began there's been one device to deal
with it
sledgehammer smash them up don't find
out what's going on smash them up what's
happened 15 years ago it was buck it
was confined to a tiny tribal area in
Afghanistan now it's all over the world
every time you hit it with a
sledgehammer you expand it every single
time Afghanistan Iraq Libya everywhere
can you learn something from that shall
we say okay let's smash them up again
because they all want to kill it yeah
that's one reaction another reaction is
the same reaction what you do hear from
people like who knows something about
the topic like Scotty Turan are like
William Pope well known Middle East
expert long experience in the US
government has pretty much the same
proposals you have to deal with
situation rationally if you want to be
first of all humane but even concerned
with your own security
