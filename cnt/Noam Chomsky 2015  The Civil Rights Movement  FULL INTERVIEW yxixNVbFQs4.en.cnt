good morning arm and thank you very much
for participating once again in this
video conference I'm Kathy slaughter and
behind me are students of the degree in
foundation degree in history with
English and history and sociology
students of a level I know it tight for
time so I'm going to ask the first
questioner to begin if that's okay okay
great hello and as we see a worrying
trend of diminishing civil rights
particularly regarding our right to
protest are there any lessons that we
can take from the civil rights movement
in order to protect these rights well
the civil rights movement in the United
States faced problems that you don't
face the south in the early 1960s going
back several hundred years was a very
frightening place people who were young
black students who were trying to
register a black American blacks just
register to vote were murdered beaten
attacked the buses were burned it was
extremely violent and dangerous there's
the plenty of difficulties today but
nothing like that it took enormous
courage for the activists mostly young
people originally mostly black students
others came from the north several
number them were murdered for them to
face the wrath of the civilian society
and also the extreme brutality of the
police and the state troopers the
security forces that was no joke and the
lessons it was
the movement was committed to
non-violence but it's worth remembering
that southern black blacks did carry
guns just for survival they were living
an environment where they could be
murdered at any time so a lot of them
had guns and they some of the armed
farmers and counts people did provide
some degree of limited degree of
protection to the nonviolent civil
rights activists but there was a group
called the Deacons black men who had
guns who were in the background offering
some limited degree of protection to the
civil rights activists but the movement
itself was a major triumph of
non-violence and the lessons that from
that or several nonviolent protests can
succeed under specific kinds of
circumstances they first try to appeal
to the humanity of the aggressors those
the violent forces that they're
confronting and secondly they have to
have support in the case of the civil
rights movement in the South there was
support from much of the population the
American population mostly in the north
and it's very strike one of the striking
lessons of the civil rights movement is
what happened when it began when it
moved from protesting racist sheriffs in
Alabama to trying to confront racism in
the north it was immediately destroyed
if you look at you listen to the
rhetoric on martin luther king day of
speeches the eloquent speeches it all
ends
his talk is I have a dream speech on at
the great march in washington northern
liberals were willing to accept that
they were willing to accept that
african-americans in the South should
have voting rights and they were willing
to condemn brutal racist police tactics
in the south at Martin Luther King's
career didn't end there right after that
he turned to broader issues to Urban
discrimination radical Urban
discrimination in Chicago northern city
he began dort right or he had began to
oppose the war in Vietnam pretty openly
that was a my not very much of a
minority position at the time even
though the war had been going on for
years and South Vietnam burden
practically destroyed he he began to
organize it to try to organize a party
of the poor not just black poor but the
poor he he was assassinated it does i'm
sure you know in memphis tennessee when
he was taking for he was given he was
coming to support a sanitation worker
strike strike of poor working people who
were trying to unionize that's when he
was assassinated the night before his
assassination he gave another speech I
have a dream speech which is not
remembered the way the first one was
because it was directed against northern
racism he described himself with his
usual biblical rhetoric because like
Moses who can see the promised land
across the Jordan River but knows that
he will never get there however you the
people he's talking to if you keep
struggling you can get to the promised
land of
equal rights for all end to poverty and
oppression for all not just lacks but
blacks and whites alike then it was
assassinated there was to be he was
planning to lead a march from Memphis
Tennessee through the cities of the
South that had been the scenes of the
worst atrocities Selma Birmingham others
and they were pretty bad he was killed
but his wife Coretta King did leave lead
the march they got to Washington they
set up a tent city in Washington it's
called resurrection City Congress which
runs Washington very liberal Congress
the most liberal Congress in American
history they let them stay there for a
while then they sent in the police in
the middle of the night 2 a.m. to smash
up the tent city and drive them out of
town was the end of the poor people's
March well that's the part of Martin
Luther King's career that you don't hear
of and that carries very clear lessons
we are quite willing most of us to
condemn crimes that other people carry
out but it's a little harder to look
into the mirror as soon as that begins
to happen everything changes in fact
there's a kind of a principle which is
applied with near hundred percent
unanimity in international affairs
domestic affairs and so on the principle
is when there's some crime the the more
you can blame it on someone else and the
less you can do about it the greater the
protest in the outrage the more we share
responsibility and the more we can do
about it the less said about it it's
even up to the point of denial it works
the principle works with amazing
precision happening right now on the
front pages in fact but the case of
Martin Luther King is striking example
is so there are very definite lessons to
learn nonviolent protest if people have
sufficient courage integrity are willing
to face brutality maybe murder it can
succeed with support but that kind of
support is thin because it's almost
always based on this overriding
principle and until that principle is
overcome and that's something for us to
face we relatively privileged people
till that principle is face things like
those are going to continue thank you
thank you uh another question hi a wave
sociology students and we just wanted if
you could explain the function of
prostitution in society women enter into
prostitution because they have no
alternatives it's not a choice that most
women would choose to make if they had
the choice between that and becoming a
electrical engineer I say that because
of where I'm sitting at an engineering
school a professor at a university you
know working in financial industries and
so on and people should not be forced
into occupations that are a demeaning
that are oppressive that can be violent
that's a social illness it's not you
can't blame the women who do it but you
can blame the society that creates
circumstances in which those are the
options that
people took how important do you
consider the work of the ACM hey char in
the late 50s and early 60s to the
eventual success the birmingham campaign
well it was I mean the civil rights the
Birmingham was one of the centers of the
civil rights movement it was one of the
most vicious and oppressive of southern
jurisdiction the movement itself was
very substantially Christian and
character not just in Birmingham but the
Southern Conference Christian Leadership
was the main silver one of the main
civil rights groups the main adults it
will rights group alongside of a snake
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee but there was a strong
Christian element martin luther king
himself was basically a Christian
preacher was obvious from the rhetoric
that I just quoted also yes that was
undoubtedly a critical element and you
could see it if you were there i
remember in in a demonstration in
jackson mississippi once where we're
having to be there when demonstrators
were being beaten bloody in the streets
by the state police during the day
trying to escape to the steps of the
federal building unable to do it in the
evening they would get together in a
church by church singing hymns
reflecting creating a kind of sense of
community and mutual aid and support and
the developing the courage to go out and
do this and face the same offer if
accessions to the next day I'm not
religious myself but you couldn't help
being affected maybe even overcome by
the passion and the
significance of the religious ceremonies
that were undoubtedly having a major
impact on the people who are
participating under very onerous
conditions and that generalized through
the whole civil rights movement model
incidentally snake which was the cutting
edge of the civil rights movement
Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee though they were not that may
have been individuals of religious but
it was basically secular group we're
democratic decentralization create a
fairer more equal society or would it be
jeopardized and hijacked by the greed of
individuals well you'd you really can't
answer that in the abstract it depends
on other aspects of society so for
example suppose picsay the United States
today suppose you maintain the social
and economic institutions intact but you
had representative voting throughout the
country with democratic decentralization
of the political system it would
anything change eventually nothing
because the political system barely
functions popular attitudes have
virtually no influence on decisions
there's very good scholarship on this
one of the reasons people don't vote
voting is extremely low then in the last
election November the last election the
voting statistics are now out and it
turns out that in much of the country
voting participation was back to the
level of the early 19th century that's a
time when of course slaves didn't vote
women didn't vote white males didn't
vote unless they had met certain
property qualifications very narrow
voting base but participation was higher
than relative to the total population
than it is to
and there's a reason for that the people
they may not read political science
literature but the well aware that their
own opinions don't matter and if you
look at the actual literature what it
shows quite definitively is that a large
majority of the population maybe seventy
seventy-five percent lower lower three
quarters on the income scale of their
opinions have absolutely no effect on
policy their representatives just pay no
attention to them the radical
dissociation between opinion and policy
as you move up the scale you get a
little more influence but it's on to get
to the very top and top means like tenth
of a percent that you've basically see
policy made so if you had Democratic
decentralization in the political system
but maintain the narrow concentration of
economic and social power which of
course translates immediately into
political power then nothing that would
change on the other hand if he had true
democratic decentralization which means
democratic control of institutions
manufacturing institutions retail
commerce finance fall of that was under
Democratic control it will be different
society radically different take another
question yep
hi I was just one wondering about your
thoughts on the recent Ferguson protests
and if there were any similarities to
the civil rights movement of the 1960s
well that's I'm in Ferguson sparked it
that there were other cases very quickly
in cleveland in new york and there's no
Allah substantial protest against police
violence and racism which is just a
reflection of the society I mean it's
not that the police are particularly
brutal it's that's the way the society
treats african-americans male black
males basically take a look at
incarceration who's in prison
overwhelmingly black males not because
they commit more crimes because the
system is designed to criminalize black
life black male life the technique
that's you putting aside police violence
which just went reflection of it the the
current device for criminalizing black
society is what's called the drug war it
was actually initiated by Nixon but it
became it really took off under Reagan
Ronald Reagan was an extreme racist he
the drug war was designed so as to
target that mostly black males that it
goes from police procedures so for
example the police don't don't go into
white privilege silver suburbs to arrest
executives who are using cocaine in
their homes never dare to do that but
they do go into black ghettos and if
they find a fifteen-year-old kid with a
joint in his pocket he can be arrested
beginning with police procedures which
are not designed by the officers but
rather by their superior
earth ultimately their civilian
superiors all the way up to the planning
at the state and national level
beginning with police procedures up
through sentencing on through treatment
in the prison's on to the punitive
measures that are undertaken f if people
are released from prison right through
that whole system it's radically racist
and it ends up with a huge number of
black males in prison not because say in
the case of drugs not because they used
drugs more fact blacks and whites use
drugs about the same level but the
punishment incarceration driving out of
the society permanently even after they
get out all of that targets black males
this is by now black women to to an
extent and also Hispanics to a certain
extent but primarily african-american
males the further where this goes way
back in American history it's nothing
new you take a look at the history of
african-americans in the United States
the first slaves came about were brought
about 400 years ago to right where I'm
sitting Massachusetts that's 400 years
up until the Civil War of the vast
majority of blacks millions of them were
either killed on the Atlantic passage
were brought here as slaves and they
worked in slave labor camps the
plantations in the South were slave
labor camps caps where the character of
life would have impressed the Nazis
about the same as Nazi concentration
camps except for the gas chambers oh
there was massive torture use the
torture was very effective one of the
striking things about the slave labor
camps is that they were cotton picking
for sugar later
I'm picking the productivity increased
very rapidly productivity in the slave
labor camps increased more rapidly than
in industry and without any
technological innovations the only
technological innovation was the
bullwhip in the pistol but just by
torturing people more effectively they
were able to radically increase the
level of cotton production and that's
why you live in a wealthy country that's
the reason that was the basis for the
economic development not only of the
United States but of England the textile
mills of the Commerce the finance that's
the origins of the Industrial Revolution
and it was based on extremely cheap
cheap cotton extracted in slave labor
camps by torture the modern economy is
based on it do we pay attention to that
fact think about it it's as I say it's
it's not just textiles it's everything
that grows out of it including the
financial system which developed out of
it the manufacturing system the big the
biggest Mills for a long time we're
manufacturing developed with textile
mills there's all kind of spin-offs and
the other kind of manufacturing and it
is completely accurate to say that the
modern economy the advanced economy is
weighs very heavily on slave labor camps
where people were tortured brutally to
increase productivity well that was up
until the civil war Civil War formally
ended that and for about ten years there
was a period in which blacks had a
limited opportunity to enter the
mainstream society in 1877 10 years
after the Civil War a compact was
reached between the North and the South
and essentially the south former slave
states were permitted to do whatever
they liked federal troops withdraw in
federal supervision with
withdrawn they could reconstruct the old
system and the way they did it are we
okay can you can you hear me yep yeah
okay there was a break the way they did
it was exactly the pretty much the way
it's being done now a decision was made
thousands of decisions all over the
south to criminal on his black life so
for example if a black man was standing
at a street corner he could be arrested
for vagrancy and charged as a a fine of
ten dollars which he couldn't pay so
he'd have to go to prison and then the
debts big build-up be may end up in
prison for life if a black man is
accused of looking the wrong way at a
white woman he can be accused of
attempted rape then he gets a much more
severe sentence pretty soon they had a
large part of the black male population
in prison and that became prison labor
prison labor is slave labor in fact from
the point of view of the owners say
Andrew Carnegie the great philanthropist
to develop the first billion-dollar
steel industry a large part of it using
slave labor in southern prisons from the
point of view of the owner that's a
terrific labor force if you own slaves
there your capital you have to maintain
them if the slaves are in prison you
don't have to maintain them the taxpayer
maintains them you just get them as
slaves and furthermore they can't
they're not going to unionize they can't
protest they can only do their work the
part that's kind of familiar to us is
the chain gangs in the south where
chained criminals were picking cotton
and so on pretty much as they were
during the slavery but it was
manufacturing to and mining a good part
of the American industrial revolution
after the
in the late nineteen 19th early 20th
century was based on essentially slave
labor and in prisons that went on until
the Second World War 1939 wartime
industry was beginning to develop and
there was a need for a local free labor
so this system kind of declined and
there was a period roughly the 1940s
into the 1970s when african-americans
had a again a limited opportunity to
enter into the mainstream society so say
a black worker could get a job at a
unionized auto plant and the word unions
in those days now they're mostly
destroyed that meant that he could have
a pretty decent job you know degree of
security by a small home maybe buy a car
get his kid to go to college that lasted
for a couple decades then comes the war
on drugs which is reconstituting the
system of the late 19th century
so-called Jim Crow system and in fact is
also being used for slave labor that's
the history of african-americans from
the first slaves around 1620 up until
today you take a look at police violence
and Ferguson it doesn't it's not a it's
not coming from nowhere it's coming from
a rich background of extreme white
racism which is in fact the basis for
your privilege and my privilege that's
how our economies developed and became
rich and productive and now we can kind
of look at police violence and Ferguson
and say look how awful they are but
again it's one of these cases we're
looking into the mirror doesn't hurt we
have time for questions
in your opinion who would you say was
the most influential spokesman of the
civil rights movement well the civil
rights movement worse the person who's
most famous is Martin Luther King justly
very important person but remember that
he is voice as a spokesman ended with
the march on washington in in the early
60s he continued to be a civil right
spokesman but his voice was still you
hear and read very little about what he
did during the last phase of his life
when he was seeking to organize a poor
people's movement for justice and equity
for the general population that's gone
others have continued and there's no one
of his renowned but people continue to
struggle for a civil and human rights in
fact the techs say the most effective
civil rights movement but developed in
the 1960s had nothing to do with Martin
Luther King it's the women's movement it
began the first signs of it were
beginning of course it goes way back
historically but it really began to take
off lily in the 1970s and it had an
enormous impact I don't know what this
college was like 50 years ago if it even
existed but if you take a look around
the room now it's about half women my
own University MIT is the same about
half women when I got here in the mid
1950s there were no women maybe two or
three women faculty is scattering of
women students but basically no women
was a male University and that's changed
dramatically throughout the whole
society that's a real achievement of
civil rights it also came from
nonviolent protest not it had its
spokespersons you know them some of them
eloquent but the main thing was just
plenty of activism on the ground
consciousness-raising groups actions
undertaken to demand rights and finally
broke through in the United States just
to give an example when the US was
founded it took over British common law
of course the law that you read in
Blackstone according to British common
law women were not persons they were
property a woman was the property of her
father handed over to her husband the
debates and the Constitutional
Convention about women vote should women
have the right to vote one of the
arguments against it was that it would
be unfair to unmarried men because a
married man would have two votes since
obviously the property votes the way its
owner votes also women were denied the
right to vote the women were denied the
right to serve on federal juries juries
are supposed to be juries of your peers
goes back to Magna Carta and women
weren't peers because they weren't
persons in fact it wasn't until 1975
that women were granted the right to be
jurors and federal juries that means
recognized to be peers to be actual
persons that's a pretty significant
civil rights achievement in fact the
greatest one that came out of the 1960s
activism it didn't really barely began
in the 60s took off in the 70s and
there's a good deal more gay rights for
example are completely different than in
the past that one of as I'm sure you
know one of England's great war heroes
also one of the great mathematicians of
the 20
century Alan Turing was basically
murdered by the British government in
nineteen i think was nineteen fifty four
when they were going to cure him of his
disease of homosexuality and forced
treatments on him which led to his death
he was the person who was responsible
for breaking the German codes in the
early 40s which saved Britain from
destruction from bombing he and as I say
was like greatest mathematicians of the
20th century founded modern computer
science among other things he was
murdered by the British government for
the crime sacred homosexuality just I
think last year the year before was the
centenary of his birth and the Prime
Minister Cameron was asked whether he
could commute the sentence of course
he's long dead but could he receive a
posthumous pardon and the Prime Minister
refused he said he broke the laws of
England and you can't be pardoned for
that he broke the laws of England by
being a homosexual so he was murdered
well that's not that far in the past and
though it's still happening as Cameron's
comments indicated it's vastly changed
it's another achievement of civil rights
and there are others but the worst ones
the crime of slavery and and its impact
on the black communities of much of the
world primarily the united states that
remained remains we have all over the
United States you focus small towns even
you have Holocaust museums you have
courses in elementary school on
Holocaust Studies you have Holocaust
Studies departments in the Universities
try to find a Museum of African slavery
or courses on what I just described the
history of african-americans the
background for the kinds of things you
see in Ferguson try to find that you
won't similarly try to find museums of
the other major prime of American
society and remember that's Britain that
means British colonists the other major
crime extermination of the indigenous
population virtually nothing again the
same principle that I mentioned before
the Holocaust was somebody else's crime
it wasn't a lot we could do about it so
huge outrage and memory and studies and
commemoration and so on these other
things are our crimes not only our
crimes but the basis for our wealth and
privilege which would not be forgotten
therefore you don't discuss them the
principle that I mentioned before
radical clarity okay our time is up and
thank you very much indeed now for a
very very stimulating and
thought-provoking a question and answer
session so thanks
well thank you all for coming be such a
great audience
