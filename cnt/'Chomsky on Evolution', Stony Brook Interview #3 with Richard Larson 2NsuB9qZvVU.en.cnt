hello we're here today with
internationally known MIT linguist noam
chomsky co-author of a recent science
article on the evolution of language
that article is entitled the Faculty of
language what is it who has it and how
did it evolve mr. Chomsky in your long
writings about the the nature of
language acquisition of language by
individuals has played an important part
in your thinking and you've commented on
it in in depth its nature and its
significance on the other hand the
acquisition of language by our species
seems to be a new topic for you one you
haven't talked about is in detail before
are you excited about this and give us a
little bit of background on your
engagement in the topic well it from my
point of view it became it's not lack of
interest it's just that I've never seen
anything that could be said about it
it's both too hard and too easy it's too
easy because they're so easy to make up
all sorts of possible scenarios in fact
just they come to mind instantly and a
lot of them are in the literature it's
too hard because there's no way to tell
whether any of them have any
plausibility little own or credibility
the problem has been my view has always
been to try to parcel out the topic in
such a way that at least parts of it can
be studied and that's essentially what
this is about actually doesn't say
anything about the evolution of language
it just says here's a way of looking at
the topic with various components some
of which can be investigated by the
comparative method which is about the
only successful method some of which
might be very significant if certain
ideas about the nature recent ideas
about the nature of language are correct
so if it turns out that in fact to some
in some interesting sense the
computational system of the core
computational system has optimization
properties
in particular that it's something like
an optimal solution to the problem of
linking interface conditions if that's
true then there are many avenues to
explore that could turn out to be
interesting they're kind of barely
mentioned at the end so there are other
optimization strategies and processes
known in nature and it's conceivable
that this could be one of them in which
case you know matic things as remote as
say insect navigation or foraging
strategies or the distribution of the
structure of the circulatory system
which optimizes in a certain sense could
there an out to be irrelevant to the
evolution of language the interface
systems it's possible that he hears
mostly mark Hauser and comes the Fitch's
work I don't know anything about it that
they've done a lot of work on primates
and even beyond trying to investigate
what extent sensory motor systems and
the harder question conceptual systems
in other primates might have or beyond
in fact might have homologous it might
be homologous to humans and some respect
but that is a topic that at least can be
studied by the comparative approaches
and if it's true that the fundamental
nature of language involves interface
conditions which are mostly there
independently a language maybe they were
partly selected for language functions
if it involves interface conditions and
something like optimization relative to
interface conditions which is a highly
speculative idea if that's true then at
least you can break the problem into
parts that can be addressed in ways that
are
to some extent understood you seem to
arrange your the proposal that you make
in the paper between two different poles
of thinking about this topic one is that
human language is basically analogous to
things found in the animal world maybe
more difficult more complex but not
different in kind and the other is that
it's completely unique a completely
unique human adaptation but your paper
attempts to steer a third course between
the two of them says yeah says that
about that well if this is all based on
the assumption that it makes sense to
think of language in terms of some kind
of optimization of linking of interface
conditions if that basically mmm you
know if these ideas are wrong then it's
not going to go anywhere but if there's
something to those ideas then both of
the properties that you mentioned could
turn out to be correct that is the
interface conditions could be have
homologous structures and other say
other primates but the linking seems to
be human unique and the question is
where that comes from and if it turns
out to be an optimization process their
ways of thinking about it that don't
involve the you know selectional leap
that seems almost impossible to explain
see more about that in the in the paper
you describe the the interface
conditions as conditions interfaces
between a cognitive system cognitive
intentional system and a sensory motor
system with natural language forming a
kind of bridge drawn between them at
various points that's what seems to be
lacking in the most in the cousins
you know other primates they don't seem
that they have no technique of what's
lacking and this has been observed for a
long time as something like
a recursive procedure that will permit
the that will generate sound meaning
pairs and some sense over an infinite
range well if the sound meaning parts
are the interface conditions and the
recursive procedure is an optimization
procedure then you've broken the topic
of evolution of language into
compartments each of which can be
investigated I'm in the most of their
work is on the sensory motor systems
which they argue really are do have that
don't have any unique any particular
unique adaptation in humans not at least
not a major one on the conceptual
intentional side it's much more
questionable they're questions of how
animal systems signal and how human
thought has expressed raised many
questions not at all clear that the
human mode of referring to things is at
all related to animal signaling that
seems have quite different properties
and that's just the beginning you know
then you go into more complicated things
like you know quantifier structures and
so on and so forth
that we don't even raise but the the
real innovation in Homo sapiens appears
to be the overwhelming one that is the
recursive process of linking two kinds
of information one kind that feeds
sensory motor systems the other that
interacts with conceptual intentional
systems the human sight that the human
language makes the bridge makes contact
with the sensory motor system and you
said that has analogs in the animal
world is that really even a homologs
which is different yeah analogs are all
over the but
the question is whether there are really
homologous structures you might trace
back to pre you know before the split
between hominids and other primates you
know five million years ago or something
like that is that the idea then that the
the gestural system maybe of apes is the
point at which like well they're right
now actually they're talking about
things like the the articulatory and
perceptual systems the gestural systems
is a different question I mean they're
human gestural systems could turn out to
be like other primate gestural systems
but isn't that a crucial component I
mean what we know for example about
natural language is that this is a point
that you've emphasized in other
interviews is that it's not essentially
vocal that is its vocal but it's also
gestural given the existence of sign
line that raises new dimensions which we
don't go into there but is there
anything because I haven't really been
explored enough I mean to what extent
are the the the gestural systems
involved in sign and the gestural
systems that we otherwise use as seem to
be dissociated actually this has been
demonstrated pretty persuasively I think
in acquisition of sign that there's some
dramatic cases like Laura patitos work
on the pronoun v' the use of pronouns
first and second person pronouns and
sign and spoken language I mean there's
this basically it works like this
there's a stage in spoken language
development normal what we're used to in
which children invert you and I so
they'll say pick you up
meaning pick me up they regard you as
they hear you as referring to themselves
so they think that's who it is and that
your eye is referring to that person
over there so they think that's who it
is
so they interchange and then after a
while this goes away it's a kind of a
pretty standard presumably maturational
process that goes on well Laura
Patito found the same thing happens in
sign at about the same age and there
it's quite striking because I and you
were
iconic use this as that and the infants
at the same age act counter iconically
so it's not just abstract you know you
and I interchange but that and that
interchanges furthermore it turns out
that at the same period they use this in
this for pointing correctly so they have
the pointing system iconically and they
have the linguistic system which is
counter iconic at the same stage at
which spoken language children are
inverting the pronouns so it looks that
kind of evidence seems to suggest that
gestural systems and linguistic systems
even though they may have the exact same
motor element involved in them are just
different systems
they also seem probably to be neroli
dissociated in the sense you could do
brain studies that show they're
activating different areas it looks like
it yeah in fact this began this is work
done by ursula bellugi and it claimed
and others at Salk Institute I was just
been going on for I guess about twenty
years now they discovered to everybody
surprised that for signers
this they began with aphasia and studies
in fact most of it still is aphasia that
for signers the language faculty is
still left hemisphere dominant and it
had been suspected it's probably right
hemisphere dominant because it's visual
but it turns out to be look very much
like spoken language despite the
difference of modality and they've also
discovered something beyond that
I'm discover as strong these are hard
things to do but they have evidence that
for both the spoken language and sign
local analytic computation like sentence
structure is left hemisphere
specialized but global computation like
discourse structure is right hemisphere
localized for both sign and unspoken
know that Lisa their evidence looks like
imaging studies are just barely
beginning that should it said more light
on it does that provide as it were
neurological evidence that the sentence
is of a special sort of unit for
linguistic computation it's not
paragraphs are not just big sentences
provides you no evidence to the this all
pretty weak evidence because very little
is understood about it but it looks like
that and going back to the original
question this does raise serious issues
about the ways in which the sensory
motor system imposes critical conditions
on the operations of the computational
system because it seems it's getting to
be more and more plausible to believe
that human language is not
modality-specific even though it's
overwhelmingly in the speech hearing
mobility but that would put serious
constraints on our ability to figure out
when natural language evolved for
example there's at least a two decade
old research program by Philip Lieberman
Jeffery late men collaborators that has
attempted to look at the comparative
anatomy both of extant primates their
vocal tract anatomy and also reconstruct
the soft tissue anatomy of extinct
hominids on the idea that basically if
they couldn't make the sounds they
didn't have the language you know that's
pretty controversial I mean it looks as
though this is again I don't enter into
this I don't anything about it but the
Hauser and Fitch both are very skeptical
about that as our others it seems that
some of the properties that they found
are all over the
I'm a kingdom and that it may be that
hundreds of thousands of years ago the
hominids from which we were ultimately
this ended had the what looked like the
physical capacities to produce language
but your point is correct if the spoken
if the speech hearing modality is not
critical to it this would be significant
but not overwhelming you know like
another organism could you sign yeah
exactly I could have because you were
there yeah yeah yeah but that does raise
the question about the look a search for
homologous structures in the sensory
motor system it should be extended and
we all know that to asking whether what
is the character of the gestural systems
that are used for language as distinct
from the gestural systems which are
physically identical but that are part
of a different system gesturing how's
that possible I mean how could it be
possible to have two overlapping I'll
take the point in case and it's the most
dramatic example but there it's highly
dramatic because we think I mean our
intuition about sign language obviously
completely mistaken is that it is
somehow iconic yeah well you know it
somehow it is like you know when you
when you're a signer we'll set points in
visual space and refer back to them it's
the anaphora system but it does go
through the period periods which
indicate that the that it is that even
the physically identical gestures are
somehow different if there are
linguistic and non-linguistic and the
neurological evidence indicates the same
in fact if you look more deeply at sign
language it supports the same
conclusions I mean patitos results are
particularly dramatic because it's a you
know because of the counter iconic usage
and the parallel to normal to the normal
acquisition for speaking hearing
children so it's but this is all fairly
recent work you know it's kind of
developing fast and should sit alone it
could turn out that the major
constraints interface constraints for
the computational system are on the
conceptual intentions side which makes
the problem very hard because that to
study that independently of language is
very difficult I mean it's hard to study
thought except through the medium of
language which will beg the questions
how in principle could we even approach
that question well you can do it I mean
there's studies of what are called the
Apes theory of mind or the infant the
pre-linguistic infants theory of mind I
mean at what point do were due for
example as a factual question do say
other primates attribute something like
and beliefs to you know their other
members of their species can they
tribute false beliefs for example and
they're all ways of studying this that's
just some interesting recent published
work reviewing it looked by and in David
Premack just came out Chas reviews a lot
of the material and this thing's called
the original intelligence so the major
contained disability might be on that
side rather than the sensory motor
system unless something can be learned
about the I mean by now a lot is known
about the perceptual of the auditory and
articulatory apparatus what much less is
known about the systems of gesture that
are used in sign what what if there are
structural properties you know how are
they distinguished from other gestures
and so on but it but undoubtedly there's
going to be something to be said about
that and that may impose the kinds of
constraints that are similar to the ones
we're more familiar with from
articulatory and auditory systems and in
those systems
there's reasonably good evidence I think
again for me this is second area
only know it indirectly but looks to me
like there's plausible evidence that the
systems are not in any crucial sense
human-specific you make a startling
suggestion at the end of this article
that even the recursive procedures the
what you call the narrow Faculty of
language the sort of core of it
specifically understood might actually
have been adapted or accepted co-opted
from another system having to do with
navigation
what's that idea you know this goes back
to old ideas I mean it's everyone knows
that if you want to if you taken a
mature organism say you know a person or
a worm or anything you pick and you ask
about the factors that lead it to be
what it is there are many different
factors I mean one is whatever effect
experience it another is what there's an
expression of the genes a third factor
is how the laws of nature work I mean
the the laws of nature work in ways
which permit certain kinds of
development not others and exactly what
the effect is of those constraints is
not too well understood it's a hard
problem actually the problem during work
done for a good part of his life classic
work is by Darcy Thompson there's more
recent work by others but there are many
properties of organisms that seem to
just be consequences of the way the laws
of nature work which is you know in a
sense it's a truism but to find the
effect of those is hard well we're
talking about computational systems and
computation would the laws of nature
operate in these well one might expect
that the way they work is by imposing
conditions of efficient computation some
sort of optimization conditions and
things like that are found throughout
nature so insect navigation seems to
have optimization properties as I
mentioned foraging seems to optimize
there's recent work suggesting that
by Christopher journey at the University
of Maryland that the arrangement of the
neural systems least in simple animals
he suggests young may not be genetically
programmed but just be what he calls
minimization of wire lengths I mean
using the same procedures that engineers
use when they try to get the best
possible transistor you know you just
make that what he calls the best of all
possible brains you know just sort of
turns out that way the circulatory
system seems to work similarly it looks
like there's some optimization in the
way it sort of scatters around the body
and it's possible that these things are
just deep natural laws and somehow or
other they you know here here's the step
that took place is to the step of
linking the external conditions and you
know what could have happened is that as
soon as that step was taking let's link
them it immediately became optimal and
now comes the linguistic questions to
what extent can we show that the actual
linguistic systems do have optimal
properties that's what the work in the
minimalist programs involved with and
that's how the issue you know that's how
at least for me and for I think my
colleagues the question of at bringing
the evolution of language to a stage
where parts of it cannot be investigated
that's where it sort of comes together
so recursion basically provided the link
but then there's an issue of optimizing
the character of the link right so for
example if the character of the link is
the way I personally assumed that the be
say 10 years ago extent say the article
that Howard Liao's nickname wrote
summarizing what we thought was the
state of the art if it's like that it's
very far from optimal I mean over all
sorts of properties in the system
different levels that aren't interface
levels strange conditions you know all
sorts of things and if that's the way
the system actually works
looks very far from optimal but if you
can demonstrate that those empirical
assumptions were wrong
that there really are no levels other
than the interface levels and that the
operations do reduce and some
interesting sense to the one operation
that comes free in a recursive system
namely complaining together take through
things you form to make a bigger one you
know that comes free and it can be
internal or external that yields what we
call movement in a automatic way and if
you can show that that works by optimal
conditions like some of these pro gold
theories well okay then you're on it it
is a huge empirical question but there's
an impetus task and it's a question how
far you can carry it out to see if you
can show that all of the technology
that's used in descriptive and
explanatory work in linguistics can be
shown to be an artifact a reflection of
optimal computational procedures it's a
huge task but there's been nothing least
to me some significant progress in it to
the extent that that can be carried out
you have a picture of the evolution of
language which is to oversimplify it as
we do there it would look like like the
following and this is surely
oversimplified the interface systems are
they're pretty much independently of
language and you find them something
like them at least in other organisms
and you can study their their evolution
by usual methods comparative methods
some where comes the the step of saying
okay let's link these then automatically
comes optimization of the linkage which
is the recursive system that
meets optimal conditions and then you
have this basic core of human language
and may not have changed I mean that's
you know like the ideal how close you
can get to that there's a good question
but if it's correct then to get back to
your original question couldn't well be
that the things is that look as remote
as insect navigation illustrate the
principles that showed up in optimizing
the link I see it wasn't the link itself
that wasn't right but the authorization
comes from somewhere but you know that's
the way evolution works I mean if you
look at systems that respond to light
like the eye or maybe in photo traffic
plants and so on they got to come from
somewhere and it seems that where they
came from was some stochastic process
that introduced into a cell a class of
molecules by accident you know that
which happened to convert light into
chemical energy reduction molecules when
they get into a cell then you've got the
basis for all systems that respond to
light but how that happened as you know
it's not a wasn't by selections just
something that happened and it could be
that the linkage is something that
happened once it's established you turn
to the laws of nature to determine how
it should work there are a lot of
puzzles you know on the question of not
only how it happened but when it
happened yes every example in the
evolution of our own species Homo
sapiens there's a great mystery server
the surrounding a certain kind of
explosive big bang development that
occurred about 30,000 years ago we know
that you know modern humans came in
about a hundred thousand years ago
coexisted with other species like
Neanderthals for maybe sixty thousand
years and then suddenly there was this
very dramatic change apparently in human
culture and some have speculated that it
was the origin of language the only 30
thousand years ago that did it does that
seem remotely plausible
I mean there's a lot of evidence that
you know roughly in that range maybe 30
50 thousand years something like that
there was an explosive change in the
degree of inventiveness of tools of
different kinds of symbolism even of
this magnificent artwork that you see in
Lesko and so on but there's no evidence
as far as I know for any physiological
changes right during the first 50
thousand years and it looks as if
contemporary humans are genetically
almost identical no matter when they
separated from the original you know
small breeding group maybe around a
hundred thousand years ago so it's a
fair question what happened in those
first the first fifty thousand years for
many mysteries but more than that though
it would suggest that after that link
was drawn we were in some sense
genetically distinct from other members
of our own species which would make it
unless you know unless the fact I mean
there's another possible and there's a
whole total speculation here's a
possible scenario around the hundred
thousand years ago that was all sitting
there in the brain but then and you know
establishing the link could have been
like making the first tools you know I
mean just just happens I mean the same
side to sort of question arises about
when early hominids began flaking stones
to make tools you know how they figure
it out I mean once it was done had an
enormous effects on the species it
opened up new sources of protein and so
on and so forth and you know all sorts
of affect but it happened somehow you
know we don't know how and the the
ability to do it had already been there
before it happened obviously otherwise
it couldn't happen now it's possible
that the ability to make the link was
there say a hundred thousand years ago
and it just varies maybe independently
and various separated groups somehow it
happened like tool-making and once it
happened you've got language and then
they're all going to look alike
because they're all coming from the same
genetic base so it lay fallow for 60,000
years yeah just how long did the
tool-making play film maybe millions of
years for all we know hmm
and in fact anything you look at you did
the same question it's going to arise
and it's kind of striking to us because
we think about language you can really
ask the same questions about every stage
of tool production or any other
cognitive capacity well professor
Chomsky thank you very much we're now
gonna take some questions from our
studio audience please step to the mic
and ask your question you seem to be
substituting the word optimization of
the linking process or something like
that
for the process that others would say is
guided by a natural selection more or
less and those others would say that
natural selection is or someday will be
adequate to explain the development of
the human Faculty of language so I'm
just wondering if you can explain why
you think the natural selection isn't
adequate or isn't an appropriate term to
use here and how it falls short as an
explanatory device well I don't see any
reasonable selectional procedure the
mechanism that could have led to the
development of an optimal linkage and
there are many aspects of organic growth
where we know that selection is just not
the factors that are involved so if you
look at say symmetry of this there's a
lot of symmetrical structures in
organism design there are there are many
as I mentioned optimization processes
that takes what take place that takes a
the way proteins fold something as
simple as that it's not a matter of
natural selection that's just the way
the world works and the way the world
works affects the way organic entities
work so it's just an empirical and
there's nothing but you know the
everyone agrees that natural selection
an important factor in evolution but to
try to sort out its the effects of that
factor is extremely hard even in the
most elementary systems we know anything
about because there are all sorts of
other factors like chemical and physical
laws and maybe mathematical principles
of organization so there's no kind of
you know a prior I stand that you have
to take and then argue against the
question is just to discover what it is
and here are some suggestions as to what
it could be if someone has some
selectional ideas fine look at those but
but they don't have any particular
priority I'm a biologist and I should
the question I have a sort of a
follow-up to this one when a biologist
looks at something as complex as the FLN
the recursion device ostensibly is the
first question to questions you ask is
what is it for and what is it from that
is what it evolved from and you
suggested that maybe it didn't evolve or
at least that's not the right way to
look at it it evolved but the way it's
with hoppitty molecules getting into the
vault
so its properties in other words on that
view are more contingent on its function
it's it's contemporary function rather
than its evolutionary origin even that's
misleading because there's a factual
question about what the function is
under the usual assumption about
language has been that its function is
to facilitate communication right this
I've never believed that and this point
of view takes a very different approach
it says the function if you want to use
the worth of language is to link
interface conditions and when you look
here it's just an empirical question and
when you look closely at the structure
of language I could mention some cases I
think what you find is that the
computational system is optimal is
apparently optimal with regard to
linking the interface but it's very non
optimal with regard to communication I
see so but I actually have a specific
question about its origin so it there
was a case to be made that animal Minds
evaluate contingent
circumstances and control their most
purposeful motion in response to those
that those systems are in fact
hierarchically nested in combinatorial
there's actually an argument to be made
that that's true that looks remarkably
like the FLN that looks remarkably like
the recursion device and if that's true
in turn that it means that the property
of the recursion device perhaps
including some that looks suboptimal for
its function or in fact like the bones
in a bird's wing they are historical
accidents rather than functional
properties of the system could you
perhaps explore that just for a moment
whether you like or dislike that is the
difference between hierarchical
structure and recursion there's all
kinds of the texts of the birds and you
know the bones and I got five fingers
randomized three you know and so on
that's hierarchical structure but it's
not recursion there's no recursive
process that gives you an arbitrary
number of fingers each stage of which
has particular significance
remember this recursion is not like you
know walking I mean you take one step
and then in two steps and then the
three-strikes every stage in the process
has particular significance determine
significance at two interfaces and
that's something completely different
than hierarchical structure yeah I was
actually referring to things like
Biederman's view of perception for
example that it's that it's inherently
combinatorial in hierarchically nested
do you like yeah that's fine I mean in
fact maybe the we could have gone into
this fact I mentioned it that the could
be that the recursive systems and not
only maybe they're connected with insect
whatever's involved in insect navigation
but they could also be involved with
what a lot of perceptual psychologists
call the rules of vision you know the
rules that make you see some object some
presentation as a three-dimensional
object in motion there's a very pretty
well understood but now computational
procedure that determines that from very
few presentations like three estes copic
presentations that get you to see a
rigid object in motion okay there's some
kind of principles involved in that and
it wouldn't be outlined
to assume that those were tall rules of
seeing you know are similar in some way
to whatever's going on here yeah I think
this didn't come from nowhere
you know the question is where it came
from and in my view and exciting and not
implausible conclusion is that it just
comes from the way nature works with
computational systems and therefore you
going to find it all over the place yes
if there's there's one more question I'm
really against as a biologist struck by
why linguists are I'm not sure the word
is hostile but apparently indifferent to
this question of what language is for a
biologists look at that and say that
look at language look at its
sophistication and it's its Paley's and
watch on a heath it's a complex thing
that can only ultimately be produced as
a result of its adaptive consequences
the only apparent adaptive consequences
are the ones we think that leap
immediately to mind that is exchange of
information cooperative change that's
what leaps to mind it's just a mistake
I'm just look at the I mean what if you
want to well it leaps to the mind of
almost every biologist in the world I've
ever say and the notion of function is a
very you know loose and vague notion we
all know that so what's the function of
the skeleton I mean just to keep you
from falling into a puddle on the ground
there is it the store calcium or if it's
properly considered is not an arrow what
to ask what the function of a birdwing
is is a well focused question maybe but
the you know if you actually look at the
history of it's not so well for the
evolution of it it's quite complicated a
lot of exaptation and so on and so forth
but the notion of what a function is is
a very vague notion however what is
usually assumed plausibly is you can get
some guide to what the function is by
looking at the characteristic use ok
well let's take the characteristic use
of language characteristic use of
languages for the thought not for
communication almost all language use
close to 100% is internal my
understanding was that that's
controversial that is in particular that
most thought is in fact not lling oh
that's another question yes there could
be plenty of thought that's not
linguistic but I'm asking a different
question what's the use of language
statistically speaking it's almost all
internal if you want to check
just introspect for a couple hours but
that's bait but that's based on that's
based on introspection I could make my
own observation but introspection is a
kind of observation I mean if we had an
outside way of looking at introspection
we'd find the same but an equivalently
plausible interpretation of that is that
that appears to be true subjectively
because the purpose of language is to
prepare our thoughts for the ultimate
purpose of social communication control
thoughts and say this if you want but
that's now we're off way and I know
those are equal desert competing models
should be set up in desk yet all we know
is all we know is the following that the
overwhelming use of language close to a
hundred percent is internal and when you
think about what that internal stuff is
it has very little to do with
communication like you can spend half
your life obsessing because somebody
criticized you ten years ago you don't
expect to communicate it but that's kind
of thing that was on your mind all the
time oh you can you know you can think
about ostensively you were preparing for
a man for an invert into meeting with
that person maybe maybe it's an argument
somebody died you know I mean it's just
not you know it's just factually
incorrect it's it's true arguable it's
true that look everything's arguable but
the overwhelming evidence is that
internal thought is playing some
function for us yeah you know planning
agonizing whatever we do it right and
some tiny piece of it ends up as being
communication incidentally plenty of
other things are involved in
communication too now it could you can
always make up a story that's one of the
things about evolutionary fairytale
manufacturing or about all of science
they're nuts they're about stories yes
they're not testable sorry soul Alliance
just so stories are particularly
prominent in this domain but if you want
to use plausible arguments but like
characteristic use tells you something
about function then I think you'd have
to say that the function of language in
this loose sense is a forethought some
of it ends up being communication very
small parts in fact even the part that
is externalized
it's communication I made a very odd
sense I mean like if you meet somebody
it's very hard for people to be next to
each other and not to talk to each other
yeah it's kind of you know it's like
dogs looking at you know in others I you
just have to talk to each other
so if you meet some you're standing with
somebody a bus stop it's just
uncomfortable if you're not talking to
them so you talk to them about the
weather or the baseball game or so
that's not communication that's just
it's sometimes called fatik
communication it's just a way of
establishing human relations social
human but that's not communication in
the sense of transmitting information or
anything
if by communication you just mean
interacting with other people yeah okay
then it would turn out if you do it
descriptively I think it would turn out
like this overwhelmingly language is
internal I mean it's literally close to
a hundred percent
some of it is externalized of the part
that's externalized a lot of it is just
fatik communication I mean we want to be
part of a group or we don't want to feel
hostile to each other like right you
don't look at it personally you don't
this like gaze is always off to the side
or you stay at a certain distance from
somebody that's rightly a lot of it just
needs to be like that and some very
small part of it is communication in
some independent sense of the word
communication say well you can make up a
story saying that it's that very small
part that drives the system but we have
no evidence for it furthermore if you
look at the mechanics of the system now
we're getting into more technical
aspects I think you can show that a lot
of the mechanics of the system are badly
designed for communication and
well-designed for linking the interfaces
actually one important asset is which is
if you if you if any of you are writing
parsing programs you know programs where
you're trying to do automated parsing
there's one overwhelming problem that
you always face and that is a word comes
along like a wh work you know what or
something like that and you know because
of the way language works if there's
going to be it's going to be linked to
some position in the sentence
but that position has to be not heard to
get so you have the problem of taking
word who and figuring out what
unexpressed there's no space there's no
break there's no nothing but what point
in the utterance is it connected with
just think how easy it would be if you
repeated it so if you didn't say what
did you see but what did you see what
okay then the problem is trivial however
that's computationally more difficult if
you look at the way our beliefs about
the computational systems if they are
recursive is in the way we think that
would involve more computation for
linking the interfaces so here's a
pretty striking case and they're quite a
lot more where the system seems to be
mechanically designed so that it reduces
computation and increases the problem of
perception and I think there are a lot
of cases like this thank you thank you
it's very interesting to hear how
language may have evolved as a response
to the interface conditions between
intentionality and sensory motor systems
and so we've been talking about the past
hundred thousand thirty thousand
whatever in terms of our time course
what about the future are we done is the
language mechanism now finished is this
the masterpiece or are we are we going
to continue to adapt there's no relevant
evolution going on under some you know
in humans are changing all the time
different groups change but you know the
time scale is so small that the chances
of significant genetic change involving
something like the language faculty look
pretty marginal but even in another
hundred thousand years can you envision
you know so little is known about this
that you can say anything you like but
the chances I think most biologists
would agree that we're just talking
about much too small a time scale so
everyone will speculate about the
furthermore all speculative research
over yet you know there's no I mean for
real changes to take place there have to
be separation of species they have to
stop that of sub species you have to
stop interbreeding for a long time
before speciation takes place real
genetic change
and how that happens is mostly
mysterious but it does seem to require a
pretty sharp break and interbreeding
right over a long stretch and that just
doesn't happen with humans right so
perhaps we could use simulation to try
to explore some of these ideas since we
really can't do it in the real world too
easily you could do simulation if you
understood the processes but since you
don't understand the processes you can't
do simulation Thanks
just a short question on the role of the
sensorimotor interface because in the
earlier discussion it seemed as though
what was crucial about the combinatorial
system and so on is that it made the
link between these two these these two
things and the output of the century
motor interface is as you have been have
been saying so some kind of some kind of
physical event either they had motion or
sounds or something and if language is
sort of making that link between say the
inside and in the physical world then in
the the response to the earlier question
about say the function of language as
being a vehicle for expressing thought
then that raises the question of what
what's the other half of the link in the
hundred percent use are almost hundred
percent use of language as you described
this what what is what's at the other
end of the link the other end of the
previous end of which is the conceptual
more depth conceptions interface
extremely interesting question and here
we don't have any anything the way of
solid evidence but we have a ton of
introspective evidence and that's
evidence all right introspect for a
while when you're talking to yourself
you're producing something which you
heat is the same as what you hear okay
yeah I mean and that's an enormous
amount of air life is producing to
ourselves something that in our head
sounds just like something we're hearing
here's a question which I don't know the
answer to and I don't think it's been
investigated do signers that what is
realized the next question well I don't
think it's been investigated but I would
assume so if that's the case then the
you know the internal part of the
sensory motor system is really
functioning okay so this I think it's
very hard to talk to yourself and not do
is like a chance of English right yeah
so this is this is music in fact you get
really earlier by yourself figure out if
the sentence is rhyme for example I mean
all things are easy in fact
automatic thanks very much okay
