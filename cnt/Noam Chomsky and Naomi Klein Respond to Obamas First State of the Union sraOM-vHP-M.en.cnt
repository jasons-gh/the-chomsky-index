the war and peace report
I am Amy Goodman were broadcasting from
Park City Utah from the headquarters of
the Sundance Film Festival the largest
festival of independent cinema in the
country in his State of the Union
address President Obama renewed his
criticism of the Supreme Court ruling
saying he hopes Congress passes
legislation quote that helps to lead to
to who that helps to right that's wrong
President Obama delivered his first
State of the Union address Wednesday
night the President did not lay out any
far-reaching new policies but instead
used the occasion to call on Congress to
move forward on issues already on the
agenda including economic recovery
health care reform and education a full
two-thirds of the president's 70 minute
address was devoted to the economy the
central theme of which was job creation
Obama talked through a series of steps
his administration hopes to take to aid
middle-class families and spur job
growth as expected Obama proposed a
three-year freeze on discretionary
government spending threatening to use
his veto to achieve it we are prepared
to freeze government spending for three
years spending related to our national
security
Medicare Medicaid and Social Security
will not be effective but all other
discretionary government programs will
like any cash-strapped family we will
work within a budget to invest in what
we need and sacrifice what we don't and
if I have to enforce this discipline by
veto I will I know that some in my own
party will argue that we can't address
the deficit or freeze government
spending when so many are still hurting
and I agree which is why this freeze
won't take effect until next year when
the economy is stronger
that's how budgeting works
but understand understand if we don't
take meaningful steps to rein in our
debt it could damage our markets
increase the cost of borrowing and
jeopardize our recovery all of which
would have an even worse effect on our
job growth and family incomes Obama went
on to courage action on energy
legislation linking success to the
creation of new jobs
he called for construction of new
nuclear power plants new offshore oil
drilling and passage of climate change
legislation Obama also challenged
Congress to supersede the Supreme
Court's ruling last week that allows
corporations to spend unlimited amounts
of money to elect and defeat candidates
the president also vowed to end the
military's Don't Ask Don't Tell policy
and urged Congress to pass legislation
opening the military fully to gay men
and lesbians for a response to President
Obama's first State of the Union address
were joined by two guests Noam Chomsky
joins us on the telephone from his home
in Massachusetts Chomsky is Institute
professor emeritus of linguistics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
where he taught for over half a century
he's the author of dozens of books
his most recent has failed States the
abuse of power and the assault on
democracy and joining us here in Park
City Utah is Naomi Klein journalist and
author her latest book is the Shock
Doctrine the rise of disaster capitalism
we welcome you both to Democracy Now
Noam Chomsky let's begin with you and
Massachusetts your response to President
Obama's State of the Union address one
doesn't expect to get much content from
a State of the Union address so and
there wasn't very much but that's normal
there were some proposals that made some
sense they weren't very definite but yes
it's a good idea to put Americans to
work building the infrastructure of
tomorrow railroads but not the
interstate highway system he said that I
don't think that's a good idea
the it's good
take 30 billion of the money Wall Street
banks have repaid and used it to help
community banks you've created the small
businesses and so on it it's true that
we should export more of our goods but
he didn't mention the way that has to be
done to do that namely lowering the
inflated dollar which is the financial
industries are gonna like so I don't
think it'll happen on freezing
government spending it's it's not it's
certainly not it's partially but not
totally in accord with the public will
so in fact the recent most recent poll
I've seen by pew on people's priorities
the highest per for increase in spending
by far the highest over two-thirds was
for education well that's being frozen
the next was veteran that Veterans
Benefits it's frozen the next is
healthcare which is partially froze
environmental protection not their
energy not their when you get down to
about I think the 11th or so you get the
military defense which is increasing
call it defense anti-terrorism defense
is 13th that's increasing so by and
large the priorities are I wouldn't say
the opposite of but not consistent with
the the spending block the it's a it's a
good idea to revitalize community
colleges to cut back to modify the
student loan program so it doesn't go
through banks the child care tax credit
makes some sense these are all it's also
good to reverse the Supreme Court ruling
which was a horrible ruling but he
didn't indicate how we should go ahead
with that and most of it is the kind of
rhetoric you expect in the State of the
Union address there were a few scattered
things like this Naomi Klein right now
you oh you just flew into Park City Utah
just before President Obama's State of
the Union address your reaction to it
well I mean we knew the spending freeze
was was going to come but to me it's
it's really striking I think what this
moment represents is the decision which
we all feared would come to pass the
bill on from saving Wall Street from
saving the elites of this country from
their own mass a bill worth trillions of
dollars to regular people in need in
this country I mean that's what a
spending freeze really means and we have
to look at it in the context of the the
debt crisis that is occurring at the
state level there's deficit huge
deficits being run up in California is
the most dramatic example but you're
already seeing how students are facing
things like 30 percent tuition increases
women's shelters are being closed so you
know when the president says freeze
spending that's saying to the states
we're not going to help you we're not
going to bail you out so this is really
this to me all comes back to the
top-down bailout that should never have
taken place in the first place the
decision that was made to throw the
taxpayer dollars at the banks at the
elites no scripts no strings attached
not to help the people losing their jobs
losing their homes and now now the bill
is being passed on because the debt
crisis the private sector debt crisis
which started this the the banks racking
up these huge debts was never solved it
was just moved it was just moved to the
public coffers and now Obama is is this
is a this is a Hoover move this is a
Herbert Hoover movement and I think we
have to say very clearly he is not FDR
and you know in the spirit
howard zinn who passed yesterday I keep
thinking of what would he say about
about the State of the Union and I think
he would tell us to refuse to pay this
bill that we needed debtors revolt well
as you said Naomi hours before President
Obama delivered his State of the Union
we learned the sad news that the
pioneering historian and professor
Howard Zinn had died he died at the age
of 87 of a heart attack Howard Zinn was
a frequent guest on Democracy Now he
last joined us at our old firehouse
studio in May at that time I asked him
for his assessment of President Obama I
wish President Obama would listen
carefully to Martin Luther King I'm sure
he pays verbal homage as everyone does
to Martin Luther King but he ought to
think before he sends missiles over
Pakistan before he agrees to this
bloated military budget before he sends
too
