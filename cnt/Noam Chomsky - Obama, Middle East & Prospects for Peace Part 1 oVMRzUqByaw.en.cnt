my name is Carl Hobart director of axis
of hope based right down comm ave here
at the school of education at boston
university and it's my pleasure to
introduce our guest speaker this evening
professor Noam Chomsky received his PhD
in linguistics in 1955 from the
University of Pennsylvania during the
years 1951 to 1955 professor Chomsky was
a junior fellow of the Harvard
University School of fellows the major
theoretical viewpoints of his doctoral
dissertation appeared in the monograph
syntactic structure in 1957 this formed
part of a more extensive work the
logical structure of linguistic theory
circulated in 1955 and published in 1975
professor Chomsky joined the staff of
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1955 and in 1961 was
appointed full professor in 1976 he was
appointed Institute professor in the
Department of linguistics and philosophy
for over 30 years professor Chomsky has
been a path-breaking linguist as well as
a provocative sometimes controversial
critic of American policies and politics
he has lectured at countless
universities here and abroad and he is
the recipient of numerous honorary
degrees and awards he is written and
lectured widely on linguistics on
philosophy on intellectual history on
contemporary issues on international
affairs and on u.s. foreign policy his
most recent books include a new
generation drawers lime new horizons in
the study of language in mind rogue
states 911 understanding power on nature
and language
pirates and emperors old and new Chomsky
on democracy and education imperial
ambitions failed States perilous power
interventions inside Lebanon what we say
goes conversations on us power in a
changing world the essential Chomsky and
Middle East illusions this forthcoming
book hopes and prospects will be
published in 2010 this evening lecture
by professor Chomsky is being
co-sponsored by the Boston University
School of Education under the sage
leadership of Dean hard and Coleman it's
also being sponsored by access of Hope a
nonprofit organization collaborating
with a school of education and dedicated
to improving the practice of
international conflict analysis
management and prevention in public and
independent high school and middle
schools in the US and around the world I
was introduced to professor Chomsky
years ago by a mutual friend as I
studied and became passionate about the
ideas of Martin Luther King jr. and
Gandhi and began to ponder the idea of
what I still to this day call
educational civil disobedience in US
schools over the years professor Chomsky
and I spoke about the preventive
medicine ideas of paul farmer and Jim
Kim Anna filia doll at partners in
health or the bricks and mortar of
schools that greg mortenson was working
on or the people's history of the United
States idea of mutual friend Howard Zinn
professor chomsky's advice and guidance
have helped us at axis of hope to
carefully craft in class intellectual
outward-bound conflict resolution
exercises to help us and foreign youth
learn to prevent rather than to
instigate conflict this is what we now
call it
civ hope preventive diplomacy professor
Chomsky also taught me to pursue what I
believed in with passion in this case
speaking out with a diplomatically
dissenting voice about the need to
create the future the prospect for
future peace by working tirelessly with
view youth specifically focused upon
teaching them trust compassion
transparency empathy and humility as
global citizens one child at a time to
professor Chomsky I am greatly indebted
as I use many of his sage ideas and
teaching a course called SED 214 here
educating global citizens focusing on
international conflict management and
prevention professor chomsky's lecture
this evening being filmed by bu
productions and then placed in the
archives for future viewing purposes is
entitled Obama the Middle East and the
prospects for peace he will speak for 30
minutes following this portion of this
lecture we will open the floor to
questions from the audience for one hour
until seven-thirty during the
question-and-answer there will be to
boston university students roving the
auditorium with microphones they will
bring the microphones to you so that you
may ask your questions please wait until
the microphone gets to you to ask those
questions one suggestion if you're in
the balcony and you want to come down
during that Q&A session please feel free
to walk down and have someone bringing a
microphone professor Chomsky it's an
honor to welcome you here to Boston
University this evening
oh well I think a reasonable way to
approach this network of problems is
from the perspective of preventive
diplomacy one of your main concerns
preventive diplomacy of course is also a
primary concern of the Security Council
of the United Nations and in fact it
recently passed an important resolution
on preventive diplomacy in the Middle
East the rest of it was flat late last
September's the 1887 if you want to look
it up on the Internet the resolution was
held here as a major victory for
President Obama and his ongoing conflict
with President Ahmadinejad and Iran and
actually if you read the resolution you
find that that's not entirely accurate
it had two provisions one of them was a
call for all states to refrain from the
threat or use of force in their
conflicts that merely reiterates the
leading a leading element of the United
Nations Charter article 2.24 which says
states should refrain from the threat or
use of force the second part of the
resolution 1887 called on all states to
resolve their conflicts within the
framework of the non-proliferation
treaty well who is that resolution
directed at nothing in the resolution
relates to Iran they are not engaging in
the threat or use of force and as far as
anyone knows they're staying within the
framework of the non-proliferation
treaty however the resolutions directly
is directed explicitly against the two
states
that consistently and regularly do
resort to force and the threat of force
namely the United States and Israel
those are the countries that carry out
aggression regularly and repeatedly that
invade other countries occupy other
countries impose terror and violence and
their unique and at respect furthermore
they are the countries that refuse to
accept the non-proliferation treaty now
of course the United States is a member
of the non-proliferation treaty but it
backs other countries that are not and
supports them in their violation of the
non-proliferation treaty there are three
countries that have never signed the
non-proliferation treaty all in release
one is Israel one is India South Asia
and the others Pakistan in all cases
they have developed their nuclear
weapons programs with us aid and support
and continued to and they all responded
to resolution 1887 as did the United
States itself in the case of India it
responded to the resolution calling for
states to settle to work within the
non-proliferation treaty by announcing
quite publicly that it can now produce
nuclear weapons with the same power
yield as those of the great powers as
those of the United States and it's been
able to develop its nuclear weapons
program in particular thanks to the
anglo the US Indian treaty which exempts
India from the provisions of US law and
the non-proliferation treaty that had up
till the signing this treaty barred
States developing nuclear weapons
outside the NPT barred them from having
gaining
aid in their nuclear weapons programs
now the u.s. of course says that its
nuclear aid India's out this for
civilian programs but of course it can
be transferred immediately to declare
weapons programs and doubtless that's
being done the treaty was signed pretty
openly there was no secrecy about this
in order to improve the opportunities
for US corporations to sell nuclear
equipment into India jet planes other
military weapons which would have been
barred under the provisions of preceding
US law so that's India now what about of
course as India expands its nuclear
weapons programs its offensive programs
Pakistan does as well can't keep up but
it devotes resources to expanding its
own offensive nuclear weapons capacity
that was developed primarily during the
1980s it's one of Reagan's Ronald
Reagan's many gifts to the world Reagan
the most vicious of Pakistan's many
military dictators zeal Huck was the
president and the 1980s after a military
coup and he was a real Reagan favorite
giving us was giving extensive aid to
Pakistan the pretext was the war in
Afghanistan the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan however the u.s. the CIA
station chief and Islamabad made it very
clear that the purpose of the aid is not
deliberate Afghanistan the US didn't
care about that it was to kill Russians
as he put it so in order to achieve that
objective meanwhile tearing Afghanistan
to shreds and leaving it in the hands of
radical Islamist fanatics who Reagan and
organized the new preceded
tear the place to shreds with such
violence that the population welcomed
the Taliban in order to just maintain
this Reagan and his administration
pretended that they didn't know that
Pakistan was developing nuclear weapons
and although it was completely obvious
and they certainly knew but they had to
pretend that they didn't know because
otherwise that would have been a barrier
to providing aid as Zeile Huck carried
out his programs which included among
other things the radical Islam ization
of Pakistan with Saudi money and us port
they developed a network of Madras as
radical schools which laid the basis for
what we're now seeing in fact
radicalization and Islamic
radicalization of substantial parts of
Pakistan so that's Pakistan India
mentioned what about Israel well Israel
of course developed its nuclear weapons
with the support and of the United
States that's not controversial but
right at the time of the passage of
resolution 1887 and the you know the
furor about whether Iran is concealing
something from the International Atomic
Energy Agency as they doubtless are
right in the middle of that furor on the
front pages every day still is the
international agency considered a
resolution calling on Israel to join the
non-proliferation treaty and to open up
its nuclear weapons nuclear facilities
including weapons facilities to
international inspection well the United
States and Europe tried to block the
resolution when they failed it was voted
anyway and it was passed but then Obama
immediately informed Israel that they
could be they were immune to it he also
informed India that they were
immune from resolution 1887 so the
resolution wasn't literally barred it
was just barred from the site of the
American population thanks to the
cooperation the media which doesn't
report things of this kind you can read
it if you read the Mexican press or AP
reports or something like that but it
didn't if you're not a disappears here
the how did the United States respond to
resolution 1887 well right at the time
that Obama received the nobel peace
prize for his inspiring contributions to
peace which maybe somebody can find if
they have a electron microscope and
their pocket but right at that time the
Pentagon announced that it is rapidly
accelerating the production of the most
lethal weapons in the u.s. arsenal short
of nuclear weapons 13-ton mom's to be
delivered by bb2 b-52 stealth bombers
which are what are called massive
penetration ordnance they're designed to
penetrate deep into the ground through
huge amounts of reinforced concrete and
destroy whatever's down there these are
huge bombs way beyond anything else the
plant everybody knows exactly what
they're for they're one of the many
threats against Iran the the program's
had actually been initiated under George
Bush but kind of languished however as
soon as Obama came into office he called
for sharp acceleration of programs and
they are now according to the Pentagon
accelerated by three years and should be
deployed within a few months that's a
part of Washington's radical violation
of the UN Charter and of course the
Security Council resolution which bans
any threat of force these are parts of
the
her threat of force and Israel's case as
well it is the US and Israel were
supposed to carry out air operations
planning clearly planning for posed as a
threat for to Iran that was kind of
undermine when turkey pulled out of it
refusing to join in the and these
violations of international law one of
the reasons why turkeys being slapped on
the wrist for its disobedience these
days but those were the reactions of the
three countries to whom against whom
resolution 1887 was directed Iran has
rotten government nobody doubts that and
certainly nobody wants Iran to develop
nuclear weapons or anyone else for that
matter but it's easy to see why the
world outside the West just doesn't take
seriously Washington's professions of
concern about these matters and the same
is true of Washington's profession the
West's professions of concern about
human rights in Iran on a terrible
repression undoubtedly but by the
standards of US allies in the region not
very bad so it's not as bad as say Saudi
Arabia or Egypt Egypt has a brutal
dictator President Mubarak and the Obama
made clear his attitude towards human
rights when he visited the Egypt for his
famous Cairo speech for which he was
magnificently praised he was asked what
he had to say about President Mubarak
and his answer was I don't like to use
labels for folks when Apollo politician
uses the word folks you kind of get
ready to shut her something Awful's
happening and he continued I don't like
to use labels for folks so I wouldn't
call him Authority
in fact he's a force for stability and
good in the region can you wonder why
the world collapses and ridicule outside
the West when they hear the United
States talking about concern for human
rights in Iran and in fact it is most of
the world outside the West we don't hear
about it because we are carefully
protected from the events of the world
by an information system designed for
that purpose media commentary and so on
so where should people know that when
you read that the that Iran is defying
the international community by enriching
uranium very few people know that the
term international community means
Washington and whoever happens to agree
with it so the majority of the countries
in the world the non-aligned countries
most of the world have repeatedly and
vigorously endorsed Iran's right to
enrich uranium within the framework of
the non-proliferation treaty of which
it's a member unlike the US allies
Israel India and Pakistan in fact very
few people know that the majority of the
American people are excluded from the
world too they also endorse that right
or they did as of a couple of years ago
when the last polls were taken it's very
likely different now because of the
dough have Xena pol because of the
massive propaganda campaign to demonize
Iran and portray it as a major threat to
world peace that's been going on for the
last few years the that's the world and
it in it's necessary to be very delicate
and reporting things so for example one
of the most maybe one of the most are
one of the most popular leaders in the
world is president Lula of Brazil and
he's also Washington's fair-haired boy
in South America he's supposed to be the
moderate as
with the bad guys who are going farther
left so it's been necessary for some
time to suppress the fact that Lula has
been quite openly and strongly
supporting Iran's right to do what it
wants within the bounds of the law
including develop developed nuclear
power enrich uranium it became if Hugo
Chavez says something like that you know
huge uproar we expect of this demon but
when Lula says the same thing even more
strongly have to suppress it if any of
your going into journalism you've got to
learn these lessons it became pretty
hard to suppress in the last few weeks
when President managed I'd visited a
Brazil so then yes you had to report it
and admonish Brazil for stepping out a
line but in fact relations between
Brazil and Iran in fact South America in
general and Iran have been improving
trade relations and others because the
world outside the West simply doesn't
follow us orders the way it's supposed
to it used to because it was terrified
to do anything else but the world is
getting more diverse and The Godfather
is losing his clout to some extent so
it's necessary to kind of suppress
what's happening though it is happening
there's a lot more like this so takes a
thee there's a lot of talking member a
couple of weeks ago Obama announced that
he was going to reconfigure the missile
defense systems in Eastern Europe which
were regarded by the Soviet Union by
Russia it's not so anymore regarded by
Russia as a threat to its security with
justice if you read us arms control
journals you'll find that US strategic
analysts like say theodore pasa postal
over at MIT recognize that these
so-called missile defense systems would
have to be construed by the Russians as
a threat to their security there's a
good reason for that a missile defense
systems are not for defense
their first strike weapons and that's
understood everywhere if they have a
work they're not going to stop a first
strike but they could conceivably stop a
retaliatory strike so they're
effectively a first strike weapon and
that's understood by strategic analysts
on all sides almost in the same words
well Obama did agree to reconfigure
these systems and move them somewhere
else and there was a big debate about
whether that was a sell out to the
Russians or whether it was as he said a
better way to defend the world against
the threat of Iranian missiles and
nuclear weapons that was the debate does
the debate make any sense I mean I
suppose Iran had missiles and nuclear
weapons could it use them I'm as much as
loaded a weapon at a country be
vaporized and the ruling clerics have
not evidenced any wish for mass suicide
and destruction of the country that they
pretty much own and in fact the US
intelligence analysts on specialize in
the Middle East consider the threat of
an Iranian attack with missiles as so
small you can't even evaluate it if
they're developing which maybe they are
it would only be as a deterrent an
effort to deter a threatened very openly
threatened us Israeli attack the US is
not quiet about this openly threatening
attack Israel even more so in fact
Israel is ascending Israel happens I
have nuclear nuclear submarines capable
of carrying nuclear tip torpedoes at
gift of Germany and it's openly sending
them through the Suez Canal with the
agreement of the force for stability and
good President Mubarak sending them
through the Suez Canal
into the Gulf as a threat to Iran saying
you know if you we don't if we want to
we can wipe you out and you won't be
able to do anything about it so yes the
threats are constant and continuous and
but those are coming from the rogue
states the only states that regularly
resort to violence and the threat of
violence who else is occupying two
countries in the region and illegally
occupying other territories who else
constantly carries out aggression in the
region and other violence I mean Iran
hasn't done it for probably two
centuries but at the United States and
Israel do it constantly so yeah there's
a good reason for the Security Council
to be concerned with preventive
diplomacy in the region and for others
concerned with preventive diplomacy to
be concerned too particularly the ones
here because we're right at the heart of
it we're at the heart of the use and
threat of the use of force and the
threat of force in the region that
nobody else begins to compare just think
it through these is kind of an
intriguing feature of our intellectual
culture that these matters cannot be
perceived I mean it's not that they're
profound or hidden I'm the right on the
surface you know completely on the
surface but they can't be perceived that
is a revealing indication of the
strength of the grip of Imperial
ideology which is comes naturally in the
West history the West for hundreds of
years sort of second nature so much so
that it literally cannot be perceived
though again there's absolutely nothing
concealed about it let's turn to the
other major trouble spot in the Middle
East Israel Palestine what's President
Obama's contribution to that Obama has
made actually one major speech about
israel-palestine it's when he introduced
George Mitchell as his negotiator now
Mitchell is a good choice for a
negotiator he was also George Bush's and
he's got a good record he was prominent
in negotiating the the peace in Northern
Ireland which is no small achievement I
happened to be in northern in Belfast
couple of weeks ago and I had been there
in 1990 3 1993 it was a war zone you
couldn't park your car you know there
were security forces all over the place
people were afraid to go from one area
to another because of the threat
literally award of this time it's
peaceful on the surface like for an
outsider like me it looks peaceful how
and of course the people all look alike
you know so you don't identify the ones
that were in conflict however as soon as
you travel around a little bit then with
the guidance of people who know Belfast
you see that while it is a vast
improvement over what it was which is a
tribute to george mitchell and bill
clinton and tony blair the division the
problems still remain not far below the
surface in fact that still is a regular
low level of terror low nothing like
what it was but the divisions remain
there's very little intermingling among
the two populations unionists and
nationalists and you see driving through
Belfast you know a wall of a building
with a big painting on it sings a
loyalist area meaning don't enter here
or enter at your risk of us you're one
of us and the visitors kind of still
there but they're not violent they're
much less violent in fact the when I
went in 1993 I was my wife and I were
taken from Dublin to belfast by a young
woman who was a Catholic
a peace activist in north in Belfast and
she is now a minister in the government
on the way she had she managed to get us
to visit with an IRA hit man who was on
the run he'd escaped from british chick
from british jail so it was kind of you
know secret place and a lot of security
and so on i spent a couple of hours
talking to him basically asking one
question what do you think you're
achieving by killing protestants his
answer basically was basically I'm not
achieving anything he killed my cousin
they killed my cousin I'm going to kill
their uncle and then they'll kill my
brother and that's the way it is well a
couple years later he was on the
negotiating team now he's in the
government okay things can change no and
change for the better and Mitchell had a
substantial role in that the real reason
it happened is because the British
finally recognized that if you want to
deal with terror and I are a terror was
not a joke you better pay some attention
to its roots the terror is it's criminal
but it's based on grievances and a lot
of those grievance is illegitimate and
they should be dealt with terror or not
and if you do pay some attention to the
grievances you'll reduce the terror and
they finally agreed the respond to
terror not buy more violence but by
paying attention to the grievances and
it worked and there's been a tremendous
improvement and that's an important
lesson of preventive diplomacy if you
like well let's go back to the Middle
East so Obama introduced Mitchell and he
made a speech and he said
the United States wants to bring about
peace through diplomacy and negotiations
and he said fortunately there's a
there's a very constructive proposal on
the table from the Arab League the
proponent he was referring to the
originally the Saudi proposal which was
adopted by the Arab League and then
adopted by the organisation of Islamic
states which includes Iran and the
proposal calls for a two-state
settlement on the international border
which has been the international
consensus for 35 years blocked only by
the United States of Israel but that's
something else were not supposed to know
the so they endorsed the international
consensus and they went beyond it in the
Arab League proposal by saying well in
the context of establishing a political
of a political settlement establishing
two states the Arab states should
proceed towards normalization of
relations with Israel okay so Obama
referred to the proposals and very
constructive at them on the head and
then urge the Arab states to live up to
it by beginning to normalize relations
with Israel he's an intelligent man he's
literate he knows that's not what the
proposal was the proposal called for
normalization of relations in the
context of a two-state settlement kind
of a corollary to it so Obama mentioned
only the corollary omitting the content
which tells everyone who has a gray cell
functioning that he intends to continue
with the US policy of extreme rejection
ISM that is blocking a political
settlement which the US has in fact been
doing ever since it clearly ever since
1976 when it vetoed a Security Council
resolution calling for a two-state
settlement on you know full guarantees
for the peace and security every state
in the region and so on put forth by the
major Arab state
time and continually on I won't run
through the record it's been a very
consistent record of leading the
rejection front of blocking diplomacy
and Obama saying okay we're going to
continue with that very clear that's his
one major speech on the least there was
also in a quite an important speech by
John Kerry our senator head of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee who's
been one of Obama's active agents and
negotiating in the region young and
Carrie had something is the Brookings
Institute a couple of couple of months
ago Carrie gave the usual picture the
standard picture virtual party line
exceptional the United States is an
honest broker but that's true by
definition limiter what's going on the
US is an honest broker trying
desperately to seek peace and human
rights and it's been sort of caught than
this is trying to get these two sides
together and Israel has been desperately
seeking a legitimate partner for peace
and it's never had one but Kerry went on
to say at last Israel may have a
legitimate partner for peace namely the
Palestinian Authority and he then gave
the reason the reason was that during
the attack on Gaza a year ago which we
call an Israeli attack but that's a
mistake it was a us-israeli attack joint
attack during the attack on Gaza which
is a violent brutal murderous attack
there were no protests in the West Bank
and the reason was that there's an army
in the west bank run by a US general
general Keith Dayton and that army was
able to suppress any protests okay so
we've got enough military control over
the population of the West Bank so they
can't even protest when the other half
of Palestine is subjected to a vicious
assault so maybe at last Israel has a
legitimate partner for peace Dayton's
army is trained with this with support
of Israel
and Jordan and it's not the most violent
army in the West Bank the most violent
but this Dayton's armies under State
Department control supervision so
there's some constraints on what it can
do kind of weak but non-existent but the
CIA is running its own military forces
there general intelligence and the
Presidential Guard and they have no
constraints look at CIA does is anything
you like reports from there are that
those are the worst state terrorist
forces so at last we have Israel has a
legitimate partner for peace and we can
proceed with our plan for peace now
right now Obama and Prime Minister
Netanyahu we're calling for negotiations
and the Palestinian Authority is
dragging its feet and so that shows
maybe it's not such a legitimate partner
negotiations are from a good thing the
better than killing each other but
negotiations presuppose something what
are the negotiations about now you can't
enter into negotiations or they're not
about anything okay so what are they
about in this case well there are two
views of that one view is that of the
entire world outside the United States
and Israel the negotiations are about a
two-state settlement on the
international border okay which the US
and Israel have been blocking for 35
years so that's one possible topic of
the other topic is the US Israeli
policies in the territories maybe
negotiate about them well what are they
well they're very clear the policies
first of all are to break Gaza from the
West Bank there's no basis for that in
law or anything else they're just the
two parts of what's left of Palestine
but they're treated quite separately now
by the United States and Israel and
that's kind of important because that
means if there ever is any kind of
Palestinian and
it won't have it'll be trapped it won't
have any access to the outside world
which it would if it were in Gaza and
Gaza was allowed to develop to be have a
seaport and airport and so on so but
it's just the West Bank it's completely
trapped in within hostile forces so
first break Gaza from the West Bank
second a turn Gaza into a prison in fact
a maximum security prison where you just
torture the population in ways which are
really sadistic like just a couple of
days ago to tighten the seeds your
seizures of course an act of war to
tighten the siege blocks anything but
just bear survival you know us Israel
don't want the population to die like
flies that would look good so keep them
alive somehow but make sure they can't
really survive so the water supplies are
destroyed sewage powers destroy the
trickle of goods get in just a couple of
days ago the Israel tightened it a
little more by closing the entry point
that follows which is the place where
cooking gas gets into Gaza so now no
cooking gas Egypt cooperated yesterday
by closing the terminal at work at the
Egypt end near Rafa preventing diesel
fuel from getting in so there's continue
to strangle the population meanwhile
drive them away from the borders so this
constant bombardment another terrorist
acts by Israel along the borders which
drive the population inland depriving
them of arable land and making the
maximum security prison even worse and
also driving away from the Seacoast so
the Israeli Navy and the last seven or
eight years has just been driving
fishing boats out of gas in territorial
waters and right up to the shore which
essentially destroys the fishing
industry because after the Israeli
destruction of the power and sewage and
other facilities the pollution on the
show
so outrageous that you can't fish there
so just drive them inland keep it to
keep the keep it tight and make the
situation worse and worse and just we'll
see what happens that's Gaza the prison
in the West Bank the policies are very
explicit there's a wall sneaking through
the West Bank it's called the separation
fence it should be called the annexation
wool it's about far higher and much
longer than the Berlin Wall and its
purpose is very explicit it's to ensure
that Israel can annex the valuable
territory in the West Bank the water
resources which happen to be behind the
annexation wool arable land and the
pleasant suburbs of Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem the place is kind of similar
to where I live say Lexington the nicer
verbs are Boston which happened to be in
the West Bank Hills so let them take
that also take the Jordan Valley which
is about a third of the territory so
that the rest is in prison and in what's
left that the u.s. Israeli settlement
programs if you look at a map a cut
through what's left with salience at one
east of Jerusalem which pretty much
bisects the West Bank and two others
farther to the north which kind of break
up what's left what's called Jerusalem
is actually a greater a great area way
beyond Jerusalem and Israeli actions
there which you read about every day in
the press you know checking out our
families building and so on those are
not only illegal but ee illegal all
settlement in the West Bank is illegal
all settlement that has been recognized
universally including by israel since
late nineteen sixty seven as Israel
began the settlement programs and after
the 67 war its highest legal authorities
highly respected international lawyer
runs its Attorney General and so on
inform the government that all of this
is in violation of international law the
defense minister Moshe Dayan who was in
charge of the occupied territories
agreed he said yes it's in violation of
international law but states violate
international law so we'll do it to
which you can do as long as the
godfather says it's fine so those are in
violation of international that's all
the settlements and Jerusalem greater
Jerusalem ee because that's also in
violation of explicit Security Council
resolutions barring any change in the
status of Jerusalem but as Diane said
yes we can violate international law
freely as long as our patron provides
military economic diplomatic and
ideological support that's us and that
will and then in the little territory
that's left hundreds of checkpoints or
put up mainly for harassment to make it
say impossible to go and an ambulance
from one place to two miles away to a
