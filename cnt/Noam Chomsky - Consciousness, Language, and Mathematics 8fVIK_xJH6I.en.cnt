renowned philosopher pioneer in
linguistics Noam Chomsky welcome thank
you very much for coming so I think
perhaps it's a very fertile area the the
convergence of linguistics in
consciousness I hope you agree what is
it that you've found coming to a
conference like this and thinking about
perhaps more about consciousness does
that inform your work on linguistics in
any way to begin with the point of
convergence that interests me
particularly is has to do with the
phenomenology of consciousness the
traditional view of consciousness was
that it regarded it as a keener directed
so the primary concern of the study of
consciousness in the 18th 17th 18th
century early days of modern science was
the inner life how to what extent are we
aware what's the nature of our awareness
of our inner life and that raises all of
the by now familiar questions about you
know what is it like to and so on what
I'd like to see this color blue what is
it like out of the fog so enjoy the same
kind questions but it's a rich area in
many respects I think a richer area to
investigate and the phenomenology of the
external consciousness in the color blue
some more complex internal system and we
can say a lot about its nature and I
think when you look into it you find
some surprising things for example in
the case of language which is kind of
the core of our mental life what
basically differentiates us from other
animals I think you find that the
internal system of language is basically
a system for generating thoughts and
that system
is disconnected from books consciousness
and the externalization of it to the
outer world so there's things going on
in our mind then you can sometimes
externalize them and one or another
sensory modality we usually use speech
but sign is about the same it's even
possible to use touch like Helen Keller
for example but the the internal
workings of the mind are inaccessible to
consciousness and even when we produce
what's called inner speech when you
construct the thought in your mind
talking to yourself something you do
obey constantly even all night that's
the external system it's not getting to
what's going on internally it's taking a
long time to get to realize this the
study of language for the last 2,500
years and the philosophy of language in
Sedona concentrate on what's produced
but what's produced is not really
language it's an interaction of the
internal system with the sensory motor
system now that's the interaction two
entirely different systems so it's
complex of course and in fact as we're
now learning I think the apparent
variety of languages and the what looks
like the complexity of language and the
easy mutability of language changes from
generation to generation is actually the
externalization doesn't seem to affect
the internal system in fact it's even
possible you can now produce a credible
thesis not established credible that the
internal system of constructing thoughts
could be universal that may not change
the role among humans it's just part of
in human
and then there are various ways of
mapping it to the outside which look
complicated and there's the external
life there's the external system but
they're not they're a mixture of
language with another system and even
what we find when we investigate them if
you think just construct the fault in
your mind it's not the internal system
you can trigger that it's the external
system so what's going on internally it
doesn't is so deep inside that even when
we introspect and construct thoughts in
our mind we're not getting to it
but it's pretty strong evidence is there
and it's determining the fragments that
reach awareness and it's interspersed
with them it's inextricable amalgam so
if you want say the phenomenology of
consciousness it's necessary the
crucially to bring in the internal
computations about which we learn in an
indirect way I'm wondering to what
degree some of this could be at least
shall we say some correlation between
bohmian theory of fear familiar David
Bohm and his and his idea of the
implicit and explicit and the implicit
seems to be this field of potential that
gives rise to what we experience and
suppose Plato had some prior version of
that and along with this field of
potential comes into being such things
as mathematics which once upon a time
didn't really exist and now does and
mathematics of course is a language as
well mathematics raises interesting
questions remembering there are two
separate questions
there's arithmetic and everything else
under very different arithmetic conflict
the knowledge of arithmetic seems to be
kind of like language exchange Lia
common in possession even there plenty
of languages that don't have words for
numbers beyond maybe one two three but
it appears that the people have the
whole numbers isn't it there's been
interesting study about that they just
don't have any other ways of expressing
it like five Kahneman they enter into a
commercial economy to deal with things
pretty quickly notes as part of our
nature a lot of the great results in
mathematics which has done pretty much
by intuition and I think which the way
mathematics developed by now mathematics
is no it's a an idealized formula could
be formalized Enterprise with the
formalized proofs of joke you know still
to this day mathematical procedure done
largely by intuition you assume that
it'd be four months but so that this
attention that's some cognitive capacity
that we have the earth medical capacity
to capacity create mathematics but for
that matter the capacity great science
and why should we have that capacity and
it's a very interesting one so if you go
back to the origins of modern science
the Galilean period it was a real wrench
psychological wrench to try to
comprehend and to be practical to
convince the aristocrats of hunger
because convinced them where you can't
go on to comprehend that it makes sense
to study things that don't exist like a
ball rolling down a frictionless plane
and why should you study a ball rolling
down
play the why not study leads blowing in
the wind with any natural phenomenons
much more interesting and exciting why
these idealized structures you're
constructing some which are even
impossible now it's taken for granted
that science studies highly abstracted
idealized systems with not the data of
the world
you don't take videotapes in the world
if you want to learn the laws of motion
and say the fact that to make that to
overcome that psychological barrier was
by no means easy Galileo and others had
to release probably and in fact a
conception that they came up with almost
immediately
was it the world must be a complicated
machine in that period in Europe skilled
artisans were making extremely complex
automata you know which were acting out
that have seen from the Bible
doing all sorts of complicated things
the physical world they were peopled
with a machine which was a world of
complex automata and the idea that the
world itself is just a bigger and more
complex of dominant constructed by super
skilled craftsmen was very intuitive in
fact I think it's probably I our
intuition cool about what the world is
that's why I was such a shock when
Newton demonstrated that the world is
not a machine that there are no machines
that nothing works by mechanical
principle there's interaction without
contact and it meant self-regard beds of
total absurdities
nobody with any scientific sensibility
could pay any attention to this but it
just seems to be true which was which is
why he presumably like all his great
work the mathematical principles not
physical science it wasn't physical
science and she's mathematical
principles seem to work and again it
took a quite long time before it became
common sense science to disregard
intelligibility to disregard
conceivability and its evently in the
study of consciousness that leap hasn't
been made so it's very common to hear
that you know consciousness could not be
reduced to physical things because it's
inconceivable that conceivability was
found out after they in the hard
sciences that's just non-marking we
don't try to get a conceivable
intelligible picture of the world and we
try to science just reduced its goals
from conceivability of what the world is
or intelligibility of the world to
intelligibility of theories so the
scientists of Newton's time didn't
himself alive notes lichens others they
could understand that mysterious
loudness of series that wasn't the
problem it's just what they the world
that they described was unintelligible
but that concern has disappeared from
the natural sciences though it still
shows up in the emerging Sciences so you
read that we can't conceive of how
neurons could have the feel of seeing
blue and say no can't conceive
they're just not an issue in the
sciences question is too true you know
and others leaps are not easy to make
and they come right through the history
sciences up till today
