would be more effective than the
demonstration because demonstration is
just one inch and letters you just get
maybe four or five inches of full
explanation of what you're doing in
Illinois during the Vietnam War we are
much more effective in electoral
politics is McCarthy and George McGovern
in fact Democratic Congress caucus in
the House voted against funding for the
war despite the fact that McGovern lost
that McGovern had just demonstrated
enough strength in election districts
across the country at the grassroots
level 50 congressmen knew that next time
up they would see challenges to
congressional seats in the congressional
districts with McGovern successfully
elected delegates they saw the
handwriting of the war they voted to cut
off the funds of the Democratic caucus
in the house and the day after that
Nixon signed the peace treaty and ended
the war so that was the effective way
electoral politics but here people Ike
went with Chicago teaching for peace and
justice yes essentially and then
chortling over 10,000 people blocking
one street in Chicago and the using has
a big victory but government can easily
use an alternative street run tanks down
the street to mow people down that's
totally a symbolic victory these
demonstrations don't accomplish anything
in in Illinois if here I'm going to let
you go thanks - you made your point
well I your one part of what you say I
completely agree with just
demonstrations not connected with day to
day ongoing educational and organizing
activities are pointless but take the
case of the Vietnam War which was
dragged out in that case I think there
the evidence is pretty strong that the
demonstrations were very effective they
were they were part of on exactly what
you're suggesting should be done they
were part of every day-to-day organizing
educational activities and the
demonstrations grew out of them
stimulated other people to join made
other people understand what was
happening contributed to the activism
which ultimately after many years many
years led to the appearance of political
figures who were willing to
become you know the leaders of the
official leaders of a what was by then a
mass popular movement and that was after
years and years of very hard work
including demonstrations and I think
there's very strong evidence that they
were successful if you want to have some
direct evidence for it in 1968 after the
Tet Offensive in January 1968 the
business world turned strongly against
the war because it was becoming very
costly to the United States it was
becoming costly because Lyndon Johnson
was never able to call a national
mobilization of the kind that was called
during the Second World War which led to
a very efficient economy he wasn't able
to do that because there was too much
discontent they had to fight what they
call the guns and butter war which led
to stagflation and economic problems the
discontent was the result of activism
including demonstrations Johnson was
essentially there's a real power play
from the business world he was
essentially told to call off the war
after the Tet Offensive which indicated
was going to go on for a long time he
wanted to send 200,000 more troops to
South Vietnam the Joint Chiefs of Staff
were opposed the reason they said was
because they thought they would need the
troops for civil disorder control in the
United States where large segments of
the population we're just getting out of
hand now they mentioned women youth
minorities others this is in the last
part of the Pentagon Papers worth taking
a look at the disorder and the
discontent revealed themselves in many
ways demonstrations being a very visible
part but much more than that and the
appearance of politicians Eugene
McCarthy's a good case was much later
and only when there was a mass base for
it then the politicians appeared not or
before there were a few the grinning and
Morse were too but very few until there
popular movement it developed and I
don't really agree with you about the
diamonds it can be if it's not done
properly yes it can be destructive but
you can say that about anything the
demonstrations on February 15th around
the world were so and they're the
biggest mass demonstrations in history I
suppose they were so significant that
actually the New York Times a little
unhappily in its comment on them said a
day after that there are now two
superpowers and on the planet one is the
United States meaning the US government
the other is world public opinion well
you know world public opinion was
visible on February 15th and that led to
the recognition that there's a powerful
force there that has to be dealt with it
didn't stop this war but you know the
there's never been protests like this
against the war at that stage you're
quite correct in your account of how
long it took to build up protest to the
Vietnam War which actually started in
1962 this protest was before the war had
actually started that indicates a major
change in consciousness and
understanding in the country and it's
the basis I think for developing
significant popular movements which will
impede and help reverse the use of
violence in world domination and control
but it doesn't happen in a day and your
point about day to day explanation work
leafleting and so on is absolutely
correct unless that's a central part of
the activity demonstrations don't mean
anything
Jerusalem Rhode Island good afternoon I
anti-terrorism Bill's were rushed
through Congress in the days after the
Oklahoma City bombing and have been
extended since September 11th the
problem is that clearly some of those
bills had been written and printed
before the bomb
already the FBI Joint Terrorism Task
Force has issued Flyers urging the
public to call for information about
possible terrorists defenders of the US
Constitution and and those people who
would make numerous references to the
Constitution or attempt to police the
police and loan individuals I believe
this is an undermining of basic
democracy and and I believe that the FCC
rule change that is proposed for On June
2nd that would allow the media companies
such as Clear Channel Communications to
be able to purchase newspapers will
limit the Free Press as a novelist I
believe that you probably also support
not allowing these large media companies
like Clear Channel to be able to
purchase newspapers on top of on top of
radio stations since two out of every
three households are reached by six
major media companies as a novelist do
you do you support the Free Press or do
you support this media rule change that
um mr. Powell Michael Powell who was the
son of the Secretary of Defense : Powell
for some unusual reason but it has been
eluded through Alice in Wonderland and
the World Trade Center disaster written
by David Icke what that relationship
between mr. Powell and Michael Powell
and and the government's hidden agenda
to eliminate basic civil liberties are
do you support this media rule change by
the FCC any scholar yeah well on the
specific question of the you brought up
many interesting point on the specific
question of the FCC ruling I'm on your
side I don't think that I think that the
planned ruling will increase monopoly
the tendency towards centralization and
monopolization of media which is a very
bad thing
it's been going on for years quite apart
from this the major monitor of the study
which they regularly published study
which deals with this is
been back Dickens book the media
monopoly
I think the first edition of it must
have been about 20 years ago and he then
identified if I remember correctly about
50 major concentrations of media in the
country the last edition which was a
year or two ago I think it was down to
under 10 and the FCC ruling will reduce
it even further and not in the print
media but in including the print media
in fact I think it's a very bad thing we
want to diverse as a diverse oppressors
we can get I don't think that's the only
problem with the press at all but it's a
problem on the other issue that you
raised about anti-terrorism legislation
and civil liberties here I think we have
to be we have to have a certain caution
terrorism is a serious issue I mean
personally I don't object when I pass
through security at the airport I think
that's you know you could argue about
the details but that something should be
checked make sense on the other hand the
Justice Department the Bush Justice
Department has claimed rights which are
incredible the if they are implemented
is a major attack on civil liberties and
to an extent they have been in to an
extent they've even been upheld by the
court I mean they've claimed the that
the executive has the right to imprison
people including citizens of the United
States to hold them without trial
without charge without access to family
and lawyers and to do so indefinitely
until the president declares that the
war on terror is over which means
indefinitely there's a new act under
discussion Patriot 2 it's sometimes
called which includes provisions that
would grant the Attorney General the
right to actually withdraw citizenship
rescind citizenship on what's called
inference the Attorney General's
inference from some pattern of the hey
sure that the person supports terrorists
and this Saturday outlandish no free and
democratic society should tolerate
anything remotely like this
there are what's happening on Guantanamo
is absolutely shocking and has been
condemned by every human rights and
civil rights organization throughout the
world and may be getting worse I don't
know can't authenticate it but there are
now reports in the British press and
Australian press that there are plans
for and it's Bennett the British Foreign
Office has a agree that it's correct
that there are plans to have execution
chambers in Guantanamo where people can
be executed without anything remotely
resembling a fair trial on charges that
and without proper legal representation
or anything like that these these moves
are act really shocking and we should be
you're right that we should be deeply
concerned about them
I might quote remember the wording a
comment by Winston Churchill about this
Churchill's bust is on George Bush's -
desk II looked at it every day
Churchill described he said that
something like this - took place a man
in prison without charge and without the
judgment of his peers in a fair trial is
in the highest degree
odious and the foundation of all
totalitarian governments whether Nazi or
communist Churchill said that in 1943
when he was opposing efforts to
institute preventive detention for
alleged intelligence purposes and in
1943 Britain was in pretty dire straits
it was under attack by the most vicious
and murderous military machine in
history and its survival was not obvious
nevertheless he took that position which
is correct and he's right what's now
being proposed is and in part
implemented is in the highest degree
odious
and the foundation of all totalitarian
societies whether or not to your
communist and we should be deeply
concerned about that here's some of the
ninety-eight books that Noam Chomsky has
published over the last just what we're
talking about almost 50 years American
power and the new mandarins a new
foreword by Howard Zinn this is 2002
when it came back out this one called
World Order's old and new by Noam
Chomsky remember the year this was out
first published in 1994 and there's an
expanded edition in 1996 and here's
another one deterring democracy was the
national bestseller can you still buy
this one in the stores who's a national
bestseller I doubt that's what it says
at the top you should know never to
believe anything that's put by a
publisher on it covered that was 91
extended and I need to most of these
still in print yeah Carlsbad California
go ahead please thank you yes sir I'm a
military officer with 25 years of
experience who's read Mark Twain's more
prayer and I got a couple of quick
questions for you and I'd like to know
whether or not you think it's perfectly
natural for a country to protect its
borders and guidance net interests
whether they be protecting a population
against terrorism or securing economic
interests and in the case of radical
Islamic terrorism that we might have had
the burst the terrorist bubble in a
failure in the wake of a failure of
diplomacy and that wasn't necessarily
our failure looking at their motive
intents and consequences and that that's
the first part if I could come back
well should a country have a right to
defend its population and its economy
certainly I don't think that's a
question I didn't exactly understand
what you meant about the Islamic
terrorism well given the war in Iraq
that we were over there perhaps in the
in the face of radical Islamic terrorism
no there's no look that was a
fabrication there is no evidence
whatsoever
I mean Iraq was our Saddam Hussein's a
horrible monster just as he was when he
was supported by the United States the
people now in office in the 1980s he was
a hideous monster Osama bin Laden is
another
is monster but there are different
monsters and they hate each other
and there's no evidence whatsoever for
of any meaningful evidence of a
connection between saddam hussein's
horrifying regime and the networks like
al-qaeda they despise each other and
have had no known connections the only
effect of the war on in Iraq on terror
is that it has as predicted increased
recruitment for al-qaeda so it's
increased the threat of terror exactly
it was predicted by intelligence
agencies in the United States and
throughout the world and other
specialists but the idea that attacking
Iraq had something through the war on
terror is is just mendacity quick
follow-up Carlsbad yes sir thank you
with respect to foreign policy and the
pieces potential for peace in the Middle
East do you think that first world
countries which have a tremendous
ability to provide resources and and aid
to developing countries can promote
peace in the face of Arab humiliation
and overcome Israeli defensive mos
well we have to ask that there's a REIT
here I think we might listen to the
leading specialists on the topic namely
from Israeli intelligence so the they
the chief of the former chief of Israeli
military intelligence just pointed out
in a book in Hebrew that until Arabs
until Israel is willing to treat Arabs
with respect as decent as human beings
with right there will never be an end to
terror twenty years earlier a former
head of Israeli military intelligence yo
show that harcavy said essentially the
same thing he said until we deal with
the legitimate grievances and demands of
the Palestinian people under military
occupation there will always be the
threat of terror he was writing at a
time when Israel was virtually immune
from terror from within the territories
just in the year 2000 the
the head of the Israeli Secret falesha
buck the general security services which
control the occupied territories
essentially said the same thing they
said until we deal with the legitimate
grievances and demands of the
Palestinian population under occupation
we will never put an end to terror that
the the so the humiliation is there and
the degradation is there and the
repression is there and yes it does lead
to sometimes the terror certainly
opposition and incidentally if we want
to look ourselves in the mirror as we
should this goes way back George Bush is
not the first president to ask why do
they hate us almost 50 years ago
President Eisenhower in internal
discussions with his staff which have
since been Declassified discussed what
he called the campaign of hatred against
us in the Arab world not by governments
which are on our side but by the people
and his National Security Council gave
an explanation for it they said that
there is a perception in the Arab world
that the United States supports corrupt
and oppressive regimes which blocked
democracy and development and that we do
it because of our interest in
controlling the oil reserves of the
region and furthermore they said that
the perception is correct so it's very
difficult to counter and they said yes
we have to continue doing it you hear
the same feelings expressed today even
by wealthy Muslim managers of
multinational corporations they perceive
the United States correctly as
supporting brutal corrupt repressive
regimes that are blocking democracy and
development and yes that leads to
antagonism and often hatred it's not the
source of some event Laden but it is the
reservoir of background that the heads
of Israeli military intelligence and the
secret police we're talking about we
have to be serious about that if you
want to stop terrorism
I'm the same straw elsewhere takes a
Northern Ireland as long as the British
responded to IRA terror with just
escalation of violence it increase the
terror when they came to the point of
beginning to deal with the legitimate
grievances it did improve the situation
enormous Lee it's not a utopia but it's
much better than it was ten years ago
Stamford Connecticut for our noam
chomsky hello yes mr. Chomsky I share
your views and revulsion at much of u.s.
foreign policy and I think you're right
once you understand it it's irrefutable
accrual evil and self ruthlessly
self-interested in many many many
instances and I find you to be an
invaluable voice of criticism and
dissent yet your views are almost never
appear in the mainstream media do you
feel you're centered at some level by
the mainstream organs in this country
well I wouldn't call it censorship
you're right that I don't appear in the
mainstream media and not just me but the
same is true of other critical voices
the media do in fact reflect a pretty
rigid and I think narrow spectrum of
opinion and if you don't belong to it
you know if you're there it's it's not
censorship it's their choice and
decision Sharon Pennsylvania you're all
with Noam Chomsky some disagreement but
most agreement with you and one of the
it's it's in the point that I feel you
don't go far enough for instance just on
the last point for instance NPR read
that even when you're speaking to a
smaller audience at American University
from which NPR broadcasters Diane Rehm
show your you've been barred from that
program even when you're very
conveniently to be interviewed and I
think it has a lot to do with the fact
that the chairman of NPR is the former
head of all CIA propaganda foreign
broadcast and the head for instance of
PBS is the former head of voice of
America now when you've got that on the
suppose an alternative to the corporate
media that the big business media which
is interlocked and owned by
military industrial weapons
manufacturers and colludes with the CIA
I think there is quite a bit of
censorship and another I do read your
stuff on z mag dot org like a previous
caller and that's very useful i think
but it doesn't go far enough in many
cases richness your your you claim that
somehow it's not plausible that the
administration or a faction within an
intelligence supporting the
administration had prior knowledge and
saw that the only one that would benefit
from this attack in 9/11 would be the
war mongers within the Bush
administration and the police state
factions within the Ashcroft justic
Justice Department I think is belied by
the fact and this gets to the media that
James Bamford the top NSA expert who
wrote the book body of evidence points
out from Declassified State Department
and pentagon documents that in the early
60s the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
Undersecretary of Defense had plans to
terror bomb American cities murder
American citizens even bomb an American
ship in Guantanamo Harbor to frame up
Cuba to blame Cuba for these US
government planned bombings and then use
it as a pretext to invade now there is a
real precedent there it was only called
off by the Kennedy administration
because apparently they figured that you
know they Mike it might go awry but it
shows that there are these uh clones of
this very fanatical ultra-right faction
almost duplicate at that time within the
high levels of government that
correspond to this Bush administration
with this plans for world domination
thanks caller mr. Johnson well what
you're referring to is operation
Northwood you can its Declassified you
can read it if you like it was a
contingency plan called at the request
to the Department of Defense and it did
have roughly the character you describe
but if you look at contingency plans
they are all over the map they've got
plans for everything and it was not
implemented and it wasn't the only one
there were other plans that came from
the more liberal sectors of the Kennedy
administration for example plans to
stage
a what look would look like a Cuban
invasion of Haiti which could then be
used as a basis for invading Cuba
actually that one came from Arthur
Schlesinger away over at the liberal end
but you know from looking at contingency
plans by governments I don't think you
couldn't conclude very much on the 9/11
event you have to make a distinction
crucial distinction between two things
the earlier question at least as I
understood it was whether the Bush
administration was involved in planning
it for that I think it's outlandish the
question you're asking is whether there
could have been foreknowledge of it well
that's conceivable but then we have to
be a little cautious because remember
that in 1993 almost 10 years earlier
there was an attempt to blow up the
World Trade Center which came very close
to succeeding and if it had succeeded
would have caused tens of thousands of
death deaths since that time there was
no doubt in the intelligence community
that operations of this kind were
possible and might take place whether
there was any foreknowledge of this one
I haven't seen any convincing evidence
of that but it's conceivable in a moment
gonna take a break in our guest Noam
Chomsky is a graduate of the University
of Pennsylvania with a BA and MA and a
PhD got out of there in 1955 has been at
MIT since 1968 9550 actually 55 and has
published a total of 98 books over these
years you have three children
Diane avi and Harry that's right where
are each of them today were they doing
Ivy's the older oldest is teaching at
Salem State College near Boston Latin
American specialists in Latin American
history teaches history Diane our second
daughter is happens to be in Mexico at
the moment but is primarily living in
Nicaragua where she's been about 15
years and that's her family there our
son Harry the third child is living in
the Bay Area works in software
engineering the Trinity we have about an
hour and 45 minutes to go and we'll be
back with Noam Chomsky and more and your
calls in just a moment
about ten years ago the United States
had the highest wages in the world which
is what you'd expect this is the richest
country in the world by far and it has
absolutely unparalleled advantages real
wages have in fact stagnated or even
declined for the majority the population
since their peak around 25 years ago but
in the mid-80s the effects of the
double-edged so-called conservatism of
the Reaganites namely markets for the
poor and state protection for the rich
that hadn't yet had its full impact by
1993 the impact was quite obvious the
Wall Street Journal was able to exalt
over what it called a welcome
development of transcendent importance
namely US labor costs had fallen below
all other leading industrial powers
apart from England we actually did fall
below England for a while but then
Margaret Thatcher succeeded in driving
the working people and the poor down
even more efficiently than us meanwhile
profits were rising to new heights
earlier this year every year Fortune
magazine has a new big business magazine
has a review of the fortune 500 you know
the 500 top guys and this year earlier
this year they reported dazzling profits
that's their word for the 500 top
corporations even though sales were
stagnating so wages are going down sales
are stagnating and profits are zooming
to dazzling Heights sometimes called a
paradox in fact if you look at social
policy is not terribly paradoxical
watching professor Chomsky there from
1994 and he's here in our studios for
the next 1 hour and 45 minutes and we've
got calls waiting to talk to him this
one from Omaha Nebraska
you're on the air Omaha please go ahead
yes I appreciate the opportunity to ask
a question I think it's in line what was
what was just shown you know a little
talk you're doing about economics and
stuff I've been pretty deeply interested
in socialism over the past 12 years
and you know I keep hearing that you
know socialism is on the rise again in
the u.s. at least within the
universities and stuff they say always
say now all the faculties you know I
would east and west are more and more
socialistic and I guess I see is kind of
rude of all the evil all this you know
imperialism and capitalism economics
creating all these you know Wars and
terrorism blah blah blah I just I'd like
to hear more of your commentary on you
know the potential or what's going on
you know realistically now in the US and
the world in terms of a true socialistic
movement you know in terms of like the
working class really taking charge of
economics potentially rather than all
this to me is what screwed up versions
of what is called socialism you know
through tax cuts and blah blah blah blah
blah you know that they're going to read
this true you know that's what you get
to the mainstream media that they're
going to create tax cuts and
redistribute it that Matt so that's what
they call socialism thanks a lot
well the tax cuts are a curious kind of
socialism I mean the tax cuts are
intended to and having the effect of
redistributing income even more toward
the rich than is currently the case in
fact the tax cuts are pretty clearly
part of a an effort to destroy the
progressive legislation of the past
century including social spending in
general Social Security
medicare/medicaid the progressive taxes
and so on
that's virtually conceded I don't know
how closely we've been following the
business pages in the last couple of
days but it's been revealed that the
former secretary of the Treasury before
it was fired commissioned a study by the
top government economists Treasury
Department Bureau of the budget and so
on to estimate the likely effects of the
Bush administration economic programs
that includes a vast increase in federal
spending primarily for the military
which means high tech industry in
general and tax cuts directed target
directed primarily towards the most
wealthy sectors enormous tax cuts they
estimated deficits on the order of a
forty four trillion dollars trillion
dollars that's a lot of money that was
supposed to be put into the February
budget proposals but didn't appear there
there's a debate about whether that was
purposeful or not anyway it's now
revealed and conceded the White House
spokesperson Ari Fleischer was asked
about it in a press conference a couple
days ago and he said yes the figures are
correct and then paraphrasing him he
said something like this he said this
means that Congress will have to be
responsible in reforming Social Security
Medicare and Medicaid now the kind of
reform he's talking about is not funding
it through reinstituting progressive tax
measures but basically killing it they
know that they cannot approach the
population in an election on a platform
saying we're gonna eliminate social
spending and transfer wealth even more
to the wealth even it is today but they
can and I think are intending to drive
the country into what a number of
economists have called a fiscal train
wreck which will then have the effect of
eliminating social spending so this is
about as remote from any verb
this is you it's it's government
intervention on the benefit for the
benefit of the wealthy now as far as
socialism is concerned that term has
been so evacuated of content over the
last century that it's hard even to use
I mean the Soviet Union for example was
called a socialist society and it was
called that by the two major propaganda
operations in the world the u.s. the
Western one and the Soviet one they both
called it socialism for opposite reasons
the West call that socialism in order to
defame socialism by associating it with
this miserable tyranny the Soviet Union
called it socialism in order to gain
whatever to benefit from the moral
appeal that true socialism had among
large parts of the general world
population but this was about as a
remote from socialism as he can imagine
I'm the core notion of at least
traditional socialism is that what you
mentioned that working people have to be
in control of production and communities
have to be in control of their own lives
and so on it's and you know this is this
because the Soviet years the exact
opposite of that working people had no
control over anything
they were virtual slaves and the
collapse of the Soviet Union is in fact
small victory for socialism in my
opinion eliminated one of the major
barriers to it and should have been
recognized as such but the term has been
as I said so become so meaningless that
it's hard even to use if we use it in
the traditional sense which you brought
up that goes that you know that's goes
straight back in American history you
read the working-class press in the mid
19th century you know press published by
artisans and what we're called factory
girls young women from the farms working
in the textile mills and
eastern Massachusetts which was Center
of beginning of the Industrial
Revolution their press was calling for
they said their theme was that those who
those who work in the mills ought to own
them wage labor which was called wage
slavery was regarded by most Americans
as not very different from slavery even
the Republican Party regarded wage labor
as just a pro at best a preliminary to
free labor but intolerable because it's
kind of servitude
large part of the northern population
fighting civil war was fighting under
that banner this goes straight through
the 20th century the idea that people
should be in control of their own
destinies and lives including the
institutions in which they work the
communities in which they live and so on
call it what name you want but that's
traditional socialism and there are
there are today attempts to describe a
kind of a detailed vision of the future
based on these notions the most
extensive and detailed one I know is by
Michael Albert at Zenith which you
mentioned the participatory economics
and there are other such proposals but I
think this is deeply in a deeply
ingrained and people's understanding and
consciousness and barely below the
surface in fact it's a call for
essentially extension of democracy to
the industrial sphere and to the
communities as well we should also bear
in mind that the deleting American
social philosopher John Dewey I was as
mainstream as apple pie he his main work
was concentrated on democracy he pointed
out over and over again that as long as
we have what we call he called
Industrial feudalism that is a
tyrannical control private power
controlling production commerce
democracy will be very
that has to we have to move to what he
called industrial democracy if we hope
to have significant democracy as for
politics his position was that until
that happens politics will be the shadow
cast over society by big business
whatever then and I think most of the
population recognizes that and accept it
New York City good afternoon good
afternoon yes hello dr. Chomsky I heard
you refer to your early experiences with
Zionism I imagined a more Universal and
idealistic Zionism from that period and
I was wondering if you could speak on
the evolution of your relationship with
designers and the State of Israel and
also perhaps if you could speak on what
your vision might be for an Israel maybe
drawing on that more optimistic early
Zionism and how the process of getting
to that vision differs from Oslo Clinton
and Barack in 2000 and now the roadmap
well this laughs be brief but in this
book that was mentioned before Middle
East allusions there's a lot of
discussion of that some of the essays
there go back to over 35 years up to the
present but to try to put it briefly at
the time when I was a I was a Zionist
youth leader an activist back in you
know in the 1940s but for me
Zionism meant opposition to a Jewish
state and that was a recognized accepted
part of the Zionist movement my no means
a majority but it was a position within
what was called the Zionist movement
opposition to a Jewish state and I think
the reasons for that we're good the same
reasons why I'd be opposed to a
Christian state or a white state or an
Islamic Republic same reasons a state
should be a state of its citizens and
not of some privileged category of its
citizens and the State of Israel
incidentally by
High Court ruling is the state of the
Jewish people in Israel and in the
Diaspora but not of its citizens and I'm
opposed to that I've always been opposed
to it so on that respect my views
haven't changed the if this was merely a
matter of symbolism it wouldn't matter
much so the fact that the United States
has a day off on Sunday okay doesn't
make it a Christian state in any sense
that matters but if there were special
privileges for Christians or White's or
others it would be a different matter
then I think we should be opposed to it
and that's true in Israel after the
establishment of the state in 1948 which
the issue of the existence of Israel was
essentially over as far as I'm concerned
it should have the rights of any state
in the international system
I don't think states have many
legitimate rights but that's another
story but whatever rights you Accord to
any state in the international system
okay Israel should have those rights it
should be democratic internally meaning
the state of its own citizens not of a
of the majority of them and other Jews
elsewhere after 1967 the situation
changed radically in 1967 Israel
conquered the West Bank Sinai Gaza and
the Golan Heights and since that time
it's now the 36th year of a quite harsh
and brutal occupation in which time

does is by u.s. authorization and with
US diplomatic military and economic
support they can't go much beyond what
the US authorizes and what they have
done is move to integrate the West Bank
particularly into Israel to the extent
that they want it
so there are settlement massive
settlement programs which have broken
the West Bank into
Canton's effectively and the to get
quickly to the Clinton Barack program
programs at Camp David they were
approached at the map of what was
proposed
it's rather striking that the while
there was much talk about the how
