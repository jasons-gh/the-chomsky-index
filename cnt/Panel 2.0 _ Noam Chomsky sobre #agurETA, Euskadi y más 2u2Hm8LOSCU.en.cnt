so we would like to ask you for your
thoughts of the announcement of the
Spanish terrorist group etta stop
violence a few days ago beyond political
or strategic implications in specific
Spanish or even European scenario our
question is focused on your opinion
about society and citizenship how do you
think we will resolve this conflict will
Spanish people be able to rise to the
circumstances to make things progress
will they forgive in order to achieve
the future in peace the band victims
with those family members are asking
these days please not forget they demand
for the weapons delivered to the
authorities as IRA kid in Ireland and
the terrorist group together with their
supporters apologize in public for the
crimes committed on 43 years well I mean
I wouldn't want us I don't think it
makes much sense right speculate what is
going to happen what matters is
affecting what's going to happen we
speculate about human affairs that much
variation too much depends on will
choice individual commit that also
explains the predictions about human
affairs are pretty unsuccessful my lord
the as far as policies go right there do
all around this attack came out of
repression and persecution not out of
nothing
that's why it happened in the vast
country and not somewhere else and it
did things that yes they should have
done to apologize for but the repressive
system out of which they grew and
developed also as things to apologize
for I think that's what happened in
Northern Ireland the what happened in
northern island is rather instructive
IRA terror was pretty serious came close
to destroying the killing all the
British Cabinet when it was very serious
terror and written responded to it for a
long time by just more repression and
that escalated the cycle of violence I
already then turned to more violence
actually I was in Ireland northern
child in 1993 with the human rights
activists traveling around them I
actually met an underground IRA member I
are a hit man who had escaped from jail
and he was underground we met in some
kind of safe house and I spent a couple
hours just asking him basically you know
what do you try to achieve and he said
nothing I mean they killed my cousin i'm
going to kill their uncle and they'll
kill my grandfather i'll go on and
that's what we're going to do a couple
years later this guy was on the
negotiating team I think he's known the
government finally what what happened
finally is that it was for him very were
bitter I mean when Belfast it was like a
war zone you could park a car without
having to open the you know the trunks
they could expect people were afraid to
go from east to west Belfast sure was
there again just last year and it's like
any city there are tensions you know
some neighborhoods where you can see
other people aren't wanted there's the
kind of ethnic tensions others religious
that you get in cities general but it
was said it wasn't different from other
cities written it well what happened is
that written finally instead of
responding to terror with mortar or
pressure maybe had to ask themselves
what's it coming from what are the
grievances and there were legitimate
grievances with substantial repression
of the Catholic population when they
began to attend to the grievances the
terror reduced you began to get
interactions negotiations like what I
just described that is transferred and
not many years I learned from the war
zone to a place with conflict but not
violent ones so could we credit that
thief to face I sense the moment safe to
say you say you get government to Ira
well you know every situation is
different but I think the general model
is correct the same with us so cold war
on terror I mean if you respond to
terror by more violence that's just gift
to the vanguard of the terrorist groups
that's what they want it helps mobilize
people to their cause if you ask
yourself what are the causes of the what
lies behind it it's not coming it's
always never coming from nowhere it's
usually coming from reasons often
serious grievances grievances are often
legitimate as they were in the case of
the vast country and if you start
dealing sympathetically and
constructively the grievances the
support for a violent action erodes and
didn't you get settlements actually as
far as I understand that's pretty much
what happened in the best country it's
and as for looking back at apologies
plenty of room on all sides but there
should be moved towards reconciliation
integration developing satisfactory
relationships I can spain is a
complicated place there's a lot of a lot
of local the regions are different one
another different languages different
customs and I think that's very healthy
if you go down to I was in Barcelona
couple acres I was in Barcelona right
after the fall of Franco and you near
word of cattle and wanting to run the
streets and it was Franco was born but
the repressive apparatus is there and
that just a fear the mood of being
repressed I was there and ten years
later everything's Catalan I happen to
be in a hotel near the downtown square
and on Sunday morning people were
straining toward the square musicians on
the cathedral steps of doing folk dances
lively exciting environment it's
reviving was always there but it's
openly reviving traditional cultures
languages and it Justin riches the whole
society if it leads to tensions and
problems you know like maybe smash
workers aren't
some claim but there can be problems but
life human life is as a very complex
nature and that's probably part of its
liveliness and excitement is if everyone
was the same that we want to commit
suicide
