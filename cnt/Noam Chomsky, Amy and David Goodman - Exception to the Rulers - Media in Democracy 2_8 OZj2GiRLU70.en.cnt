this is and I quote going where the
silence is giving a voice to those who
have been forgotten Forsaken and beaten
down by the powerful she suggests that
the media today have largely ignored
this responsibility Amy Goodman has not
her determination to give people a voice
has taken her to some of the globe's
most dangerous places reporting on the
us-backed Indonesian occupation of East
Timor she and a colleague witnessed a
massacre of civilians by Indonesian
troops and we're themselves brutally
beaten but they filled the silence their
documentary massacre the story of East
Timor won numerous prizes including the
robert f kennedy prize for international
reporting and the alfred i dupont
colombia silver baton in 1998 she
reported from nigeria and the
exploitation of its people by chevron
oil in the country's dictatorship her
work culminated in the award-winning
radio documentary drilling and killing
Chevron and Nigeria's oil dictatorship
The Washington Post calls Goodman and i
quote a reporter who sinks her teeth in
and never lets go
her fierce and always independent voice
can be heard regularly on Democracy Now
the pacifica radio shows she hosts and
helped launch nearly a decade ago on New
York's WBAI welcome to the Cambridge
forum Amy Goodman
okay well it's a great honor to be here
and to be here with my brother and
co-author David Goodman to be here with
noam to be here with my family my mom
dari Goodman my brother Dan Goodman my
sister and lawsuit mentor and so many of
you who like so many people around the
country are deeply concerned about
what's taking place today I come from
pacifica radio which was founded 55
years ago this past week founded by a
man named Lou Hill who is a world war
two conscientious objector when he came
out of the detention camps he said there
has to be a media outlet that is run by
journalists and artists and not
corporations that profit from war and so
Pacifica was born not run by
corporations that George gurbin our
founder of the cultural environment
movement said corporations that have
nothing to tell and everything to sell
that are raising our children today kpfa
was the first Pacifica station founded
in berkeley california in 1949 april
fifteenth nineteen forty nine at three
o'clock Lou Hill went on the air and
welcome people to the airwaves of kpfa
this year as David and I go around the
country celebrating community media
media that is the exception to the
rulers like wz bc from brooklyn college
that broadcast Democracy Now and Boston
College
Boston College and CCTV Cambridge
community television and Newton
community television as well and maybe
some of you can shout out the different
TV stations or radio stations that you
honor and also that broadcast democracy
now we were at three o'clock on April
fifteenth at prison radio project in San
Francisco that was the exact moment that
kpfa went on the air 55 years ago a
young Fresno Bee reporter had asked me
what I would be doing at that moment on
that day this year well the phone rang
and I picked it up there was a recording
warning me that I was about to speak to
a prisoner and then the familiar words
on a move it was Mumia abu-jamal from
death row in Pennsylvania we had a
15-minute conversation every few minutes
it was interview interrupted by the tape
recording warning me that it was a
prisoner and I could hang up if I wanted
to and at the end of the 15 minutes the
phone went dead that was his a lot of
time yes Mumia abu-jamal is on death row
found guilty of a crime he says he is
innocent of I can't think of a more
fitting way to observe Pacifica radios
anniversary than to go to where the
silence is where so many are being held
now two million people in prison in this
country the largest prison population in
the world and on death row thousands of
people we are so used to hearing the
small group of pundits on television who
knows so little about so much
pontificate on every issue but it's our
role as journalists to go as close to
the story as possible to bring you
people describing their experiences for
themselves and so when we talk about
prisons let's hear from prisoners when
we talk about one of the most
controversial policies in this country
that is the death penalty let's hear
from people
on death row Mumia abu-jamal doesn't
talk about his own case he talks about
the situation of people in prison he
talks about the irony of father hunger
that so many young men in prison don't
know their fathers and here he is a
father and grandfather a father figure
to them he can't be that to his own
children he talks about capital
punishment being capital being
punishment for those without capital and
those are the kind of commentaries he
offers us pacifica radio is invaluable
because it is a sanctuary for dissent
would all media should be in this
country after kpfa went on the air from
berkeley kpfk in los angeles and then
WBAI in new york WPF w in washington DC
and k pft in houston texas on the year
nineteen seventy the only radio station
in the country in its first year of
operation its transmitter was blown up
twice by the Ku Klux Klan and when the
exalted Cyclops or was at the Grand
Dragon I often confuse them when on
trial he said it was his proudest act
because he understood how dangerous
pacifica radio is dangerous because it
allows people to speak for themselves
and when you hear someone speaking from
their own experience that breaks down
the stereotypes and the caricatures that
fuel the bigotry that feed hate groups
like the KKK in the 1950s the great
singer actor intellectual scholar
activist Paul Robeson was whitelisted
from almost every place public place in
this country but a few black churches
but he could be heard on kpfa then James
Baldwin the great civil rights activist
and writer debating Malcolm X in the
early 1960s on the effectiveness of
nonviolent civil disobedience the lunch
counter sit-ins in the South broadcast
over the airwaves of WBAI yes it is so
important we have a forum in this
country where people can speak and
people can listen and hear people
a thought actually give a speech here
someone critically think develop a
thought that might be different from
others from beginning to end and break
the soundbite culture eight or nine
seconds we're the only thing you can
repeat is the accepted non wisdom the
establishment consensus I have a lot of
hope because media activism is on the
rise yes the networks are using public
property NBC CBS ABC it's not just
Pacific or NPR or PBS that are using the
public airwaves they are too and they
have a responsibility despite the fact
that during the Persian go for CBS was
owned by Westinghouse NBC was owned by
General Electric two of the major
nuclear weapons manufacturers making
most of the parts for most of the
weapons in the Persian Gulf War what
they presented looked like a military
hardware show despite the fact these
corporations are using these airwaves
they are not and we can reclaim them
where we can demand that they use them
responsibly I often tell a quick story
about my experience during the Persian
Gulf War one night on WBAI after the
news it was during fundraising and I was
railing against the bombing of the
cradle of civilization back to the
cradle and a volunteer ran in who was
taking phone calls and she said the
Sally Jessy Raphael show is on the line
and I said right and I just kept on
going to do really really and she kept
coming in and volunteers are the heart
of every community radio station I just
thought this one was hallucinating so
because she kept interrupting us ok ok
give me the phone I picked it up and
sure enough she was right and there was
a producer from the Sally Jessy Raphael
show she had she said she had been
listening in her limousine I guess her
chauffeur had turned on the program and
she wanted to know if I'd like to come
on the show in two days they wanted to
have a panel discussion about the war
three women for and against the war I
said sure and I you know thought about
what to wear this big you know women's
talk show that Millie
ends of women watch and whether two
dresses a man dressed as a woman dressed
as a man dressed as a woman but I aside
that I figured about and I went on down
and they kept the two groups the ante
and pro women went women into different
green rooms because the shitty said they
wanted us to duke it out on the stage
and only meet then that's where the
fireworks would be and actually this
producer i thought was on to something
she said i am so sick and tired of these
programs these sensational shows that so
many people watch I want to prove we can
get the ratings on an issue that matters
I said you know that's a very good idea
so we went out on the stage and lights
went on music went out Sally came out
and she immediately gave the mic to
someone the audience said I'm really
concerned about the biological and
chemical weapons of Saddam Hussein and
the woman sitting next to me named dr.
yolanda hewitt vaughn an army captain
who was trained as a doctor and she was
refusing to go to the Gulf she said she
was trained to save lives and not take
them she responded she said I share your
concern but I also think it's important
to know that people that there are
chemical and biological weapons right
here in the United stand before she
could get out the word States Sally
world around she came barreling down the
aisle and she was shouting you be quiet
you shut up this is my show or you get
out now I hadn't seen this show very
much but
I remembered what this young producer
said about I want you to get out there
and Duke it out and she was coming down
with such velocity I thought she was
going to strike dr. Yolanda you at
vaughan and so as she is coming up on
the stage I said whoa Sally back off now
they had told us to bring our friends
with us and I brought a bunch of people
from WBAI so they started to chant free
speech free speech you can dress him up
he can't take him anywhere so anyway
Sally started to break down her
producers came out they were rocking her
back and forth and they were saying it's
ok Sally it's ok it was the one moment
of unity for the six women on the stage
who disagreed on every other issue but
we looked in shock and it really was as
she had never heard an anti-war point of
view somehow the producers convinced her
to carry on with the taping of the
program and we went on and she showed
videotape of protesters in Washington
and she asked me who are these people I
know I didn't know everyone's name but I
I I said you know these are people
engaged in their patriotic duty what
they think it is and they are going out
into the streets now I said I applaud
you for not just showing the images of
the protests which is the best we can
expect from the rest of the media and
most people don't identify with ten or a
hundred thousand people marching in the
streets it's rather alienating I think
to most Americans but why do they do it
well they're not invited into a
corporate network studio to explain in a
civilized way say like Henry Kissinger
is invited to explain why he supports
every invasion no they have to gather
together and remember the Persian go for
the middle of winter freezing cold
leasing leaving the warmth of their home
and their families and their TV sets
coming down to Washington and they can
only hope that on a global warming day a
CBS executive might open their window
and that chant of no war will waft in
and hit an open microphone but I really
said to Sally you've gone beyond and
you're having a discussion and I applaud
you for that and we kept on going had
talked about a lot of things I said is
the granddaughter of an Orthodox rabbi
it horrifies me to see little Israeli
children with gas masks but it's more
horrifying to see little Palestinian
children without gas masks and that's
the kind of conversation that we had
my my grandfather isn't alive today he
died about 10 years ago at the age of 90
