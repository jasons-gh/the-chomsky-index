so obviously the last three and a half
months a lot has changed we have but
then some things haven't changed so just
to go through it really quick we're
experiencing the worst pandemic that we
have in over a hundred years the ensuing
economic fallout has been disastrous for
poor and working-class Americans and
people around the world
the situation was perilous before all of
this happen however the current wave of
protests and uprisings have injected
some sense of hope into the population
at large as we just talked about so
what's your take on the current
situation do you see any historical
parallels and is there anything about
the current situation that you find
unique it's quite different anything I
remember since early childhood I grew up
in the depression and the rise of labor
militancy in the early 30s when I was a
kid my my family was mostly all in fact
first-generation immigrants factory
workers unemployed seamstresses loan and
that the feeling of excitement as the
labor movement had been crushed in the
20s but Woodrow Wilson made me really
gone but I was starting to revive CIO
militant strikes Communist Party
Socialist boy a lot of activism a
sensitive it was much cooler than today
which partially no objective but there
was a real sense we're gonna do
something there was a relatively
sympathetic administration now and so
there was an interaction and the real
sense which I'm not going to get out of
this together we don't know exactly but
we're gonna struggle on I haven't seen
anything like that since then as I just
mentioned in the
early days in the civil rights movement
there was a lot of support but very
specific support there was support if
you're going after racist alabama
sheriffs that don't touch us it became
very clear as soon as King began to
shift his activities to the north he was
dead nothing more but even at the early
civil rights movement with all the
enthusiasm
it was pretty thin I just mentioned to
you I was looking at polls recently
David Sirota a great activist published
a lot of early sixties polls and it's
quite striking to see how much
opposition there was to the civil rights
movement even at the peak of enthusiasm
for it you know I have a dream and a
little bit totally different now I mean
things like 2/3 support public support
for black lives matter for the
demonstrations and high military
officers supporting the demonstrations
I've never seen anything like that it's
a real opportunity and I think you're
right that it combines with the hammer
blow of the pandemic and of course
there's something that nobody's talking
about that is much worse we're facing a
catastrophic environmental crisis the
Trump is racing towards it with
dedication if we don't stop that
everything else is moot won't be
anything else to talk about but all this
is converging on an addition to this
Trump is very carefully and consciously
trying to destroy the fundamental formal
structure of the democratic system I
mean the purge of the executive along
with Mitch McConnell's silencing of the
Senate that's really something
nothing like that has happened in 350
years of parliamentary history
well you take a look at the British
constitution it's about a couple a dozen
words it's pay 350 years or based on
good faith and trust pretty much the
same here as a written constitution but
it doesn't deal with particular
contingencies like it doesn't prevent
Trump from calling martial law if he
feels like or firing the whole top
military command many of these things
don't happen because people have some
sense of good faith and trust
so when Nixon couldn't handle it any
longer he didn't call out the army he
left you know it was kind of like a
human being
this guy can't expect that and so for
example things like the purge of the
inspectors general it's an amazing act
here are these guys who were put in by
conservatives Republicans Charles
Grassley mainly his life's work to
supervise the departments to make sure
there's a extreme corruption other
malfeasance
the Trump they start looking into
Trump's swamp hell all of them not a
peep from the Republican Party and he
went out of his way to humiliate
Grassley just like an ordinary tin-pot
dictator well this is 89 year old senior
Republican respected they just smacked
him in the face correctly could write a
letter
nobody backed him up I mean this is
really there's only one I mean anything
that happens so like the scientist in
charge of vaccine production pretty
important now he said something about
Trump's quack medicines helped one
Republican senator Lisa Murkowski said
she's having some doubts about things
came in like a ton of bricks you know
just a hey
dictator people call him fascist I don't
agree doesn't understand what fascism is
he's just a tin pot dictator from some
semicolon and trying to destroy the
country not to destroy the world in fact
has never been anything like this on the
other hand we have these protests never
been anything like it mrs. Colonel could
lead to pretty serious crisis I mean
there is a constitutional crisis in the
background in the United States which is
unavoidable the fir just structural
reasons the a small minority of the
population in rural a traditional
Christian white conservative small
minority maybe twenty percent could run
the government with because of the
radically undemocratic Senate the way in
which you know urban votes are
concentrated other things and there's no
way to avoid it a constitutional
amendment is impossible small states are
blocking so we're really heading to a
major constitutional crisis and Trump is
escalating so we have all these things
converging first of all these
dismantling the arms control system
increasing the threat of nuclear war
environmental catastrophe destruction of
democracy and democratic inversion at
once in an astonishing moment I mean
what will come out of this you can see
on the streets much better than I can
it's certainly amazing but you see in
the short term and we would agree that
it makes the most strategic sense to get
Trump in as many Republicans out of
office in the short term that this isn't
a long-term plan but that the short term
electoral approach should be for people
to strategically vote to get as many
Republicans and Trump out of office
that's a matter of survival
[Music]
in society everything else pales in
consequence that's kind of interesting
about voting you know there's a kind of
an establishment principle about voting
it says politics consists in showing up
every four years all excited and you
know doing a Democratic Duty then go
home and let your betters run things
that's the standard view there's a left
position which seems to have been
forgotten
politics consists of constant and active
agent every once in a while is this
thing called an election okay you take
off couple minutes you see if there's a
difference between the candidates if
there is you vote against the worst one
you know from before anyone because
they're all three often so you vote
against the worst one then you start off
for work again it seems too much
forgotten on the left is consumed by
immersion in the establishment position
you know what should we do in the
election this definitely was obvious
what to do in the election you take five
minutes and you try to save the
countries of the world from destruction
they go back to work we shouldn't even
be talking about but it's the big issue
on the Left it's a very strange
submission to establishment ideology all
of this would take five minutes then you
go back to work and the activism has
been effective I mean take a look at
Biden's
electoral program that's way to the left
of any Democrat since FDR not because
that's what he decided he wanted him
just because actually so pounding on the
doors well I think Sanders is doing just
the right thing no he's in there he's
got his he's got his guys on me the
Commission's on the Planning
Commission's there is suppressing more
than the program six people left okay
that's what you keep doing meanwhile
keep organizing all the way up and down
I mean Obama for example from dispose
just out of personal arrogance basically
destroyed the party
nothing happened to local levels state
levels
Republicans understood and they took
over school board state legislature
that's what making this have to do none
of the Koreans have missed Alan is very
you know they mostly show every for you
and we've seen that here in Indiana
back in 2008 Noam we had the first time
Indiana went blue in 44 years was in
2008 we haven't went blue since then in
a presidential election that entire
infrastructure was dismantled after 2008
and then of course on the heels of that
we have the Tea Party Citizens United
gerrymandering now I'm gonna jump ahead
a bit but I wanted to we worked very
hard on the Bernie campaign not only
because we wanted Sanders in the White
House but we saw this as an opportunity
to connect with people ordinary
Americans who don't self-identify as
progressives or leftist who are getting
involved with the political process for
the first time now you can kind of tell
me if you think we were naive or not but
we thought at the time that this perhaps
was the last chance for us to get
someone elected through the Democratic
Party to potentially reform the party to
take to to the extent that you want to
spend time on electoral politics for
people to really push of course after
South Carolina right on the heels of
South Carolina we have the pandemic and
then everything that's followed one of
the questions all of the serious
organizers that I know have been asking
is what is this vehicle for change that
yes we have NGOs many of whom are not
very useful but there are some who are
useful labor unions seem to have been
the traditional vehicle for this kind of
change we see an upsurge in labor
organizing groups like the DSA and the
United electrical workers are doing
workplace organizing as we speak in fact
the people we have inside of the
say that we know said that there's
actually more requests for workplace
organizing than they can fulfill which
is a both good and bad I think a lot of
us are asking today what is that sort of
organizational vehicle that we could use
is it labor unions is it community
organizations is it a new party is it
the exist the existing that's okay maybe
he was answering he was answering the
question I think he was trying to tell
us which vehicle was for change you know
there's another point to make about
labor organizing to take the teacher
strikes yeah it's pretty astonishing um
West Virginia Arizona
no no unions you know conservatives
what's cold conserve it I think it's not
bright below the surface
these guys have got an enormous support
public support all over the place
Wow not just calling for better wages
they're calling for doing something
about the schools yeah man the whole
neoliberal period one of the top planks
has been to destroy public education
since defunded it you know too many kids
in a class and counselors there's
nothing put it all in a private setting
so these teachers are fighting back and
say we want a vigorous functioning
educational system getting into the book
breaking into the legislature getting
some results and that goes back to your
point what you said maybe naive that
gets made of trying to reach people they
don't call themselves progressives do
these people go but they are no it's
just you know differently formulated and
as soon as they start pressing for more
the communities control teachers control
better schools so they got the whole
community behind them
Oh common twosome you can see it at a
lot of things I mean when I moved here
from Boston I thought it's gonna be
politically dead it's the opposite I
think it's more politically alive than
Boston all kinds of things the way we're
not far from Mexico so once half the
population the mexican-american there's
volunteers who go into the desert leave
bottles of water for refugees now they
come up for federal trial they're
exonerated by the jury
local people it's not a crime to leave
water bottles for migrants doesn't sound
like I mean you also have the gated
communities where they're raising money
to build a private wall to save us from
the rapists and so on but you have both
and you have signs on people's lawns all
over are saying the humanitarian aid is
not a crime these are not people you'd
call progressive but they really are I
think most people are it's just right
below the surface has to be brought down
so I think that's exactly that all and I
think you're right that deep you know
the extravaganza it does give an
opportunity to go out and talk to people
meet them get them together get them to
organize communities workplaces and
cooperatives all sorts of things and I
don't know if you're in the areas where
neck systems project is working girl
services work around not around their
ports of most of the parts of the Rust
Belt around Cleveland and so on
Youngstown oh there's a big or has been
working on it's really important trying
to set up you know after the bankers in
New York and Chicago through sent the
industries abroad started off with
small enterprises worker-owned
enterprises that link themselves to the
service economy that's developing so
like Cleveland it's you know hospitals
educational institutions and so on they
need things like laundries so there's a
worker on laundry Enterprise that serves
them there's quite a proliferation of
these I think it's called the next
systems project I will one of the things
I was thinking as you were as you were
speaking is there seems to be I get very
frustrated when I hear people on the
Left talk about how all Americans are
dumb or these people are dumb or what I
mean we're in the streets constantly we
live in a Rust Belt town that's just
plagued by systemic poverty segregation
opioid addiction we've got a
maximum-security prison we've got a
minimum security prison we've got a
coal-fired power plant one of our top
sources of revenue is a casino which is
closed right now because of the pandemic
so we're just losing money like crazy as
a city it's as bad as it gets the only
places I could think that would be worse
our places like Gary Indiana Immokalee
Florida or maybe some native
reservations you know that the situation
here is about as intense as it can get
yet most of the people we speak with on
the streets fully understand that the
system is corrupt to the bone they don't
buy into it they don't buy into a lot of
the nationalism they don't buy into a
lot of the stuff but they there is a
sense that maybe nothing can be done
about it
so our step to do something obviously is
to get them organized to get them
thinking about coal activity that
they're not just in this on their own
you know if they lose their house or
they lose their job it's just them and
their family and they have to figure it
out I think one of the steps is to
empower get people organized and let get
them to understand that they will have
power if they organize collectively but
a conversation that I consistently have
with with our friend Michael Albert is
that that sometimes run-ins runs into a
barrier because at some point people do
want to know or develop what is it that
we actually
you know and beyond maybe something like
we can get people to agree Medicare for
all we can get a lot of people to agree
on the green new deal but I think what
would surprise some people on the left
is the degree to which many poor and
working-class people even have more
sophisticated questions like if we
implement the green New Deal who gets to
call the shots who gets to make these
decisions
what do you think about that is that
something that you've noticed over the
years as well time in fact one of the
things I constantly push is to get
people to ask why do you
what's good about having a job take
having a job that means being under the
totalitarian control of a master or
you're almost every waking hour at a
level that Stalin couldn't have
conceived of Stalin didn't say you can
go to the bathroom at three o'clock for
five minutes or you have to wear this
clothes not that other clothes but you
can't stop to talk to your friend that's
having a job what's so great about that
why should we even be tolerated in fact
let's look a little bit about
working-class history the 19th century
that workers bitterly condemned this I
mean it was so overwhelmingly condemned
that the Republican Party commended
neighbor him Lincoln's Republican Party
one of its slogans was that wage labor
is the same as slavery except that it's
temporary until you become a free person
again why can't we go back to the
mentality of the 19th century workers in
fact for 2,000 years back to classical
Greece the idea that you'd be dependent
on another person was the ultimate
abysmal situation of course you know if
they thought it was fine for slaves and
women but we're beyond that right but
why should anybody be dependent and I
think this strikes a chord why should we
why shouldn't in fact in the early
thirties going
to my members one of the things that
really excited people was the sit-down
strikes a sit-down strike is one step
before saying we don't need you guys
we'll take the factory over and run it
ourselves better than you can I think
that's you know we've come very close to
that so for example take 2008 about 2009
Obama essentially nationalized the auto
industry now there were a couple of
paths that one of them is give it back
to the former owner and he's let them
build stuff that's destroying them
smaller car he's wrong sure that's the
one they took there was another give it
over to the workforce with the subsidies
are giving the financial industry
financial institutions give support them
to do something we need like mass public
transportation I think that could have
been done if there was public awareness
about the issues well you see it on a
small scale so I'm sure you've seen this
where you are but I was in Boston so the
small town outside of Boston town couple
years ago where there was a some
Enterprise pretty profitable that was
building sophisticated parts for the
airplanes now the multinational who
owned it decided it wasn't making enough
profit so they candid of the Union which
was a you know I didn't think it might
have been Electrical Workers Union I
said okay we'll buy it from you we'll
just buy the plan we'll take it over
it's kind of interesting what happened
for the multinational that would have
been profitable but they didn't allow
him for class reasons they're not stupid
they don't want these ideas to get
around so they were willing to take the
loss to keep reworking workers from
buying it now if there had been any
community support they could have won
but Boston's a pre activist community
most of them I think that's a barrier we
have to overcome there are a lot of
cases like as I've seen quite a few of
them and it's very interesting to see
the class consciousness of the ruling
class they understand they'd rather lose
money than have the idea of
self-ownership take root and I think
they understand it's not very fuller
actually I don't know if you followed
the Davos conference last January it was
pretty interesting
no this January affair world rich guys
get together go skiing so this year was
different there was a theme that ran
through it saying we gotta watch out
there's what they call reputational risk
you know the guys are coming after us
so they put out a statement about how we
realized we've done bad things in the
past you know hang on a for tension to
the public we were too greedy now we've
learned our lesson we're gonna be good
citizen you can trust us they're scared
they know it I mean there's a memo
leaked from JPMorgan Chase recently the
morning that they ought to stop funding
fossil fuels because people are turning
against them they're gonna get into
trouble after all of that earth signs
that the pressure in the activism are
working everything from teacher strikes
today you know multinationals and I
think it's a moment when that could be
brought together organized I think Mike
is right you wanna have some picture of
the future but my feeling is we've
argued about these figures are Nicky the
details that they go into I think too
much can give guidelines and basic ideas
things have to be worked up and so I'm
here actually trigati with marks
University I think he went before now
anything about post-capitalist society
but the idea was when working before
free from capitalist shackles they'll
figure it out for themselves then you
have to experiment we don't know enough
state we don't have all the answers we
don't know that this is going to work
that's going to work you try it out but
the basic ideas I think are clear the
people order direct control their own
lives their own institutions shouldn't
be any hierarchies they shouldn't be any
bullets from anywhere makes you should
be like the populist movement in the
late 19th century no it's real it was
most radical Democratic movement in
American history and farmers from Texas
Oklahoma and Kansas decided we don't
want to have to borrow money from rich
bankers in Boston and New Jersey is
interest rates and have them market of
crops will give it ourselves we'll set
up our own banks their own marketing
system will run it all ourselves only
they were crushed by force but it was a
major mother that's and that's
mainstream America you know somebody she
can't get more mainstream than that you
know my feeling is that's just below the
surface everyone it's what you what you
described is learning true people just
feels hopeless can't fight city oh but
you can and I mean you know this is a
hundred times better than ninety dude
just get some small victory maybe yeah
get some mothers together and get a
traffic light with the kids go to school
okay we can do something that's Boeing
the next we've got you take the whole
thing
a whole system of control is either very
fragile depends on people's
subordination say we throw that consent
so quick like the sit-down strikes or
the auto industry in 2008 it's just on
the verge of big changes have you been
surprised at speaking of class
consciousness and I want to get back to
the two
I think we're poor and working-class
people are coming from what were what
we're seeing on the ground and what
we're experiencing have you been
surprised at the state's inability to
respond in the short term to the
financial distress people are under in
other words I was somewhat surprised
that the state wouldn't step in and at
least give people even menial coverage
like Co vid 19 coverages taken care of
and maybe we'll give you a couple grand
a month for the next six months
Michael Albert's point is maybe along
the lines of what you're saying which is
the rich are so class conscious that
they didn't even want people to get a
taste of what it would be like to
perhaps get a couple grand a month from
the government or injury yeah it's
dangerous if you get the sense that the
state can do something for you that it
could be your government not their
government and that can go on it's the
domino theory basically the same in
international relations now why do you
have to destroy Grenada if they have
local control over fishing can't
tolerated in fact the weaker the country
the more dangerous it is so you have to
go after you know levels Grenada in any
small place it's kinda like the Mafia
like if some small grocery store says
I'm not gonna pay protection money that
the godfather doesn't need the money
but he's gonna send in his goons to beat
the shit out of them because you can't
let people get the idea you can do
something for yourself and I think we
have a very class conscious business
class they take every opportunity to
make sure that nobody gets the wrong
ideas so guess what's going on with a
stimulus bill tha's it's just shocking
and the Democrats are in with it I mean
there's supposed to be a supervisor for
the cares program I think it's a couple
hundred days no nobody's appointed of
course
mitch mcconnell's not gonna let anything
go through the senate but the democrats
could do it themselves pelosi schumer
that's not giving
okay so you know no channel supervise it
you know where that's gonna go exactly
where we see it but so yes they're very
class conscious I think he's right you
see it all the time that's why I mean
they would save money if you had
medicine if you had a universal
healthcare they would save money it's
costly for them we don't want to we'd
rather lose the money and have it all
privatized don't have people get the
idea you can get together and do
something for yourself this is is this
the same concept
pertaining to prisons as well in other
words you know there's a lot of folks
where we're dealing with a horrific
situation at our local prison that's
become a kovat hotbed in the state it's
horrific conditions for the people or
inside we just spoke with an inmate
yesterday on the phone from inside the
prison the conditions are worse than the
Iraqi prisoners that we had in Iraq
there's a sense among the activists who
are out there fighting against these
conditions and fighting for those
prisoners that this is all about profit
but the reality is that a very small
percentage of prisons in the United
States are actually privatized so there
are these other functions these sort of
disciplinary functions that capitalists
that the state you know does to people
and in the service of people who are in
power
why do you do is there a read this isn't
necessarily that important but I'm just
interested to see why do you think that
is that we no longer talk about those
sort of like functions that the state
and that the rich elites do that aren't
necessarily just to make themselves
money but to keep people in line I mean
there's no the left has a lot of left
activism but it's it's kind of focused
on specific things doesn't look at the
roots of the problem so it takes a
defendant
there's been almost no discussion of
what the roots of it or and there were
submit are transparent it's a capitalist
catastrophe I mean the drug debt was
known in 2003 perfectly we'll know an
answer sores that there's another
pandemic coming probably coronavirus
scientists knew what to do about it
drug companies wouldn't do anything
straight capitalist logic no profit and
preparing for a catastrophe in ten years
from now so will we make money on
tomorrow government could step in in
principle that's blocked by
neoliberalism which says government's
not allowed to do anything they have to
hand it over to private power so they
are out so nothing was done I mean
there's a lot more which it's worse but
made it worse but that's the core of it
and that's replicating itself right now
there's gonna be another pandemic be
worse than this one we know what has to
be done about it
drug companies won't do it government so
let it come almost no discussion of this
and it's not quantum physics just
waiting for me to rise like most things
or what's in front of your eyes that a
job is pure totalitarianism but people
want to get a job what alternative is
ative i think if you think about it for
30 seconds yeah she's crazy
why should we be bossed around by some
guy all of our waking hours that's like
how about the class relations within the
left I'll tell you as someone who grew
up as a son of an ironworker my mom
worked part-time jobs I grew up with a
good class consciousness good Union
politics strong Union politics didn't
know much about gender or sexuality or
race politics I you know those were
things I learned is I got older went to
university got involved with different
left movements and over the years I've
seen
LGBTQ activists I think get more of a
position within the left I've seen black
activists and scholars have more of a
position within these left institutions
it seems to me that class is still a
major barrier that many of the left
institutions conferences that I've been
to protests events have been asked to
speak at I'll often afterwards try and
speak with some of the people who are
there many of them very nice people with
good intentions but whose day-to-day
reality is starkly different than what
I've experienced since I came home from
the Marine Corps and my life before the
Marine Corps what do you think we can do
and how do you think the left would
change if we sort of overcome this class
barrier and do you see that as a barrier
is this something that I'm just reading
too much into look I don't I don't live
the life of the factory worker okay okay
I don't live the life of the guy who
fixes the motor in my car but doesn't
mean you can't be equals working
together efficient so are things each
producing what you can do I mean
perfectly possible so for example it in
the earlier period early 30s again was
mainly the Communist Party but left
intellectuals in the Communist Party
just regarded as part of their life to
be involved in worker education programs
knowing sure that's what you do my my
own family were and I like your
background wearing clothes a lot of them
that barely went to school you know
never got best fourth grade the very
educated people they they went to his
class that estate was mostly through the
unions went to concerts you know went to
Shakespeare plays that were put on by
WPA actors in central for it's just part
of their life there's the same in the
19th century illiterate and illiterate
Irish blacksmiths in Boston the end
little extra money would pay a boy to
read them things that we know regard as
classics the English literature the day
I mean that could be part of every
person's life and they can contribute to
it they're gonna be writers they can you
know he takes a lose and jazz and they
came from the most repressed viciously
repressed sectors of it had ever
appeared in the world was the source of
some of the most creative music the two
on this point we opened this community
center in 2017 and the reason we opened
this community center there's multiple
reasons one is that we've seen that too
much of the activism has been online and
there is ability to mobilize so Sergio
and I came back from Standing Rock we
traveled there with different
organizations like Veterans for Peace
and other groups that were involved we
went there with largely a contingent of
veterans when we got to Standing Rock
it was amazing to us that there were
thousands of veterans from across the
country but what we found was that
virtually none of them were members of
organizations and that when they were
going home they were going home to
virtually nothing in terms of an
organizing infrastructure so when we
came back from Standing Rock on the
heels of Donald Trump's victory it
became clear to us that one of the
things that's needed is a space a space
that's open 7 days a week that people
can come to to socialize to not just I
mean we hold organizing events workshops
campaigns you know organizing meetings
to actually do actions but we also have
barbecues we watch boxing matches you
know we have people come we do the kind
of things that I think we need to do to
build the kind of bonds and trust that
you need in order to engage in serious
political work so in other words there's
people at Standing Rock saying hey
brother are you ready to die with me and
I'm like well I don't even know your
last name you know maybe we maybe we
should take a step back you know and
build the kind of infrastructure and
foundation that's needed can you talk a
little bit about this the vibrant
culture that you did grow up in
the importance of spaces like this to
make this a regular part of people's
lives very much what you're describing
so takes a the two of my aunt's were
seamstresses they worked of course they
were unemployed then but you know they
worked these were horrible conditions
you know about them but they were
members of the international label
garment workers union ladies garment
workers union know there was a union
whole there were political parties a lot
of it the Communist Party no they had
exactly what you described and not just
workers education but parties concerts
and they got a week in the Catskill
Mountains to be oil under the Union it
was just their lives it was a very
enriching money and it was over you talk
about a space
it was the Union for in fact I notice
that when I travel around the world just
about every country in the world when I
give talks it's often in the Union more
Canada England Mexican anyway not here
you can't give a talk in a union hall
here Thatcher and Reagan or whoever was
giving them their instructions knew what
they were doing first act destroy the
unions Thatcher
there's no society make sure that people
are atomized separated no Union holds no
place for people to get together you're
all on your own in the market you know
they that's me that's right thank you
Marx talked about it when he was
condemning the autocratic rulers of the
mid 19th century
he said they want to turn the population
into a sack of taters people who item a
lot of money
vitamin atomized separated from one
another alone nowhere to get together no
space I mean even the boulevards and
Paris when they were rebuilt were
designed so that people couldn't get
together University architecture since
the seven sixties has been designed this
is a book almost all over the world so
there aren't any open spaces there's a
way to get from here to there but no
spell closet you know we don't want
people to get together so I think
fingers on the basic problem we should
reestablish spaces where people live
maybe card games parties barbecues
educational center meetings to organize
the tactics for tomorrow but all of
these things that's the center of your
life and that's where the dominant comes
in that's Fred's if we can organize this
part of our lives we can take over the
rest of it too now why not just take
over the factories and the enterprises
and why not just get rid of the hedge
funds and private equity funds we don't
want that garbage they get rid of the
financial institutions they're just
predatory and then do anything set up a
community bank do postal more important
thing very important is to try to save
the post office yeah these
class-conscious gangsters want to
destroy it the post not just because it
doesn't give them profit the post office
is a community service it's a place
where people get together and talk to
each other you get to know your letter
carrier and if you're sick they maybe
they'll bring you a sandwich or
something it's just a community
operation and it's people running
something for themselves which works
which is effective the very efficient
wrong idea we don't want to have people
have that idea that is another point
that could be revived forgotten beaten
out of people head why do we have a post
office when you go back to the 1780s
what it was it in the Constitution
because it was a way that was the way
the founders interpreted the First
Amendment the post office was a subsidy
to the press almost everything that went
through the post office was cheap
distribution of an independent press
it's a subsidy to ensure that we have a
lively free press last thing these guys
want they don't want to hear about that
I mean the United States is the business
class is so class conscious we don't
even have public radio and television
like they have everywhere you know you
don't have I mean everywhere else in the
world I can be on a discussion program
on mainstream television I'm here maybe
you get three seconds between two
commercials you know we want to make
sure that nothing is done that lets
people believe you can do things for
yourself
it's a concerted program we have to
understand it and we have to fight
against it at the root and take the post
office again I mean that could be used
for banking instead of going to you know
Chase Manhattan what you do is go to the
local post office where they can handle
small deposits no no bureaucracy no
conditions you know no usury just put
your money and you get it back it's as
funds the local stores and all of that's
possible of course voting by mail is
also possible get around the
gerrymandering and the voter suppression
so the post stuff itself just one thing
but it can be a basis for development
the same with everything else I mean it
takes a universal health care I mean you
know if people are brought to see what
it is they're appalled so for example
the u.s. does have universal health care
we have it
it's called emergency rooms you can drag
yourself to an emergency room
they'll think area let's you just go to
an emergency room you see what it's like
or the Veterans Administration Hospital
I don't mean to cut you off
but I mean even the VA I mean we use the
VA as a model as flawed as it is my
friends who have private insurance when
I tell them about my experience is going
to the VA showing them my veterans card
no bills no paperwork getting my care
and going home it blows their mind and
before it was defunded it was a very
efficient organization had better a
better medical care than the regular
hospitals - I have a friend who happened
to be in need air force rotc no never
been in combat but he had a very bad
fall he's he was totally paralyzed
literally he could barely move his
eyebrows no he's he's got he's gotten
tens of thousands of support from the VA
equipment the training he's no
functioning full-time and said electrum
complicated cherries it's anybody gets
around
he's a functioning human being most of
the VA because he was in the ROTC years
I know I'm probably being selfish with
you and your dog probably also wants you
to get the heck off of this phone call
unfortunately oh do you I apologize can
I ask you just one more thing just to
round it out for folks if you if you
could know there's you know Sergio and I
are 36 years old now a lot of the people
that we got involved with have went on
to other things they've moved on they've
been burnt out they've been beat up
jailed all kinds of things that come
with this work what's your advice to
this new generation of activists and
organizers they're just getting in the
street they just got involved with the
Bernie campaign they're experiencing all
of this what's your advice for them to
stay disciplined to stay involved in the
movement and to keep up this work but
the only advice I can think of is to
tell them that they are they have a
responsibility than a privilege that has
never existed in human history we're at
a moment in human history where it will
be decided whether organized life will
persist on earth literally that's a
burden and a privilege they have the
future in their hands there are plenty
of opportunities much better than in the
past a lot of battles have been won the
kind of thing you were struggling about
in the 60s a lot of it you don't worry
about anymore so yes women have rights
yes we can't have segregated housing by
federal law yes we can't have anti
sodomy laws all this has been one you're
starting from a higher plane because
young people in the past didn't give up
now it's your turn you got a much better
bigger task to perform a vastly more
important one you can do it we have some
time not a lot of time let's just grasp
the opportunities run with them that's
the only advice I know thanks for your
time no I really do appreciate it great
to be with you

you yeah keep in touch
