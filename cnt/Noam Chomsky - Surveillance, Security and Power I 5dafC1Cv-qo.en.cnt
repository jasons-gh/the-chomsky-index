I think there are the two things to bear
in mind about that the first thing is
that the phenomenon itself shouldn't be
at all surprising the second is that the
scale at least to me is kind of
surprising hadn't really expected that
scale but the phenomenon is normal and
it's again as American as apple pie now
you can go back to a century that take
say the Philippine war early in the 19th
century 20th century there was a vicious
war the u.s. conquered the Phylis to
fill the Philippines killed a hundred
thousand people was a major popular
nationalist movement after the military
victory it had to be suppressed and
controlled and a huge pacification
campaign was initiated using the highest
technology of the day for surveillance
subversion at breaking up groups you
know building up hostilities all kinds
of things a very sophisticated it was
very quickly transferred home it was
used by Woodrow Wilson and Red Scare the
worst repression in American history and
developed further sins it's had a lethal
effect on the Philippines
you know people mourn the typhoon that
killed tens of thousands of people that
doesn't happen in functioning societies
it's very striking in the Caribbean that
when a tropical storm goes through the
Caribbean and Haiti are the major
victims of Imperial violence it's a
vicious they're right next door in Cuba
three people die you know some buildings
are knocked over the same storm depends
on the society
well the Philippines is a society that
we created have maintained it's the one
part of Southeast Asia that hasn't taken
part in the so-called Asian miracle you
know the not one of the Asian Tigers
there's a reason for that
good reason but these techniques but you
can be confident that any state or a
commercial enterprise any system of
power is going to use whatever
technology is available to try to
control and dominate its and what
amounts to its major enemy namely the
population that's what power systems are
going to do the scale of what was
revealed I think was a little surprising
but it actually shouldn't be and there's
more to come those of you who read
technical journals like say the MIT
Technology Review they should know
what's coming so for example just in the
tech review recently there's been
articles on things like there and
elsewhere on the hardware and computers
which is now being designed they blame
China but of course that means it's
being done 10 times as much year to put
in components in the hardware that will
enable the manufacturer to record every
keystroke everything that's happening on
your computer American businesses are
worried because if they have Chinese
computers they'll be picking it up at
the People's Liberation Army but they
don't point out that the American
systems are from them doubtless much
more advanced than doing the same thing
robotics is a field that's been worked
on pretty hard for many years here too
and one of the goals quite explicit
nothing secret is to develop a fly sized
drones tiny robots which can you know
get on your on the ceiling of your
living room and carry out constant
surveillance and drones tend to go from
surveillance to lethal capacities very
quickly so we can expect that pretty
soon and these are things that are in
development any system of power is going
to use them and pretty strikingly
your hotties are going to use them but
one of the things we're doing right now
is creating perfect technology for
terrorist attacks it's not a secret you
take a look at drone technology but
right by today already it's claimed that
for a $300 you can purchase a small
drone online
well that's improving very fast and for
terrorist activities just perfect if you
want to get a picture of it there's an
article in this month's leading journal
of Foreign Affairs and Britain the Royal
Institute Journal of International
Affairs describing how we are rapidly
creating the technology to permit the
massive terrorist attacks on ourselves
that's also typical power systems that
seek short term power and domination
they are not concerned with security
it's contrary to academic dogma you can
easily show that they're interested in
power domination the the wealthy the
welfare of their primary domestic
constituencies which are wealth
concentrated wealth and if there's a
disaster in the long term it's not their
business you can show that with them
it's obvious with environmental issues
it's the same with nuclear weapons the
same right now with their own technology
so sure this stuff is going to go on
unless we stop it
you can stop it - doesn't have to go on
