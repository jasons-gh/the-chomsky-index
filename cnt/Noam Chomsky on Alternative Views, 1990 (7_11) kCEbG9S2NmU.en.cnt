in political discourse every term has
two meanings you got to start by
recognizing that so democracy has an
official meaning which is something like
you know the ability of the public to
take part and running around affairs or
something but it also has a technical
meaning the one that's actually used
something is democracy if it's run by
the business classes if business runs it
especially business elements they're
supportive of us interests then it's
democracy if not it's not a democracy
doesn't matter nothing else matters
virtually you'll check you'll notice
that this criterion works quite
perfectly for identifying democracy same
is true of the term peace process it has
a dictionary meaning in the dictionary
meaning a peace process is some kind of
process that's trying to lead towards
peace but it also has a technical
meaning the technical meaning in its
technical meaning it refers to whatever
the United States happens to be
advocating at a particular moment
wherever diplomatic initiatives the
United States is advocating that's the
peace process notice it follows that
it's a logical impossibility for the
United States to be opposed to the peace
process that's a nice consequence you to
prove that the United States is for
peace you don't have to do any laborious
inquiry into the annoying facts because
it's true by definition since the peace
process is whatever the United States is
up to the United States always
supporting peace and the US enemies are
always opposed to peace because they're
not supporting what the US is up to and
by definition that means they're opposed
to peace you'll never find in the US
media or for that matter in u.s.
scholarship for the most part any such
phrase as the United States is opposing
the peace process the United States is
trying to block the peace process you
can't find such statements because
they'd be logical contradictions
actually made this statement and a talk
in Seattle a couple of months ago and
there is a media analysis group in the
graduate school there and a couple weeks
later I got a letter from somebody
saying he was kind of intrigued so he
did a data based study of the New York
Times over 10 years and he found i don't
know like nine
references the peace process and check
them all out and in fact there's not one
case where the United States was opposed
to the peace process pretty remarkable
because that was a period when the
United States was trying to undermine
the diplomatic negotiations and
settlement in Central America and in the
Middle East and so on notice that's
pretty remarkable even the most sublime
state you'd expect that it wouldn't
always be in favor of the police peace
process maybe just by error or
misunderstanding but in the case of the
United States it's 100 I suspect it's a
hundred percent you might check and see
if you can find any exception and the
reason is it's just true by definition
since the priest process is whatever we
do now there are two major examples of
peace processes in process now one of
them's in the Middle East and ones in
Central America there's no time to go
through the details but if you look
you'll notice that in the Middle East
the United States has been trying to
block a diplomatic settlement for the
path of the arab-israeli conflict for
the past 20 years and it's still trying
to block it and in this is virtually
isolated in world opinion that's exactly
what's going on now if you like I'll
give you some details I have a detailed
discussion of it than the current issue
of zeemagazine if you're interested but
I think it's quite clear nevertheless
the discussion is the United States is
trying to advance the peace process
there's another peace process going on
in Central America which is no less
interesting read you from the front page
of the New York Times today the lead
story in The New York Times today which
picked up on the airplane says US envoy
urges Hondurans to let the Contras stay
okay let them stay in Honduras the track
you come out and then comes a long story
and you turn to the second page the
continuation page and it says on its
face the administration proposal to keep
the Contras in place would seem to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
regional peace agreement which calls for
their relocation but administration
officials say there is no inconsistency
well that's about as close as you can
come you know on its face it seems to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
peace agreement well the peace agreement
is quite explicit the 1987 peace
agreement which you know
has succeeded in undermining and
destroying says explicitly that the one
indispensable element in obtaining peace
in the region is the end of any form of
support logistical military
propagandistic etc for irregular forces
like the Contras now it's not it doesn't
seem to be inconsistent with the spirit
but it's flatly inconsistent with the
words to keep the Contras in Prague
placed well the same is true of
everything else about that the there was
a there's that was the 1987 peace
agreement which the United States tried
to undermine and did undermine the
support of the media but there are
others there's a right now there's
debate going on on so-called
humanitarian aid to the Contras well the
term humanitarian aid has a meaning in
fact the World Court and its decision
defines humanitarian aid it you look up
paragraph 243 of the World Court
decision and it defines humanitarian aid
as aid given for the hallowed purposes
of the Red Cross namely to relieve human
suffering and crucially it says aid that
is given without discrimination to
civilians on all sides of any conflict
only under such conditions that anything
qualifies humanitarian aid well that
means all the stuff given is called
humanitarian aid has nothing to do with
humanitarian aid its military but you'll
never find this discussed in the media I
doubted he'd find one reference to this
in the media so now we're talking about
humanitarian aid that's going to be
voted the Bush administration hopes to
keep the countries in place in violation
of the 1987 agreement well it was also a
Central American presidents agreement
just last month and that said something
to it said the Contras have to be
relocated away from Honduras so this is
flatly inconsistent with that not the
spirit but the wording furthermore there
was a ceasefire agreement between
Nicaragua and the Contras last March
over the deep objections of the United
States last March twenty third and that
ceasefire agreement has some very
specific terms in it it says that
it can continue to go to the Contras in
cease fire zones all of which are in
Nicaragua when provided by a neutral
agency that's what the wording of the
agreements is Congress passed
legislation right after that sent to
send what they call humanitarian aid to
the Contras but if you look at the
legislation it says specifically that it
must be in accord with the ceasefire
agreement and it must be in accord with
Central American peace agreement well
that means that the only aid that
Congress could legally send to the
Contras in accordance with its own
legislation is aid given by a neutral
agency like the Red Cross to Contras in
cease fire zones inside Nicaragua that's
not just my interpretation the ceasefire
agreement also specified an
international official in charge of
monitoring the agreement it's a
secretary general of the Organization of
American States he wrote a letter to
President Secretary of State George
Shultz stating that the aid that the
United States was sending was
inconsistent with the ceasefire
agreement and he was wanted to call the
attention of the Secretary of State to
this serious violation of the ceasefire
agreement and the Congressional
legislation I was never recorded
Congress proceeded to send the aid the
neutral agency that they selected was US
aid State Department subsidiary that's
the US that's the neutral agency and
they're sending it illegally to Honduras
in fact the aid that they're sending is
not only in caen flatly inconsistent
with the Central American peace
agreement it's even in consistent with
Congress's own legislation that's pretty
tricky you'll never find one word of
discussion about this this is against
the background of years of the United
States trying to undermine every effort
at political settlement of that of those
conflicts whether they were through the
contadora group of Latin American
democracies are the United Nations or
the Security Council over the United
States vetoed resolutions calling on all
states to support international law and
so on and it continues but nevertheless
according to the media the press the
United States government is supporting
the peace process well
I'm suggesting that wherever you look if
you look closely you'll find exactly the
same thing you'll find quite a
remarkable degree of civility and
subordination to established power
particularly remarkable because there's
no force behind thee there's no
authority that can impose force this is
willing subservience not compelled
subservience and the kind that in fact
flows I think just from the the logic of
the institutions for the reasons that I
mentioned well let me return finally to
a prediction of the propaganda model
that I mentioned already namely that
however well confirm that is it cannot
be part of the discussion it's going to
got to remain outside the spectrum of
debate and respectable circles maybe
with some very marginal exceptions the
reasons are the ones I mentioned they're
pretty obvious that conclusion again is
quite well established empirically and I
think we may assume with fair degree of
confidence that that will continue to be
the case
