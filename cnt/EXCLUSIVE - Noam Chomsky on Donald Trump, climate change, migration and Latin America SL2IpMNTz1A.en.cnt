welcome to this meeting in London of 500
trade unionists academics and general
latin-american enthusiasts I know all of
us are so glad to hear from you talking
about this area that you know so well do
you want to just greet them yes I wish I
could be with you in person sorry this
is the best I could manage never mind
your voice is with us and that's us so
you know we just see the Trump
administration's policies of threats and
bullying towards the region's
progressive groups how do you see that
playing out notably towards Mexico where
the pressures have put on the government
to take the Mexican government to take
responsibility for all the refugees
seems the most extraordinary
heavy-handed behavior u.s. is rather
like Europe is trying to force people
fleeing for their lives away from US
borders it's particularly grotesque in
the u.s. case because but not only
because the United States is a rich
extremely privileged country with
extraordinary advantages no other
country has plenty of empty space not a
dense population could easily absorb
many refugees furthermore these are
refugees fleeing from u.s. crimes of the
United States of them both through this
but there's a long horrible record which
have peaked in the 1980s with Ronald
Reagan's
violent terrorist wars in Central
America virtually destroyed the
countries left that horrendous legacy
people are still fleeing from it for a
period the plurality of refugees was
actually coming from Honduras where the
Obama administration's accorded a
military coup in 2009 that overthrew a
mildly progressive government leading
turning Honduras into it even for worse
our camper than
was virtually the murder capital of the
world so yes people are fleeing when
they come to the border they're treated
horribly I have to live in Tucson not
too far from the border people our
people are dying in the in the desert
they're trying to escape the border
guards the now the policy is to keep
them away from the border altogether by
coercing Mexico and to banning them at
its borders with the Guatemala and
insisting that if they come to Mexico of
course they have to to get the United
States they have to ask for asylum there
and cannot ask for it me and I played
all of these I don't think go through it
but the record in Europe is similar and
he's worse these are really shocking
developments right now where I live in
fact there are federal cases in the
federal court against with felony
charges against them
solidarity workers who are leaving going
into the desert to leave problems of
water for people that are dying of
starvation and thirst in the very
difficult conditions and is it there
fortunately there are courageous
activists solidarity movements but it's
nowhere near enough to put an end to
this obscenity the Mexico's in a very
difficult position I'm sure you've heard
the famous statement that Mexico's
problem is that it's too far from God
and too close to the United States in
fact where I happened to be sitting
right now was stolen from Mexico and I'm
war of aggression it's it's very good to
have that historical reminder of how
long these crimes have gone on in one
shape or another can I just ask you to
turn now to your assessment of the
continents trends to
day with the National revolt including
so many middle-class demonstrators in
places like Chile against the pain of
what neoliberalism has bought how do you
assess when you look at the continent
how do you feel about the balance of
forces today we should bear in mind that
it's not just the Western Hemisphere the
whole world is seeing uprisings of all
kinds many you take a look at each
country in each area it's got its own
reasons but there's an underlying
constant element that is the impact of
the neoliberal assault on the general
population in Europe the United States
much of those global South for the past
generation in Chile the slogan which I'm
sure you've heard of the demonstrators
is it's not about 30 patients it's about
30 years namely the fact that the
horrible legacy of the dishes you know
she ate regime the first major exercise
in neoliberalism that legacy has
substantially remained and though
Chile's economy is kind of functioning
that's extraordinary inequality a huge
poverty in the midst of plenty of
affluence the effects of the Pinochet to
a pension school proposal on a extremely
harsh and the populations uprising
overthrow them can I interrupt you to
get squeeze in one more question I
wanted you to say something about how
you see the climate emergency in
particular in in Latin America and
looking at the both scenario from
attitudes to business and the absolute
crisis it's brought about in the Amazon
could you say something about that
there was a recent article in one of the
leading us journals by looking of
economic scientists by one of the lead
authors of the IPCC report Iran pure
humbler which opens by saying let's not
mince words it's time to panic now and
he's right we have a very short period
in which it's possible still to prevent
an overwhelming environmental
catastrophe which will in fact that
terminate organized human life in any
form that is recognizable now in the
midst in the midst of at the point of
this crisis the most powerful country in
world history the United States is
racing to try to exacerbate the crisis
to drive us off the edge they know
exactly what they're doing but
short-term profit is so significant that
it doesn't matter if we destroyed the
possibility of life for our
grandchildren it's really capitalism
going insane it's happening the same
things happening with the energy
corporations with the big banks and so
on now Brazil under Bowl Sonora happens
to have joined the United States and
climate in the global warming denial and
moving to exacerbate the crisis or the
rate of fires in the Amazon if not
sponsored at least tolerated by the
government is increasing rapidly it's
there simply are no words to describe
the fact then in the kind of situation
we're in we have leadership groups in
most powerful state in the in the world
the most powerful country in Latin
America racing to the cliff as fast as
they can go and the background is just
if take a look at the background is just
shocking they know exactly what they're
doing
it takes the Republican Party in the
United States is the most dangerous
organization in the world right now for
this specific reason alone
up until that's a decade ago as they
were trying to deal this beginning to
deal with global warming issues John
McCain ran for president in 2008 he says
mild global warming policies what
happened is that the one of the major
ended private energy corporations Koch
brothers started a poured in began a
massive campaign of into buying senators
intimidating them developing huge
lobbying campaign massive juggernaut to
fake popular movements to knock on doors
as I succumbed the parties switched
positions now global warming is in his
four-letter words you can't mention it
that's led to a situation in which we
made literally destroy ourselves unless
sharp changes are taking place and
what's happening in Brazil is a shocking
example of this the role of the United
States is if we're honest the worst
crime in history even Hitler didn't aim
at destroy all of human civilization
Trump is doing that and his party's
behind him and this very little
discussion of reminding us of how
important it is to see these crimes and
the wonderful way you lay it all out I
wish you were here we all wish you're
here today but thank you anyway very
very much for your time and you're a
wonderful inspiration and lucidity all
the very best to you provide thank you
very much
