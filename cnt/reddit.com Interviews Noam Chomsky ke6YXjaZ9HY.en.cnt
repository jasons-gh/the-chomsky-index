first question here is from cocoon 56 do
you currently see an elephant in the
room of cognitive science just like you
named 150 years ago I guess that's a
reference to my critique of radical
behaviorism something that needs
addressing but gets too little attention
well one thing that I think gets too
little attention in the room of
cognitive sciences cognitive science
most of the work that's done just
doesn't seem to me to bear on cognitive
science I could pick up a couple
journals here and give an example give
examples the cognitive science ought to
be concerned is or is should be just a
part of biology if you're it's it's
concerned with the nature the growth the
development maybe ultimately the
evolution of a particular subsystem of
the organism namely the cognitive system
which should be treated like the immune
system or the digestive system the
visual system and so on
when we study those systems there are a
number of questions we ask one question
is of course you know what they are can
we characterize them that's almost
totally missing in cognitive science I
mean take my own particular area of
interest language it ton at work in
what's called cognitive science on what
they called language but it's very rare
to see some effort to characterize what
it is well if you can't do that doesn't
make much difference what else you do
the second kind of question you have to
ask about any organ if you like so lose
the term loosely subsystem of the body
is how it gets the way it is so
how does it go from some initial state
which is genetically determined to
whatever state it assumes and in
investigating that topic there are a
number of different factors that you can
take apart for analytic purposes one is
the specific genetic Constitution that's
related specifically to this system that
doesn't mean that every piece of it is
used only for this system but just
whatever combination of genetically
determined properties happens to be to
determine that you have a mammalian
rather than an insect visual system for
example or gut-brain
or whatever it may be that's one the
second is whatever data are outside that
modify the initial state to yield some
attained state and the third is what are
the how do laws of nature enter into the
growth and development of the system
which of course they do overwhelmingly
well in nobody for example assumes that
you have a particular genetic program to
determine that cells split into spheres
not cubes let's say let's do the
minimization of energy other laws of
nature and the same holds throughout the
course of development of course the same
is true for evolution evolution takes
place within a actually the specific
physical chemical channel of options and
possibilities and the physical laws
interval of time into determining what
goes on and third question is that it's
kind of like a why question why is the
system this way not some other way well
there again you you go back into at this
point you really are facing first of all
just dissed Oracle accidents like you
know asteroid hit the earth but more
significantly how do the physical and
chemical properties of the universe
enter into determining that certain
evolutionary changes take place under
particular circumstances well that's the
array of questions that ought to be
asked but it's very hard to find any
focus on these questions at least in the
areas of cognitive science that I'm
particularly interested in like language
for example what you have is extreme
efforts which are sometimes extremely
strange to try to show that trivial
problems for which we basically know the
answers and have for 60 years can be
somehow dealt with by a massive data
analysis so you know I could give
examples but and I think I've written
about examples but I think it's kind of
off track I'd like to see cognitive
science focus on the topics that it
ought to be addressing now this is a
very broad brush so a lot of it does and
there's very good work in cognitive
science but it's my opinion too much too
restricted and a lot of time and effort
is spent and my view largely wasted on
the peripheral issues which you just
don't make any sense which you look at
them in efforts which just collapse it
constantly in fact many of them are a
kind of a residue of the radical
behaviorism that the field sought to
overcome as it developed could give
examples but it's my a very general
broad brush feeling unfair to a lot of
very good work but right
pick out tendencies which I think are
off-track missing things second comes
from the silent number what are some of
your criticisms of today's anarchist
movement how to be as effective as
possible with something many anarchists
overlook and you're perhaps the most
prolific voice on this topic so your
thoughts would be very influential well
don't agree with the last comment but my
criticisms of today's anarchist movement
are a little bit like the critique of
cognitive science what is today's
anarchist movement I mean there's quite
a lot of people in fact you know an
impressive number of people who think of
themselves as being committed in some
fashion to what they call anarchism but
is there an anarchist movement I mean
can one think of you know is there
something like say during the day out of
it
twenty years ago I happen to be in
Madrid and happening Mayday
there were a huge demonstration made a
demonstration of hundreds of thousands
of people from the CNT the old anarchist
labor organization well you can have all
kind of criticisms of the anarchist
movements in Spain and so on but at
least there was something to point to
there was something there there was
something to criticize or to support or
to try to change or whatever but today's
anarchism in the United States as far as
I can see is extremely scattered a
highly sectarian so each particular
group is spending great deal of its time
attacking some other tendency sometimes
doing useful and important things but
it's extremely hard to I think what is
this is not just true of people people
who think of themselves as anarchists
but of the entire activist left it count
noses there's plenty of people
more than there were any time in the
past that I can think of except for
maybe you know tiny pooch very brief
moment in the late 60s or CIO organizing
in 30s and things like that but there
are people interested in all sorts of
things you may walk down the main
corridor at this university you see
desks students very active or engaged
lots of great issues but highly
fragmented there's very little
coordination there's tremendous
sectarianism and intolerance mutual
intolerance insistence on my particular
choice as to what priorities ought to be
and so on so I think the main criticism
of the anarchist movement is that it
just ought to get its act together and
become accept divisions and controversy
you know we we don't have the answers to
what all the earth we have maybe
guidelines as to what kind of society we
would like not specific answers nobody
knows that much and there's certainly a
plenty of range of room for quite
healthy and constructive disagreement on
choice of tactics and priorities and
options but I just see too little of
that being handled in a comradely
civilized fashion with a sense of
solidarity and common purpose as to how
to be as effective as possible yeah
that's exactly the point
what should we address don't have to
give a list of severe problems that the
world faces a seminar extremely severe
so for example there are really
questions of species survival literally
at least two maybe more one of them is
the existence of nuclear weapon
somebody watching from Mars would think
it's a miracle that we've survived for
the last 60 years and it's extremely
dangerous right now
I can't see you that can feel to be a
priority and the others are looming
environmental crisis and that is
something that anarchists in particular
should be very dedicated to addressing
because it involves on the one hand it
does involve questions of technology
like yeah can you get solar power to
work and so on and and the anti science
tendency and anarchism which does exist
is completely self-defeating on this
score nama days going to take is going
to require sophisticated technology and
scientific discoveries to create the
possibility for humans society to
survive I mean unless we decide well it
just shouldn't survive we should get
down to you know a hundred thousand
hunter-gatherers or something okay
except for that if you want to if you're
serious about you know the billions of
people in the world who their children
and grandchildren it's going to require
scientific and technological advances
but it's also going to require radical
social change I mean there's been a
particularly in the United States but
it's true elsewhere too there have been
a massive the state corporate social
engineering projects very self-conscious
don't hide what they're doing since the
second world war to try to construct a
social system that is based critically
on wasteful exploitation of fossil fuels
that's what it means to suburban eyes to
to build highways and destroy railroads
and so on through the whole gamut of
planning that's been undertaken well you
know that means very substantial social
change is in order and anarchists ought
to be thinking about it now thinking
about it doesn't just mean I'd like to
have a free and just society
no that's not thinking about it we have
to make a distinction if we want to be
effective that's the question
if we want to be effective we have to
make a distinction between what you
might call proposals sorry
proposals and advocacy I mean you could
propose that everybody ought to live in
peace love each other we shouldn't have
any hierarchy everyone should cooperate
and so on okay it's a nice proposal okay
for an academic seminar somewhere
advocacy requires more than just
proposal it means setting up your goals
proposal but also sketching out a path
from here to there
that's advocacy and the path from here
to there almost invariably requires
small steps
it requires recognition of social and
economic reality as it exists and ideas
about how to
build the institutions of the future
within the existing society to quote
Bakunin but also to modify the existing
society that means steps have to be
taken that accommodate reality that
don't deny its existence and say I don't
like it I'm not going to accommodate it
that's these are the only ways to be
effective you can see that if you look
at you know the the serious substantial
anarchist journals it takes a freedom in
England which maybe is the oldest or one
of the oldest anarchist journals that's
been around you know forever if you read
its pages most of it is concerned with
mild reformist tactics that's not a
criticism it should be it should be
concerned with workers rights with the
specific environmental issues with
problems of poverty and suffering with
imperialism and so on yeah that's you
should be concerned with if you want to
advocate a long term significant social
change towards a more free and just
society and I can't think of any other
way to be effective otherwise you the
the insistence on purity of proposal
simply isolates you from effectiveness
and activism and even from reaching for
even approaching your own goals and it
does lead to the kind of sectarianism
and narrowness and lack of solidarity
and common purpose that I think is has
always been a kind of pathology of
marginal forces the left in particular
but is particularly dangerous here which
gets to the next step sentence from
berserk RL is a long question but just
summarize it suppose we favor a
stateless society in the long run it
would be a mistake to work for the
elimination I've said that it would be a
mistake to a limit to work for the
elimination of the state in the short
run and we should be trying to
strengthen the state
because it's needed on the check of
power of large corporations yet the
tendency of a lot of anarchist
research my own to is others is to show
that the power of large corporations
derives from state privilege and
governments tend to get captured by
concentrated private interests that
would seem to imply that the likely
beneficiary of a more powerful state is
going to be the same corporate elite
we're trying to oppose so if business
both derives from the state and is so
good at capturing the state why is it
abolishing the state a better strategy
for defeating business power than
enhancing the state's power would be
well it's very simple answer to that
it's not a strategy and since it's not a
strategy at all it can't be a better
strategy the strategy of eliminating the
state is back in the level of let's have
peace and justice how do you proceed to
eliminate the state ok can you think of
a way of doing it I mean if there were a
way of doing it in the existing world
everything would collapse and be
destroyed you just can't do it and
there's nothing to replace it if there
was a rich powerful network of you know
cooperatives community organizations
worker control of industry you know
extending over the whole country and the
whole world in fact yeah then you could
talk about eliminating the state but to
talk about eliminating the state in the
world as it exists is simply to keep
yourself in some remote academic seminar
or a small group you know saying gee
this would be nice it's not a strategy
so it can't be a better strategy we are
faced with realities what is described
here and in fact it's true I've written
about plenty about it too is that we
have a number of systems of power
closely interlinked one of them's
corporate power business power that's by
far the most dangerous of all that means
effectively unaccountable private
tyrannies a second pretty closely linked
to the mistake power and the combat is
correct as the combat potater says I've
written about it too a lot that state
power tends to be overwhelmingly
influenced by concentrated private power
okay there's a real problems now we face
strategies so for example let's say take
takes a health care okay right on the
front pages what's the strategy for
dealing with the fact that at tens of
millions of people it can't get the best
health care they can get is to be
dragged to an emergency room when it's
too late to do anything I mean that's a
real problem and that's a huge part of
the population second problem is that in
a privatized unregulated health care
system like the United States and I
should say like because it's the only
one in a privatized unregulated health
care system where the drug companies are
so powerful that the government isn't
even allowed to negotiate drug prices in
that kind of system first of all health
care is strictly rationed by wealth very
strictly and secondly it is designed in
such a way that the federal budget is
going to be destroyed
you just take a look at the tendency
lines there won't be anything left for
schools for Social Security for
worker safety anything will be left this
is for the military
that's untouchable keeps going up
another problem we ought to look at
Obama has the biggest military budget
since the Second World War so but as
long as that is over there
untouchable another elephant in the
closet the radically inefficient
privatized unregulated health care
system is extremely harmful for people
except for the wealthy they do fine and
is also going to destroy everything else
so what do we do about it well it's not
a strategy to say okay let's abolish the
state that doesn't do anything about it
in fact it's just a gift to the
corporate state power sector because it
offers nothing a short term answer is to
do what the midget large majority the
population has wanted for decades namely
to develop a sensible national health
care system of the kind they were every
other industrial country has one variety
or another has to be a larger majority
opinion and so you don't break down many
walls to organize people about it and
has been for decades it's strongly
opposed by the corporate state axis but
that's not unbreakable you know bigger
victories have been won we could go into
details you know like what do you do
about the fact that the Democrats who
sold out for obvious reasons on even
minor palliatives like a public option
and so on what do you do about the fact
that concrete fact it was just an
election in Massachusetts which
surprised everyone totally almost
completely misrepresented but when did
that but one of the striking things
about the election was that the union
members Obama's natural constituency
the Muslim didn't bother voting because
there's tremendous apathy and they were
working-class areas the election was won
by the wealthy suburbs but of those who
voted most of them voted for Scott Brown
the Republican against the Democrats
shooting themselves in the foot
incidentally is one of the first things
that happened is to knock off one
possibly pro-union member from the
National Labor Relations Board but had
reasons the reasons are very clear just
read the labor press the reasons are
that Obama made it very explicit that he
was willing to compromise or give up on
everything except one thing taxing union
members for their health care plans so
sure people are enraged about that why
shouldn't maybe it's not a harvest
position it's just a simple elementary
human position well okay if you're
interested in the long-term project of
the question are namely dissolving state
and corporate power
maybe you should be paying attention to
that you should be organizing workers on
that you shouldn't leave it there rush
limbaugh to organize people with real
legitimate grievances that's the way to
fascism you should be out there
organizing them themselves on their
concerns you know their concerns can be
related to and easily related to much
longer term anarchist style projects but
that's where anarchists should be
working and the same is true and every
other has part of the society I mean
some of the things that are going on an
hour can have surreal but would offer
real opportunities to for anarchist
organizing so let me take another one
the tendency in the economy for the last
30 years by state corporate planning
don't happen from out of the blue has
been to towards financial izing the
economy and the corollary that is
undermining domestic production ok the
two go together so for example the share
of financial institutions in GDP gross
domestic product was maybe 3% back in
1970 now it's approaching a third and
concomitant Lee a productive industry is
being dismantled I which is fine for the
owners great with them if they can
produce and you know Mexico or China or
something but is terrible for
communities and workers at the same time
it's finally being recognized even by
the corporate a-league which has been
fighting bitterly against it for years
that there's a real environmental crisis
coming and they're going to lose what
they own so they want to do something
about it and so what they're now kind of
timidly saying as well we should not be
the only country in the world and the
advent industrial world that doesn't
have high-speed rail we should have
high-speed rail minimal but significant
move towards dealing with severe
potential crisis well right at this
moment the government and the
corporations are dismantling a
productive industry in say Michigan and
Indiana like closing GM plants and so on
and sending the production abroad or
they're doing that that's one thing to
doing the other thing that's happening
is that Obama's Transportation Secretary
is in Europe in Spain using federal
stimulus money namely taxpayer money to
try to get contracts for a Spanish firms
to provide high-speed rail that the
United States needs can you think of a
better thing
I mean it's hard to think of a more
dramatic criticism of the state
corporate socioeconomic system here are
communities and work forces being
destroyed while we while their tax money
goes to purchase in Spain what they
could be producing themselves now if you
can't realize about that you're really
in trouble you're not a movement at all
of course should the I'm gonna take city
of the workers and Gary Indiana or Flint
Michigan and so on
do they have to just sit and watch this
happen no they can take over the work
the workplaces the factories they can
run on themselves they can convert them
that's been done before there's much
greater conversion during the Second
World War to work on production
they'll need state support for that
because that's the only institution that
exists and the only one that people can
influence can't influence a private
tyranny
it can't influence the government has
often been done it would take some
support but nowhere near as much as
bailing out goldman sachs and so on it
would take some it would take a lot of
popular support but it can be done it
can even be done within the framework of
conservative economic theory which is
pretty straight about this you read
textbooks on corporations that say well
you know it's not graven in stone that
they should work only for the benefit of
shareholders which means a tiny
percentage of wealthy shareholders they
can work in the interests of
stakeholders meaning workforce and
community and I decide to do that but
the workforce in the community can
decide it for those are perfectly
feasible efforts in fact it's been done
you know there are cases where it's been
done this case it was even been tried on
a very large scale like US Steel and
came close to succeeding and could with
more corporate
port well you know these are good go on
with this but these are real organizing
strategies which combine short-term
efforts which confront real problems
that people face in their everyday lives
with long-term objectives like creating
part of the basis for a society based on
free association solid I already popular
control and so on
and it's sitting right there in front of
our eyes
those are my view are the things we
should be looking at not abstract
questions like should we try to destroy
the state for which we have no strategy
my feeling is that's the direction in
which kind of direction of which
thinking ought to move it doesn't mean
giving up your long term goals in fact
that's the way to realize them and if
there's another way to realize them like
I've never heard of it I guess the
question that comes to mind just grows
out of these comments is there's a very
large number of people who are committed
sincerely and rightly to the kind of
long-term objectives that anarchists
have always tried to uphold and the
question is why can't we get together
and decide on and instead of you know
condemning one another for not viewing
things exactly the way we do why can't
we try to formulate concrete proposals
which combine two properties one dealing
with the real problems that people face
in their immediate daily lives he's
going to get anywhere you've gotta have
to deal with those that's not just for
tactical reasons it's also out of simple
humanity
so on the one hand those while
maintaining as your guidelines the
conception of the kind of just and free
society that you would like to bring
into being through these steps and
sometimes the two are very close
together as in the case that I mentioned
like takeover of a productive Enterprise
by workforce and communities which is
not it's not it's a feasible objective
and one that has a great deal of Appeal
would have if it were put forward as to
others and combined so both the long
term vision and the short term dealing
with real existing grievances and
problems and there are quite a few
things like that so the question is why
not focus on that rather than on
abstract questions such as what's the
best strategy for destroying the state
answered well no best strategy because
nobody's proposed any
