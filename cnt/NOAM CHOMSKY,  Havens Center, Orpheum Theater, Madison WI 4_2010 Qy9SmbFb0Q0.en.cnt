tonight we celebrate an honor Noam
Chomsky's lifetime contribution to
critical scholarship both for his
importance to our collective pass and as
a role model for being an engaged
activist intellectual for our collective
the future well I don't have to waste
time saying what's obvious how pleased
then grateful I am for this honor which
also offers an occasion to look back
over the years when I do so what comes
to mind with particular sentence for me
are the earliest years and put in part
because I've been thinking about them
lately for other reasons reasons that
are somewhat unpleasant I'm just old
enough to have memories of Hitler's
speeches on the radio 75 years ago I
didn't understand the words but I
couldn't fail to grasp the Menace of the
tone and the cheering mobs the first
political article I wrote was shortly
after in February 1939 was right after
the fall of Barcelona I'm sure it was
nothing particularly memorable it was
fourth grade newspaper of which I was
saying
I was the editor and probably the only
reader
maybe my mother I'm not sure but I could
call a little of it much more clearly
than the few words i remember are the is
the mood of fear and foreboding it
opened with the words Austria Falls
checks Lakia Falls and now Barcelona
Falls this was immediately after the
fall of Barcelona and Spain with a few
months later the words have somehow
always stayed in my mind along with the
the mood the dread the sense of the dark
clouds of fascism gathering over Germany
than Europe and no one could see how far
beyond as a growing force of
unimaginable horror no one could foresee
the Holocaust but just a few weeks
earlier Chris Chris Donna had taken
place and the desperate flight of
refugees had been building up over
several years many of them unable to
believe what was happening in those days
the same childhood years i also had my
first experience with critical
intellectuals what are often called
radical intellectuals though they
wouldn't be called intellectuals by the
way the term is standardly used that
standardly used to apply to people with
status and privilege who are in a
position to reach the public with the
thoughts about human affairs and
concerns and since privilege plainly
confers opportunity and opportunity
confers responsibilities the question
always arises
to how they're using that responsibility
actually the article that Eric just
quoted was based on an article by Dwight
MacDonald mid-1940s on responsibilities
of intellectuals which was about the
same topic and those are very live
questions in those years Russell dewey
eric from mcdonald or will and others
work that I soon became familiar with
when I was a little older but the
radical intellectuals of my child the
first ones I met were different they
were my working-class relatives in New
York was the depressions of mostly
unemployed one uncle who was disabled
was able to get a newsstand thanks to
New Deal measures which helped disabled
people and since he had employment he
was able to support a good deal of
family my these relatives most of them
had very limited formal education uncle
who I mentioned was it was an enormous
influence in my life he never went past
fourth grade but it was one of the most
lively intellectual circles I've ever
had anything to do with on the periphery
is a child of course there were constant
discussions about the latest concert of
the Budapest string quartet of the
controversies between steckel and Freud
of every imaginable branch of the
radical politics and also about activism
and the activism in those days was
reaching pretty impressive Heights
particularly significant by the mid 30s
were the sit-down strikes that's just
one step short of workers taking over
factories eliminating management and
ownership and radically changing the
society these are ideas that ought to be
very much alive today and if
they're not that's the fault of today's
critical intellectuals among others well
the rising labour activism aroused
enormous concern in the business world
leading figures on quoting warned about
what they called the hazard facing
industrialists in the rising political
power of the masses and the need to
intensify the everlasting battle for the
minds of men on and on like that they at
once by the late 30s were instituting
fairly sophisticated programs developed
even more so later to overcome this
threat to order discipline was put aside
during war but taken up afterwards with
extreme dedication and scale it's quite
good scholarship on this it's worth
bearing in mind that the United States
is unusual among industrial societies
that has an extremely class conscious
business community it's constantly
relentlessly fighting a bitter class war
by 1941 I was spending the large part of
my time in downtown Manhattan
gravitating to another group of radical
intellectuals these were in small
bookstores on Fourth Avenue for those of
you who know New York down below
fourteenth Street below union square
either there or in the anarchist offices
in Union Square which was nearby the
bookstores were mostly refugees many of
them anarchist refugees from the 1936
revolution they too didn't fit the
standard formula for intellectuals but
if by intellectuals we mean people who
think seriously about about society
about human affairs about the problems
of life with a background of knowledge
and understanding and this consider
carefully the problems and
possible solutions then by that standard
they were indeed intellectuals and they
were quite happy to spend time with a
young kid who was fascinated with the
1936 anarchist revolution at the time I
was able to pick up a lot of material
which was quite interesting i used a lot
of it later on 30 years later than i was
writing about the spanish revolution
well almost among those memorable of
these materials is a collection of
primary documents put together by
peasant societies that were carrying out
a collective spontaneous their own
collectivization efforts it was
published in 1937 by the cnts the
anarcho-syndicalist union that's happens
to be celebrating its centenary this
year one particular contribution has
resonated in my mind quite often it's by
peasants of the village of mem bria
quote parts of it in the miserable huts
of mem bria live the poor inhabitants of
a poor province 8000 people the streets
are not paved the town has no newspaper
no cinema neither a cafe or a library
food clothing and tools were distributed
equitably to the whole population money
was abolished work collectivized all
goods passed to the community
consumption was socialized it was
however a socialization of not of wealth
but of poverty the whole population
lived as a large family functionaries
delegates the secretary the Syndicates
the members of the municipal council
were all elected and they acted as heads
of family but they were controlled
because special privilege or corruption
would
be tolerated membri ax is perhaps the
poorest diligence main but it's the most
just these words capture with rare
eloquent the achievements and the
promise of the anarchist revolution
promise which is yet to be fulfilled the
achievements didn't just come from
nowhere they were the outcome of many
decades of struggle of experiment brutal
repression as I mentioned the CNT which
is behind a lot of it is celebrating its
antenna centenary centenary and that
also meant learning so knowing how to go
on this experiment of creating a world
of freedom and justice was crushed all
too soon by the combined forces of
fascism stalinism and liberal democracy
the global power centres understood very
well that they must unite to destroy
this dangerous threat to subordination
and discipline before they turn to the
secondary task of dividing up the store
it spoils among themselves that's what
we call the Spanish Civil War but the
basic the revolution was over before the
Spanish Civil War really took off
crushed well in later years I've
sometimes been able to see the first
hand the at least a little of the lives
of poor people like those of Umbria for
people suffering often suffering brutal
repression and violence in the miserable
slums of Haiti at the peak of the terror
in the early 90s supported by Washington
though the facts are still suppressed
and highly relevant to today's tragedy
in LA in Haiti or in refugee camps in
Laos where tens of thousands of people
were huddled they were driven from their
home
recently been driven from their homes by
a CAA mercenary army that swept through
northern Laos this is after years of
trying to survive and caves under a
relentless bombing that point the
heaviest bombing in history which had
nothing to do with the Vietnam War
incidentally it's one of the gravest
atrocities of modern history I think
it's still largely unknown and still
killing many people because the land is
saturated with unexploded ordnance or in
Palestine or southeastern Turkey of many
other places among these particularly
important to me for personal reasons is
southern Colombia where right now
campesinos digitus people Africa
Colombians are being driven from their
devastated lands by terror and for many
sources and by chemical warfare by us
here it's called fumigation as if we
somehow have the right to destroy other
countries on pretext that we manufacture
these are people capable of the most
miraculous is sympathy and humanity and
despite the awful suffering in which we
play a major part while usually looking
the other way though in this case at
least not in Madison thanks to the work
of the Columbia support group here
one of the things I learned in the
anarchist book stores and offices 70
years ago whether I had been wrong in
taking the fall of Barcelona in 1939 to
be the death knell for freedom and Spain
it was actually two years earlier in May
1937 when the industrial working class
was crushed by communist-led repression
and communist army is swept through the
countryside destroying the collective's
with the assistance of the liberal
democracies and with Hitler and
Mussolini waiting in the wings well a
few years after that I went off to
graduate studies at Harvard first time
away from home there I found had my
first extensive experience with what's
called the intellectual world the elite
intellectual world shortly after arrival
i went to the standard faculty run party
for incoming graduate students and i was
regale a very distinguished philosopher
mention his name with an account of the
depression which he assured me had not
taken place it was a liberal fabrication
so there were no rag pickers coming to
our door in the early 1930s try to get
some pennies to survive and there were
no women being beaten by security forces
on strike outside a textile plant one
jet passed by when I was maybe five
years old on a trolley cart with my
mother and there were none of my
unemployed working-class relatives a few
businessmen might have suffered but
beyond that nothing happened it's
perfectly obvious from Harvard Square
story well unfortunately that's not an
exception such attitudes or broader I
could mention other cases some of them
pretty ugly but most of the people were
Stephenson liberals Liberal Democrats
these are the people who applauded when
Adlai Stevenson said at the United
Nations that we have to defend Vietnam
from what he called internal aggression
new concept that was invented we have to
defend them from the assault from within
that's what President Kennedy called it
and these are words that we here again
today for example last Sunday in the new
york times where we read the following
front-page story after the conquest of
Marja in Helmand province the Marines
have collided with the Taliban identity
so dominant that the movement appears
more akin to the only political
organization in a one-party town with an
influence that touches everywhere we've
got to read that reevaluate our
definition of the word enemy said the
commander of the Marine Expeditionary
Brigade in Helmand province most people
here identify themselves as Taliban we
have to readjust their thinking so we're
not trying to chase the Taliban out of
Marja we're trying to chase the enemy
out subtle distinction since the Taliban
are the enemy that's that's familiar
problem it's a problem that's bedeviled
the conquerors from way back is very
familiar to the United States from
Vietnam for example back in the mid-60s
the leading US government scholar ended
up being headed into China archives at
Berkeley he wrote a widely praised book
in which he lamented that the enemy
within was in his words the only truly
mass based political party in south
vietnam and any effort of ours to
compete with it politically
would be like a competition between a
minnow and a whale so we can't do that
we've got to find a way to overcome
their political force by using our
comparative advantage which is violence
as we did successfully others have faced
similar problems for example the
Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s
that was an invasion which elicited here
the kind of outrage that we muster for
the crimes of enemies Middle East
specialists would impulse who was there
reminds us that the Russians that his
words won many military victories and
through their sieve and action suit
civic action programs they actually won
over many of the villages and in fact as
we know from reliable sources they
created a substantial freedom in Kabul
particularly for women but to go on with
Pope over the decade of their
involvement the Russians won almost
every battle and occupied at one time or
another virtually every inch of the
country but they lost the war when they
gave up and left the Afghans resumed
their traditional way of life it's not
exactly accurate he's overlooking the
fact that when the Russians left the
radical Islamist forces that the United
States had organized with help of Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan ravaged the place so
they were so devastating the population
welcomed the Taliban when they came in
and many of them are now what we call
the governor Lord government of Kabul
the dilemmas that are faced by Obama and
the crystal aren't quite the same as
those faced by the Russians the enemy
who the Marines are trying to chase out
of their own villages have virtually no
outside support the Russian invaders in
short contrast we're facing a resistance
that received vital support from the
United States from Saudi Arabian from
Pakistan they were busy rounding up the
most extreme radical and fundamentalists
they could find anywhere arming them
with advanced weapons while carrying
forward the program of radical Islam
ization of Pakistan it's one another one
of Reagan's gifts to the world along
with the Pakistani nuclear weapons the
goal of these US operations was not to
defend Afghanistan that might have been
acceptable policy but that was not the
goal the goal was explained most clearly
by the person to charge the CIA station
chief in Islamabad he was running the
operations he said the goal is to kill
Soviet soldiers he boasted that he loved
this noble goal that making it very
clear in his words that the mission was
not to liberate Afghanistan which was he
didn't care about many of you are should
be familiar with the beginning of regime
skis somewhat similar boasts by the
early 1960s I was pretty deeply engaged
naddy war activities details are
informative that tell us a lot about the
intellectual cultural climate and places
like say liberal Boston where I was I'll
skip that but by 1966 my personal
involvement was deep enough so that my
wife went back to college after 17 years
to get a degree at three kids to take
care of and it looked as if it might be
facing a long prison sentence which
actually came very close the trial was
announced but shortly after that it was
canceled because of that offenses it's a
very significant event which convinced
the business community
in the United States the ones who
fundamentally make the decisions that
the war was becoming too costly in na
that the major warnings have been
achieved that's another long story i
won't go into well after policy shifted
after the Tet Offensive in policy
quickly shifted it suddenly turned out
that everyone in Cambridge had been a
longtime opponent of the war didn't deep
deep silence i should say the kennedy
memoirists hope our people who wrote
memoirs of camelot the early sixties
they all rewrote them they rewrote the
memoirs radically revising they were
untroubled and commentators were
untroubled by the radical revisions or
by the extensive documentation that the
new tale that they were telling was
completely false the tale the new tale
was that Kennedy had been a dove and was
trying to end the war so on
assassination prevented this noble
effort that evidence is just
overwhelming the documentary public and
private evidence that he was kind of the
hawkish end of his administration he
knew that the war was very unpopular so
figured there get out of it threesome
but he insisted to the very end a couple
days before the assassination that we
can't consider withdrawal before victory
is assured but even before the Tet
Offensive say 1966-67 there were growing
doubts in these circles not doubts about
right and wrong those are questions that
don't arise when we're engaged in some
activity somewhere but rather about the
question that does arise namely the
likelihood of success may be a paradigm
example was a widely read book by story
and Arthur Schlesinger one of Kennedy's
advisors he it was beginning to be
concerned by the 1966 so
that victory might not be so easily at
hand here's the way he put it she said
we all pray that the Hawks will be right
and that surge of the day will bring
victory and if it does we will be
praising the wisdom and statesmanship of
the US government and gaining gaining
military victory and then he went on to
describe accurately what the victory
would look like military victory while
leaving the tragic country gutted and
devastated by bombs burned by napalm
turned into a wasteland by chemical
defoliation a land of ruin and wreck
with its political and institutional
fabric pulverized so if that succeeds
we'll all be praising the wisdom and
statesmanship for the American
government remember this is a liberal
government we're talking about the
liberal intellectuals but he thought
probably the escalation wouldn't succeed
and would prove to be too costly for
ourselves so perhaps strategy should be
rethought and after the Tet Offensive it
was really thought under essentially
under instruction by the business world
well not that much has changed today
when say Obama is hailed as a leading
principle opponent of the Iraq invasion
because he said that it was a strategic
blunder those aren't new ideas you could
read that he could have read that in
Pravda in the early 1980s there were
plenty of people in the Communist Party
writing openly saying it's a strategic
blunder to invade Afghanistan we're not
going to gain anything it's my cost is
too much we don't call that principled
in that case but we call it principled
in our case which is just an indication
of how deeply rooted the Imperial
mentality is extirpating it is no easy
task well it's hard to say but
unfortunately it's not false that within
the dominant spectrum attitudes like
these
you might call liberal imperialism
they're the good guys there's a likely
alternative it's revealed by some of the
most recent polls some of the last few
days about half of voters say that the
average tea party member is closer to
their views than President Obama fewer
select Obama on virtually all issues the
Republicans are according to the polls
are trusted by the electorate more than
Democrats in many cases by double digits
other evidence suggests that these polls
are not recording trust their recording
distrust the level of anger and fear in
the country is like nothing I could
recall in my lifetime by comparison the
1930s where the Depression was much
deeper we're sort of a period of hope
you know somehow it's going to get
better we can do something about it not
not now and since the Democrats are in
power and those are the attitudes the
revulsion over the current social and
economic political world attaches to
that and unfortunately these attitudes
though they in some respects surprising
given their scale and depth they're not
there are understandable for over 30
years real incomes for the majority of
the population have stagnated or
declined social indicators basic
measures of the health of a society they
have steadily deteriorated since the
mid-1970s before that they grew closely
tracking growth as you'd expect but
they've been declining their last
figures or from a couple of years ago
it's back to nineteen sixty what people
but these are in large part the
consequences of very conscious decisions
in the 1970s to radically modify the
nature of the economy
financial izing the economy and that has
a corollary corollary is the hollowing
out of domestic production it still goes
on but not here you like the same
managers and owners and produce in
Mexico or China or somewhere else and
that means no jobs well what people see
before their eyes and what's clearly
fueling the anger and hatred is that the
bankers who are primarily responsible
for the current crisis and who were then
saved from bankruptcy by the public
there now reveling in record profits and
the huge bonuses while official
unemployment which is way below actual
unemployment is a at about ten percent
in manufacturing industry it is actually
a depression levels one at one and six
and the good jobs are not likely to
return for the reasons I mentioned well
people you know they want some answers
why is this happening to us we're not
living in third world's not the stone
age it's not third world conditions but
why is this happening at a rich society
they see plenty of wealth going into the
very few pockets probably record levels
of inequality they want to know why this
is happening and they are hearing
answers from only one place talk radio
fox news Sarah Palin they're giving them
answers and the answers actually have
some internal coherence and I said a lot
of time listening to talk radio log
driving and it's interesting shouldn't
be laughed at the people involved maybe
complete sentence but the people call in
art they're sincere they have grievances
they want answers that getting answers
and the answers are internally coherent
if you're willing to sort of suspend
disbelief and forget what you know about
the world
it's not a joke and enter into you know
kind of a world of irrationality to see
it does hang together it's an answer I
think ridiculing tea party shenanigans
is a serious error it should be far more
important i think it is far more
important to understand what lies behind
this and to ask ourselves a question why
are these justly angry people being
mobilized by the extreme right and not
by forces that did so quite successfully
in during my childhood in the days of
the formation of cio and other
constructive activism well just take one
illustration of the recent illustration
of the operation of jermichael really
existing market democracy which does not
much do with markets or democracy obama
his primary constituency is financial
institutions they have gained such
dominance in the economy that the share
of corporate profits has risen since the
1970s from a few percent to about a
third which is tremendous economic power
they preferred Obama to McCain and they
largely bought the election for their
funding that carried it at the end and
they expected to be rewarded that's why
you put your man in office and they were
but a few months ago responding to the
very visible rising anger Obama began to
criticize what he called the greedy
bankers so on who had been rescued by
the public and he even proposed some
measures to constrain some of the things
they do and punishment for this
deviation was very Swift the major banks
announced at once very prominently front
page stories in The New York Times if
this they were going to shift their
funding to Republicans if Obama
persisted with this offensive rhetoric
well he heard the message within a few
days
he informed the business press that
bankers are as he put it fine guys he
singled out for special praise the
chairs of the two leading beneficiaries
of public largesse JPMorgan Chase and
Goldman Sachs his friends great guys and
he assured the business world that I
like most of the American people don't
begrudge people a successor wealth it's
referring to the bonuses and the profits
that are infuriating the public they
went on and say this is part of the free
market system and not inaccurate the way
free market is interpreted in state
capitalist doctrine well people see that
not very happy about it none of this
ought to be surprising there was an
encouraging radical who talked about it
a couple of centuries ago this name was
Adam Smith heard he observed that the in
1776 that the principle is talking about
England of course he said the principal
architects of power of policy in England
are the owners of the society in his day
they were merchants and manufacturers
today that multinationals and financial
institutions and the principal
architects of policy makes sure that
policy will attend scrupulously to their
interests however Grievous the impact on
the people of England and even more so
on the victims of what he called the
savage and justice of the Europeans
abroad he was speaking of primarily of
British crimes in India that was a
primary concern of an old-fashioned
conservative with moral values might
take Diogenes to find them today
but he's basically right that ought to
be a truism it's one of the few
principles of political science that's
overwhelmingly supported obvious and
denied of course like anything simple
and revealing there's a great deal of
fevered discussion these days about
whether or when the United States is
going to lose its dominant position in
global affairs to China and India the
rising world powers and there's a
particle of truth to these laments but
not much a part that's partly based on
serious misconceptions about the debt
and deficits and crucially the actual
state of India and China which is
nothing like the image that's presented
but also much more seriously into that
the discussions are based on a very
serious misconception of the nature of
power and its exercise fact several
misconceptions one of them is Adam
Smith's truism but there's another one
which dominates scholarship and
discussion on international affairs in
the these areas it's common to identify
the actors in international affairs as
states which pursue something called the
national interest that some mystical
notion that's uniform for the CEO of
General Electric and janitor claims the
floors and this national interest is
totally divorced from the internal
structure of power quite distinct from
adam smith will smith actually had a
sharper eye and his radical truism
provides a useful corrective to all of
this discussion so barring it in mind we
can see that there is indeed a global
shift of power though it's not the one
that's occupy
center stage it's a further shift for a
substantial further shift from the
global workforce the transnational
capital has been sharply escalating
during the last couple of decades
so-called neoliberal period the period
here of financialization and the
industrialization and the cost is pretty
substantial it includes working people
in the United States and those suffering
much more severely like for example
starving peasants in India where peasant
suicides are rising at about the same
level as the number of billionaires and
millions of for testing part with tens
of millions of protesting workers in
China where the labor share of national
income is declining even more rapidly
than it is in most of the world China is
indeed playing a leading role in these
global changes it's become pretty
largely an assembly plant for a regional
production system so Japan and Taiwan
and other advanced Asian countries /
export the parts and components to China
they provide most of the sophisticated
technology and Chinese labor assembles
it and exports it it was give one
example there was a recent study of this
by the sloan Foundation which took as
one of their examples an iPod that costs
160 dollars and they estimated that four
percent at four dollars that's like two
percent of the value added it was padded
in China it's counted as Chinese exports
but they're not doing much except
putting it together there's a lot of
concern read all over the place about
the US trade deficit with China which is
growing enormously but there's less
emphasis in fact lean on except in the
business press
about the fact that the trade deficit
with Japan and Taiwan is sharply
decreasing well that's part of the same
regional production system and US
manufacturers are right in the middle
there following same course providing
parts and components and technology for
China for them to assemble an export
mostly back to the US well for the what
Smith called the principal architects of
policy for the financial institutions
the retail giant's walmart and so on the
ownership and management of
manufacturing industries and the various
sectors closely related to this nexus of
power oh this is just heavenly but not
for American workers but as Smith
pointed out their fate is not the
concern of the principal architects of
policy well returning to the charges
against the greedy bankers we should
recognize in fairness that they have a
they have a valid defense they have a
task their task is to maximize profit
and market share in fact that's their
legal obligation if they don't do it
they'll be replaced by somebody who will
so that's an institutional fact not
because they're bad guys and the also an
institutional fact is the inherent
market inefficiency that you learn about
in your first term of economics an
inefficiency that requires them to
ignore what's called systemic risk that
is the likelihood that the transactions
that they enter into will harm the
economy and the population generally you
don't take that into account when you
make a market transaction so they know
full well say the defined guy is in
Goldman Sachs they know perfectly well
the transactions they enter into are
likely to tank the economy will take a
genius to figure that out it but these
externalities as they're called are not
their business
and they cannot be again not because
they're bad people but for institutional
reasons it's also unfair to accuse them
of irrational exuberance with Alan
Greenspan's phrase and his brief
recognition of reality during the
artificial tech boom of the 1990s late
90s actually there are zoo birds and
their risk-taking are quite rational in
the knowledge that when the inevitable
collapse comes they can flee to the
shelter of the nanny state clutching
their volumes of Hayek and Friedman and
brand and so on and OB paid off the
government insurance policy which is
always there in the background that's
what that's why they put these guys in
office that's one of the many perverse
incentives that magnify what are
inherent market inefficiencies it could
be overcome by regulation but that would
have to be carried out by officials
reflecting acting for a different
constituency than not the constituency
that actually puts them into office well
after the latest disaster occurred last
couple of years there was a discussion
and you know leading economist about
what was called an emerging consensus
that we must pay attention to the
stability of the financial system as a
whole and not just its individual parts
i happen to be quoting barry eichengreen
one of the most respected analysts and
historians of the financial system two
prominent international economists said
that there's a growing recognition that
our financial system is running a
doomsday cycle whenever it fails we rely
on fiscal policies to bail it out this
response teaches the financial sector to
take large Gamble's to get paid handsome
and don't worry about the costs they'll
be paid by taxpayers the ones who are
now flocking to the Tea Party movement
will be done through bailouts and a
variety of other devices and the
financial system is therefore
resurrected to gamble again and to fail
again the system is a what's called a
Doom loop by the official of the Bank of
England who's responsible for financial
stability it's understood and it was
understood years ago in fact late 90s
there was a book by two leading
international economist called the
global finance of risk which discussed
exactly this the fact that the market
inefficiencies of systemic risk RR Doom
loop especially when magnified by the
policies carried out by the architects
of policy who are oh they're positioned
to the people who own the society so the
regulation the extent exists is very
thin well financial crises are bad
enough a lot of people are suffering
from them but they're much worse things
and the same logic applies a year ago
the about a year ago the business world
was pretty impressed by the success of
the insurance companies and Big Pharma
in destroying the possibility of any
meaningful health reform and sharp
defiance of the public will that's
pretty serious matter I mean not only
for the people who suffer from the
dysfunctional health care system but
even on narrow economic grounds we're
instructed constantly they were supposed
to deplore the deficit well question
about whether we should but if we do we
should notice that about half the
deficit is attributable to unprecedented
military expenditures they're going up
under Obama and most of the rest of the
deficit is attributable to the
increasing costs of the virtually
unregulated privatized a health care
system just being preserved that's
unique in the
industrial world it's also unique in the
gifts that are given to drug companies
promised again by Obama that's over the
opposition of aamir eighty-five percent
of the population in this case last
August Business Week had a cover story
celebrating the victory of the health
insurance industries of course no
victories ever enough so they persisted
in the struggle gaining more again
against the will of the large majority
that's another interesting story i'll
have to put aside well observing this
victory the American Petroleum Institute
impacted by the Chamber of Commerce and
the other great business lobbies
announced very publicly again read at
New York Times other they're going to
use the model of the health industry
campaigns the successful campaigns to
destroy health reform they were going to
use that model to intensify their
already quite substantial propaganda
efforts to convince the public to
dismiss concerns about anthropogenic
global warming now than they did and
that's been done with great success
those who believe in this liberal hoax
have been reduced to barely a third of
the population the executives who are
dedicated to this task and know as well
as the rest of us that the liberal hoax
is quite real and the prospects are
pretty grim but they are fulfilling
their institutional role the fate of the
species is an externality that they
ignore and they must ignore to the
extent that market systems prevail so
one part of their lives they may care
that the lives of the grandchildren and
everything I own is going down to two
but in the other part of their lives
they have to make sure that that happens
and that's what we're seeing in front of
us right now well go on too long but one
of the one of the most moving and
clearest articulations of the public
moved at least that I've seen was
written by Joseph Andrews stack you may
remember that a couple of months ago he
crashed his small plane into the office
to an office building in austin texas
commit suicide he left a manifesto
explaining his actions it was mentioned
in the press mostly ridiculed but I
think it deserves much closer attention
stacks manifesto describes it traces the
life history that led into this final
desperate act story begins when he was a
teenage student living on a pittance of
Harrisburg Pennsylvania former
industrial area right near its heart
just at the heart of the industrial
center he had neighbors she was a woman
in her 80s she was surviving on cat food
quoted now she was the widowed wife of a
retired steel worker her husband had
worked all his life in the steel mills
of central Pennsylvania with promises
from big business and the Union that for
his 30 years of service he would have a
pension and medical care to look forward
to in his retirement instead he was one
of the thousands who got nothing because
the mill management and the Union not to
mention the government raided their
pension funds and stole their retirement
all that this widow good wife had was
social security to live on he could have
gone on to say that there are now
concerted and persistent efforts by the
super-rich and their political allies to
take even that away on spurious grounds
and that may happen in the next few
years well going back to stack he
decided he couldn't trust big business
and he would strike out on his own and
he soon discovered that he couldn't
trust a government that as he put it
cared nothing about people like him but
only the rich and privileged or a legal
system in which there are two
interpretation
for every law the one for the very rich
and one for the rest of us he couldn't
trust the government that leaves us with
the joke we call the american medical
system including the drug and insurance
companies that are murder in tens of
thousands of people a year with care
rationed largely by wealth not by need
all of this is a social order in which a
handful of thugs and plunderers can
commit unthinkable atrocities and when
it's time for their gravy train to crash
under the weight of their gluttony the
force of the full federal government has
no difficulty coming to their aid within
hours and the federal government of
course means the taxpayer a stack says
that his desperate final act was an
effort to show that there are people
that willing to die for their freedom in
the hope of awakening others from their
torpor it wouldn't surprise me that he
didn't say so if he had in mind the
premature death of the steel worker that
taught him about the real world when he
was a teenager now that steel worker
didn't literally commit suicide as far
as we know but he was he died after how
quickly after having been discarded to
the trash heap and that's very far from
an isolated case it's a it's a we can
add his and many similar deaths to the
colossal toll of the institutional
crimes of state capitalism there are
poignant studies of the indignation and
the rage of those who have been cast
aside as the state corporate programs of
financialization in the
industrialization have closed plants
destroyed families and communities and
said like rather similar studies of
similar reactions in Chinese areas
sometimes called their right the rest
built where similar things are happening
these reveal the sense of acute betrayal
on the part of working people who
believed
that they had fulfilled their duty that
to society in a kind of a moral compact
with business and government only to
discover that they were just instruments
of power and profit cast aside when they
were no longer useful these are truisms
from which they had been carefully
protected by the doctrinal institutions
returning reading Joe stacks manifesto
of all other stuff like it I do find
myself recovering childhood memories and
a lot more that I didn't understand at
that time the bimah Republic Germany was
20s and early 30s that was the peak of
Western civilization it's worth
remembering that in science is the arts
and literature it was also regarded as a
model of democracy through the 1920s the
traditional ruling parties the liberal
and conservative parties they entered
into decline inexorable decline and
suddenly it was well before the process
was intensified by the Great Depression
in 1925 general Hindenburg pressure
aristocrat was elected president and the
coalition's elected him was pretty
similar to the mass base that swept and
hit her into office eight years later
that compelled the aristocratic
Hindenburg to select as Chancellor we
call the little corporal who he despised
but he had to do it because of the masks
court as late as 1928 the Nazis had less
than three percent of the vote two years
after that the most respectable Berlin
press was lamenting the site i'll quote
them of the many millions of this highly
civilized country who had given their
vote to the communists ha lowest and
crude crudest charlatanism the public
was becoming disgusted with the
incessant wrangling
of them are politics democratic
parliamentary politics and the service
of the traditional parties to powerful
interests and their failure to deal with
popular grievances and at the same time
they were being drawn by persuasive
forces that were dedicated to upholding
the greatness of the nation and
defending it against invented threats in
a revitalized armed unified state which
was marching on to a glorious future led
by the charismatic figure who was
carrying out what he called the will of
eternal Providence the creator of the
universe he berated to the mesmerised
masses with his speeches I was hearing
and not understanding but sort of
grasping in some sense back in the mid
30s by may 1933 the Nazis had largely
destroyed not only the traditional
ruling parties but also the huge
working-class parties and they were
enormous and also their associations
which are very powerful and rich they
were gone within a few years the Nazis
were declared Mayday 1933 to be a
worker's holiday first time that was
what the big les parties had never been
able to achieve and many were good
people took part in the enormous
patriotic demonstrations on May Day 1933
more than a million people estimated in
the heart of what was called Red Berlin
work left-wing working-class city they
joined farmers artisans shopkeepers
petty bourgeois paramilitary forces
Christian organizations athletic clubs
military clubs and the whole rest of the
coalition that was coalescing as the
center very quickly collapsed by the
onset of the war probably ninety percent
of Germans were marching
enthusiastically
the Brownshirts well the world's too
complex for history to repeat but there
are some unpleasant memories
reverberating and there are lessons to
keep in mind we'll have to expand on
them there's for those who want to
choose the vocation of critical
intellectuals there's no shortage of
tasks that's true whatever they're
stationed in like life whether they're
called intellectuals or not they can
sweep away and try to sweep away the
mists of carefully contrived illusion
and reveal the stark reality which is
often quite simple when you clear away
the mist they can become engaged
directly in popular struggles they can
help organize the countless Joe stacks
who are destroying themselves and maybe
the world and they could join them in
leading the way to a better future
