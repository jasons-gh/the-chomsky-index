right I think the implications are
dangerous but and it's easy to ridicule
them you know look at the crazy things
they say you want to kill my grandmother
and so on and there's a lot of nonsense
that's true
but what we really ought to be asking
ourselves is why the peace movement the
left the activist organizations aren't
organizing these people a lot of what
they're protesting is it's pretty
sensible I mean a lot of the protests
for example or against the bailout the
massive bailout you know they feel that
they were betrayed they they pressured
worked very hard to prevent it and two
minutes later they got it on why should
the you know bankers end up from the
recession more powerful than they were
before which is what's happening you can
read it in the business breasts they're
exalting about it the more powerful and
they were before they're the big banks
are even bigger than they were the
government insurance policy the
too-big-to-fail insurance policy is
guaranteeing them that they can continue
doing exactly what they were doing which
tanked the economy they can take risky
make risky loans and investments since
it's risky they'll make a lot of profit
money coming out of the rears if it
collapses the taxpayer will come in and
bail amount was it too big to fail
bonuses and profits are going through
the roof and meanwhile people are
suffering well they have a reason to
protest that and but but the tragedy is
that the protests are and many other
things the protests are being organized
by pretty much the same sectors that are
creating the crisis the corporate money
that's behind them is the ones who are
very happy that it's coming out like
this now and the the as a real failure
of the activist movements the left the
peace movement and so on that we're not
organizing
I think that's the question we ought to
ask and there are other things I mean
there are historical memories that are
awakened you know want to draw analogies
too closely but there's some
similarities which are not encouraging
certainly for someone my age these
people have real grievances I mean I
have not seen a demographic analysis of
you know those who call in on talk shows
but I listen to them a lot and they're
interesting I mean if you sort of
suspend disbelief you forget about
reality of the world and just listen
it's not a joke if you listen the
message that comes across this has an
internal logic to it it's coherent it
gives answers to people who want answers
and need them and deserve them they're
crazy answers but they're not hearing
any others I mean these are people
who've you know worked hard they're done
everything right you know Christian
god-fearing take care of their families
and and for for 30 years they've been
shafted I mean the people who for the
last thirty years have seen their wages
income stagnate or decline benefits
decline services decline there is
nothing for the children you know worlds
out of control these are the people who
on Pohl's maybe 80% of them say the
country's going in the wrong direction
the government's run by the few and the
special interests not the people and so
on you know they're not wrong this is
all happening to them and the answers
that they're getting from say you know
rush limbaugh Michael Savage the rest of
them are well we have an answer the rich
liberals own everything they own the
corporation's
they run the government
they run the media and they don't care
about people like you they don't care
about the flyover people between the
East Coast and the west coast they only
care about giving everything you work
for a way to you know to illegal
immigrants or gays or something so we
got to protect ourselves from them and
furthermore they run the government when
they put up a health program it's not to
give you health it's to kill your granny
no and that's an answer to something
it's a terrible answer but it is an
answer and if you do suspend disbelief
you forget about what's happening in the
world really
it's a coherent answer now they're not
hearing anything else and the memory
that comes to my mind again I don't
press the analogy too hard but I think
it's worth thinking about is late by our
German II there were people with real
grievances the Nazis gave them an answer
it's the fault of the Jews and the
Bolsheviks and we got to protect
ourselves from them and that'll take
care of your grievances and we know what
happened that Germany in the 1920s was
the most civil law the peak of Western
civilization and in the arts and the
sciences highly Democratic functioning
democratic institutions a decade later
it was in the pits of human history but
again the analogy is not it's not closed
but it's frightening and unless an
answer can be given to these people
unless they can be led to understand
what's really happening through them we
could be in for trouble
