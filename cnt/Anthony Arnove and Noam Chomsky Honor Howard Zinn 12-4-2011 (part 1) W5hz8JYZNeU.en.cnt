knowledge the generous support of being
james shipper of our College of Liberal
Arts and Sciences and the multiple co
sponsors and volunteers with work very
hard these past couple of weeks to make
this event possible
welcome those who are watching the live
stream of today's event today we
celebrate the legacy and life's work of
historian activism and playwright Howard
Zinn historian who made history
history of the United States the powers
in give us a radically new way to tell
and to interpret American history
reacting against conventional historical
narratives which has always given the
impression of a gloriously and
coherently unfolding series of triumph
and progress Zen privilege the
perspectives of people at societies
margins to use his characteristically
provocative words slaughtered and the
mutilated Sammy's retelling took aim at
the heroes of high school his history
textbooks finally forcing us to confront
the genocide of Christopher Columbus and
the deep racial failings of Abraham
Lincoln since vision had mass appeal for
the American public and he played a
pivotal role in our nation's most
important grassroots struggles for
social justice since the 1960's most
notably around the Vietnam War and the
civil rights movement few are better
qualified to reflect on Howard Zinn's
relevance to social justice in today's
world than our two distinguished guests
both were close personal friends Howard
Zinn professor Noam Chomsky is an author
philosopher and activist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
his institute professor emeritus in the
Department of linguistics and philosophy
beyond his revolutionary war
in linguistics professor chocolate is
internationally recognized as a vocal
critic of u.s. foreign policy the needle
double turn of global capitalism and
mainstream corporate media we are also
joined by Anthony are no writer editor
and filmmaker Anthony are not

Zinn including writing and producing the
people speak the documentary film based
on zinn's a people's history and
screened on this campus just a few days
ago Arnold has also collaborated with
professor Chomsky editing in the 2008
volume the essential Chomsky our plan
for today is as follows during our first
hour our speakers will each give
presentations during the second hour
they will respond to questions posted on
this events facebook page and submitted
by you by the art of the audience today
so we'll have questions from Facebook
and questions so that if I you the
audience today if you haven't seen them

being passed around if you are inspired
write down question at the end of the
presentations will collect them all and
cover as many of them as we can we ask
that you be concise respectful and
legible those of you in the overflow
areas I understand there are several
overflow areas can also submit questions
don't be shy so without further ado
please welcome our first speaker Anthony
are no
thank you so much for that introduction
and for all of you for coming out to
honor Howard it's so beautiful to see
the outpouring of interest excitement
and enthusiasm around Howard's work not
just here today New Paltz but really an
occupied canvas and struggles and
activities around the country so moving
to hear that at Boston occupied people
were calling the library their powers in
Memorial Library
and of course it's bittersweet to be in
this moment of such exciting and
possibility and turn and struggle people
coming into motion of people protesting
people organizing because Howard was so
loved to have been among the people
taking part in all of these
demonstrations and activities it would
have been so inspired by the creates
duty by the dynamism of energy and it's
it's really bittersweet and think about
the fact that he can't be here but he is
yet the same time so present so present
in the way in which people have honored
him like they've done occupy Boston
present to his ideas sewing he was
libraries around the country's report
that their best borrowed or most often
stolen actually title history of the
United States you see people with
slogans on their on their banners
they're handwritten slogans quoting
power taking quotes on his books taking
quotes as well from our film people ski
and there's nothing automatic about that
there have been moments in history when
people have gone into activity have gone
into struggle and have it necessarily
have the same reverence for or
understanding of the work of those who
came before them and the same kind of
respect and having drawn aside the same
kind of inspiration so to see Howard
inspiring people see Howard find new
audiences today is really remarkable I
mean it's phenomenal the power had
we had with engine light even more
phenomenal to see the impact you
continue to have a new generations of
people so I wanted to share a few
stories of the very lucky period I had
collaborated with powder just few that
illustrate some of his remarkable
character as a person and and really
what made in such an inspiring example
today the first story I want to tell
comes from my first conversation with
power of course I knew Howard's work I
had read a few sister United States and
lectures and read other of his books and
had in fact in some cases traveled hours
to hear him speak at campuses like this
but we've never met and then one day I
was working at a small antenna
publishing house involves chemical south
end press have him pick up a phone and
Howard's very distinctive voice who's on
the other end of the line and this was
you know a little bit unexpected of
course I recognize Howard's voice but I
wasn't expecting him to be calling south
and press that day and the reason for
his call was that someone who gave
correspondent with in prison and visited
in prison for more than a decade was
being released and how it was calling
around to find work for this friend of
his we hadn't visited and supported
through all those years to car serration
and that's exactly the kind of radical
power plus you always put into practice
his ideas his ideals he was always very
concrete and come
it to the people who he saw himself in
solidarity with struggling alongside
earth a few years later I had the
privilege work with Howard book of
interviews called terrorism and war and
they are interviews dealt largely with
the US efforts at that point abroad in
Afghanistan particularly in Iraq the
beginning of those occupations that
Howard's clear principles early
opposition to those occupations and
during that time Howard called me and he
was very excited because the night
before he had been invited by any better
Pearl Jam to come on stage and concert
at the Boston they changed the name is
some Emir of shirk and reminded the name
of the big fleet center exactly and
maybe better had invited him Howard on
stage Abby having been so inspired by
Howard's work wanting to give powered
platform and introduce our too many fans
to come up here pearl jam that night but
also wanting to give Howard platform
powered said to me the next morning I
gave the best speech of my life it was
only three words long and the Lord and
that really was so poignant because
Howard never made anything
it was simple he spoke with such
concision such clarity and and and I
think that's part of why he was able to
reach so many distinct audiences with a
very radical understanding of history of
our role making history so it's partly
through that influence to his connection
to people like any better GRU of course
is connection with Matt Damon put the
grill decline in Good Will Hunting in
which Matt Damon's character and robbery
and character talk about two votes of
people's history the United States and
also manufacturing consent that very
point bone in that film and then of
course there are other moments in
popular culture the simpsons included in
toronto system united states later on
sopranos who have an episode it opens
with a shot of equals history united
states have a whole episode constructed
around the conflict around columbus but
partly through that ways and with that
language howard's ideas and popular
culture that this interesting milestone
happened when i was working the powered
on on that book character Morgan
beginning to work on another book that
came to be known as voices of the
people's history of the united states
and the milestone was that a people's
history so that's one coming copy which
is remarkable at the time
2002 the time it's now so more than two
months profits and you know this is a
vote that was published in nineteen
eighty not for a moment of love for
change in our culture contracted a very
inhospitable moment it was published in
a first edition of 5,000 copies and so
22 now infiltrated so many different
aspects of our culture and to have so
many teachers surreptitiously
introducing it into their classrooms
even though of course we know are
increasingly being required to teach to
test and having less and less control of
the recruiting yet they're finding these
creative ways introduce howard text to
their students and to bring it into the
classroom even when it's not officially
sanctioned to do so it achieved this
first milestone of a million copies and
harper collins who is powered oh sure
that Logan as you might know a corporate
commercial publisher called how are they
said we were very excited this milestone
is happening we want to do something to
commemorate that you've reached a
million copies and what we've come up
with this idea we'll have a conference
of historians it will sit around and
discuss the impact of your work and
maybe we'll have people read passages
united states and howard said very
quickly I'd rather drink poison
and he said either far better idea
people who read my book say to me over
and over again it was so inspiring about
my own words and of course is he would
joke as wonderfully written as my own
words are but the words of the people
they encounter from history of the
sentient protests in the United States
Eugene dad standing with hammer
Frederick Douglass all of the people who
are excluded from our traditional
education at our traditional textbooks
Hindu whose voice comes from so
eloquently in the people's history of
the united states i know that was
certainly my experience along about
going public school in Indiana know
nothing about Eugene Debs the great
socialist and labor organizer agitator
one of most eloquent important
organizers in our country's history and
he has lived in indiana growth I've
grown up there ran for president united
states five times in state of india not
once and my school public pool textbook
if i come across the name of using test
it was only when I came to people's
history of the united states so how I
understood that and he said we should
get people together and how people read
the words form the words even themselves
that was partly also Howard's
understanding of the importance of part
imports of the collective experience of
coming together creative expression and
so we organized in 2003 our very first
performance with kurt vonnegut reading
eugene tabs with Alice Walker with Patti
Smith the morning people have power and
it was a tremendous experience and it
really confirmed Howard sense of how
important it was to give voice to these
people in our past who struggled for
whatever freedoms do the sheep in this
country and a couple years after that we
were doing some of these
around the country and we were to
auditorium in los angeles beautiful
auditorium the Japanese American
cultural and community center in a great
reading that night and a very funny
thing happened that I think there's a
little bit of insight of the Howards
personality oui oui narrated these
evenings of performances voice ecosystem
United States however instead it went
into the stage I was sitting together
and then we just do a little bit of a
context a paragraph or two about each of
the performer performances that the
audience was going here and the sound
engineers at the auditorium didn't
realize that something was going on the
Kandarian Harriman we listened to the
audio recording of the event afterwards
which is that they were leading Howard's
microphone on during the readings
Lawrence's which was very sweeping in
the at the end of the day because you
could just hear how is joy and glee and
in visceral reaction to everyone the
performances that night even though he
was so familiar with those voices he had
heard them before get read them get
written about them but there was
something so original so fresh is his
groans of glee as people were performing
these these pieces was just remarkable
and then of course later on we learned
to begin to tell the engineers
at a time to make sure how it was like
when he wasn't when he was introducing
people and you know the process of
working on those those live performances
the voices that people sister United
States led us to the process of working
on still the people speak which I was so
privileged to work with Howard on and we
we started the filming of the people
speaking Boston at the coupler majestic
theatre of emerson college of course of
two days and i just want to share two
stories from that first was a very funny
moment we had a break in between a
morning taping session and afternoon
taking session of these live
performances that we were filming for
the documentary and howard was a great
fan go components famously addicted to
their coffee and donuts and so Howard
wouldn't steal away the dunkin donuts
coffee of course we had coffee backstage
you know because just going to regroup
if you want to go out to dunkin donuts
and you know we're going to film set so
there's pas and there's cameras and
sound people and he's miked and but ok
we're going to go to dunkin donuts
Antonio Morrison who's in the film
outside ski what's it
power so we go to the Dunkin Donuts
around the corner it's a small shop and
we walked into the shop and that segment
is a kind of a nervous flurry of
activity and his woman gets out her
camera phone and she wants to have a
photo taken but she doesn't have her
photo taken with viggo mortensen she
said to me go excuse me sir that was a
world as it should be where's Cory you
are we admire and of course you go share
that sentiment completely and later that
that weekend we had a press conference
in Vigo horn says there is going to run
past a howard said something that I'll
never forget who is talking about the
experience of working on his project and
he said I haven't had a feeling like
this since I was part of the support I
feeling of solidarity the feeling of
being part of something the feeling of
being part of something far more
meaningful than your own individual
career satisfaction and to have been
part of giving Howard a bit of that
sense is so exciting important all of us
because really Howard conveyed as no
other person I know the joy of being
activists and there's no better life no
more fulfilling life everyone lived in
struggle power wrote a piece that
was about Eugene Debs and after Howard
died we had a memorial in Los Angeles
for some of the people who have been
involved and they will speak and
invoices of people's history gathered
for a kind of a private performance
where that night instead of reading from
dads and and true stand and all the
people whose words had been part of the
performances we had done a voice we had
a program but only readings and Howard's
speeches and letters and his in his
folks it was very moving evening people
were brought to tears many times but
really the most memorable moment of that
evening came for me when David Stremme
fair read from howard zinn talking about
Eugene Debs and I just want to quote
something that that David read that
night these are how it works we are
always in need of radicals who are also
lovable and what he said about Dead's is
that we need to learn from him quote a
determination to hold up for a troubled
public those ideas that are both old and
inviting the more bold the more inviting
I think really that just says all about
Howard old inviting clearest ideas that
he held up and the attraction that those
held for so many people and I my hand
really just with another thing that
Howard wrote that i came across
the Otago compost for America it's a
actually a text book that he wrote her
small publisher when I was fellowship
with publisher it's not well known today
in Indiana indianapolis-based publisher
and at the end of that book he was
writing about social movements of the
1960's and 1970's any of this to say he
said in post-war America it was
beginning to be recognized by a small
the growing part of the population that
the special qualities of control
possessed by the modern liberal system
demanded a long revolutionary process
struggle and example the process would
have been long enough intense enough to
change the thinking of people and I
think that idea of struggled an example
really sums up how much or what Howard's
life was about his commitment to
struggle the fact that he himself was an
example to us of a life lived in
struggle and he goes on to say that his
hope is that the three associations of
people engaged over a long period of
difficult struggles with entrenched
power democracy would come into its own
at last and I think really in this
moment of occupy that vision is
something is so vital and so urgent that
we fight forfeit
okay I mean like this asked earlier they
can strong yourself on these if you
haven't already and now it is a great
pleasure to invite to the podium
professor Noam Chomsky from MIT
one of my favorite evening to that power
same platform I could remember but one
of the greatest ones with in April 1975
the info panel about board become
breathless University and that's Howard
was talking I did ran down the aisle and
said the word open power when he came up
from Boston to be thrown out of the
college where he was teaching in Atlanta
because he had supported the black
students who were sitting on campus
civil rights would have been too much
for the administration Boston made in
Korea later he must couldn't give a
class boston university without hundreds
of hundreds of students are enough but
the administration they are love them so
much that they finally threatened that
unless he was kicked out of his
department the department did not hit
you in a paper foot so finding an hour
provide greater thing well whatever i
think about the power because quite
often particularly last few months
realities reasons there are words that
is the old resume my mind there is cole
focus our attention on its words the
countless small actions of unknown
people that are the foundation for those
great moments that ultimately energy is
borrow record without countless actions
alumni
bullet created that's a fundamental
truth of history and one that his work
and in fact his life as well did a great
deal to illuminate rings of
understanding it's no exaggeration to
say that he literally changed the
consciousness and also the conscience of
the entire generation so small
achievement continues and expands well
this particular event could not have
been better time it's course taking
place in the midst of the accomplice
small actions of unknown people who are
rising remarkable Occupy movements
there by now several thousand of the
United States and Richmond results were
these are the first real reaction first
real challenge to the diversity what has
been a severe assault on the general
population of the united states and the
best generation counterparts throughout
the world are reacting to quite similar
results major exercise of bitter class
board that's been worldwide centered the
United States straight punch of the
world and the similarities are real so
just take what's maybe one of the most
dramatic the most dramatic upper squares
that's not the body's parts course but
nobody uprisings share containing said

the same route in Egypt Mubarak dictator

what sometimes called again IMF World

they had Sam devastating effects that
they had differently they created great

much of the population inequality sort
there was a massive corruption that
increasingly brutal repression of the

quite familiar huge hard to remember it
today but Alan Greenspan head of the Fed

Prince Ben and proudly explain to
Congress thanks to growing worker

surprisingly right now they're all
facing regression keep world what
parking footage it's so different kinds
in two places but the general tendencies
are strikingly similar just as the
global assault on the past generation
has been so disastrous well for Howard
and I'm sure that the rising up of
countless unknown people and their mess
actions all of this loop in the
fulfillment the dream of a lifetime of
passionate commitment
devotion and another vindication of
lessons that need work very hard to make
part to us about how we can address
towards a more civilized world there are
regular howard zinn Memorial events the
Occupy movements are vibrators lecture
series privileged in the first one of
those occupy Boston food but they're all
over the place I was very good read
there is nobody so much to inspire these
movements it's a tragedy for all of us
but ours not hear it even bigger than we
did for so many years and said help
direct and I constructed path that's not
gonna be easy to
and tremendous success but the tactics
are kind of half-life a while after a
while we can have measured in terms it's
necessary to think about how to modify
them keep the principles of mind not be
too little detectives go on to do others
angels I can clear what kind of things
have to be done now easily it's also
necessary through the obstacles that are
going to come up and power system the
power dump plays by carefully they had
many means pack themselves they're
playing experience about protecting so
unlike the popular movement which keep
coming up and then without hysterical
never for taking through in a highly
atomized society like ours where you
aren't there had been sustaining who
whatever you thought about the old
communist party one good thing they know
they weren't going to win quickly you
always going to be somebody around to
terminate a graph G next time the
demonstration story so we thought about
civil rights movement
sixties a bit of started the third way
back for the really big reason some
victories a lot of face which he batted
fruit in this mall managers in custom
things that how was doing support for
his participation after the first time
we spend any long period of time the
other was added civil rights
demonstration jack stands city back in
the early 60s remember how about posting
for what well mr. Howard did one of the
things he dedicated a lot of his wife
who was trying to overcome this lack of
historical memory and they love inroads
but if it's passed it really has to be
super suit passively with the
recognition that Victor exactly come
fast you make it smaller forms of power
systems a lot to accommodate not modify
but I didn't want to have forwarding
changes that have to be to respect a
substantial but hard dedicated
commitment over long stretch and as you
go he's was another striking comparison
between the Arab Spring and the
here and that's the aspiration that
inspires old for authentic functioning
democracy but there are difference in
Egypt say ever destroyed it and try to
gain elementary democratic rights which
had been blocked by the us-backed
dictatorship and still are in the United
States the effort is tried to try to
recover the rights that had been won
over centuries of struggle and have been
beaten back at least to do that I say at
least because the victories that had
been attained doesn't refer jerkin real
remember was partially recovered the
ground has been lost that's not using
himself I should be able too far beyond
that well we all know about the way
which democratic system has been
shredded during the
period when familiar fact is the
spectacular rise in the cost of
elections which all these consequences
especially to be about three billion
dollars for the next week in one place
to get three billion dollars and that's
what's gonna turn the party platforms
the exclusion of the US isn't Iran
candidates or that the clergy before you
vote for the death writing quote in the
United States their vetted by
concentrations of private cabin and then
you get a vote to difference increased
financial years Patrick apple from for
the economy blend 1970s erecting for the
2008 crash it was about forty percent of
corporate profits it's doubtful that it
does
harmful but it is remarkable yields
political power almost automatically so
that leaves the legislation that
accelerates issues I believe in living
well there's more to it than that
another aspect contrary will no studies
but without stand political economist
closer into powers Thomas Ferguson his
estate the way power initiated within
Congress usually the case that if you
wanted a position of influence and
conversation charity that was attained
by the seniority and service attention
but that was personal that's disappeared
it's now on supposed shown it's now
increasingly the results of pain money
into the party poppers well one way
wiseman many
pockets that candidates are reaching
into elected and that then a lot of that
kind of thing is La Crosse ones and one
consequence it's not just people
consequence of the fact that the couple
of decades ago the Republican Party
abandon any pretense of being a
conventional political party it sound
just a party of deep super reg accuser
is a contemporary or will isn't it
obvious it well fish was a job creator
that's presented to the population which
is sitting on mount attached so huge
they don't what to do dunno what not to
do is it three jobs
is a striking feature of the Republican
non-party is that has a definite party
loss which makes the old comics party of
flexible crazy among them don't say that
how to pour etre so on clothes every
their kind of fact I mean if a
organization of political electoral
organization is slowly after working for
the benefit of the super rich as get low
support and you can't get votes by
saying this is what we do so then this
messenger automatically filled the
tendencies in the population which
always been there
the last four decades they've been
increasingly mobilized weather just
fundamentalism of nativist tendencies
acres of fear these things get vocalize
that you have to appeal to get recovery
stage other things
recent history so ancient history that
are not very attractive both must
remember personally and that's serious
matter with children be overlooked one
definite conservative party line and
those who are super wealthy have to be
protected from the indignity of having
to pay a fraction of taxes not the dream
2008 taxes but they did great earth very
big part of the night in a while their
share of the fraction % unprecedented by
descent cars probably a sheriff
nationally known working people as we
reached unprecedented low so one you
still have a job well that's these are
things that are happening right before
our eyes the other the business business
party monopolizes elections of two
factions and the other faction who were
mostly would usually go
all this is the patient of the Interior
ation of functioning Democratic corners
for most socially but one index of
health democracy is functional
commodities house protection function
one day so that is the relationship
between public policy public weal
democracy we're in eighth grade the over
blue government policy and where those
gap and the character scandal that does
something that was happening in the
society owes a gap now sonic happening
which cast maybe this the different very
heavily hold a lot of people think and
the gap between what people want and
let's talk about what this time you can
see it from day to day there is a puppet
that there were long in Washington
that's the deficit focus on the best
public has opinions about that the
public doesn't regard to this is a big
problem they
our own job the right that may be a
problem potentially down the road not a
serious problem now my desert option but
for the bankers deficit problem that's
what he wrote about the Dozen well
that's that it is how you view the
public as a tenant overwhelmingly the
public thinks you should increase taxes
on the very bridge and should protect
that it was angry any impact financial
institutions of the ultra-rich think the
opposite us so therefore that's the way
it's gonna go down no taxes on variation
of enemy saying the weeks that came out
from the medicine commission they
indicate that the diet had been moving
privatizing Medicare not think that
that's supposed to cut the deficit
actually increases medical costs for
very simple reason in private sectors
former and for more explosive so if
people can shift from Medicare to the
private sector
factories in medical book form a
mechanical work so it doesn't
crease closes over so what the doing is
pursuing this is the liberal policies
would be one increase of both but
transfer them from taxpayers which at
least partially reaches the famous job
for either our shipment preventing the
over the same is true for that remark
strain proposals but it ran polls
probably knows back by just every
Republican was studied for the Boston
budget they estimated tens of trillions
of dollars to costs but transferred over
to camp a flirt there wouldn't be this
hamster was good Sam screw up raising
the eligibility at age 37 that doesn't
people like both of us we deliver but if
you're a blue-collar worker it cuts out
in piece of your life construction
worker fire needs me as partners it'll
work out your life is short those two
years or two years lest we can get in
there also it also raises health care
costs of courses and we need to approach
it from relatively efficient medicare
proposes a private insurance costs radar
screen security nothing to do it condoms
best part of the entitlements group is
so supporting its the deficit Japan it's
in pretty good shape its mission
rather than that forever but Social
Security has real problems not natural
bro the one problem is to sort of almost
no significance to people who are
available though that is the pension
because that work
Oh
collapse acepto people had their assets
in the house that's gone what happen
Americans for example will practically
down as your these people spies on
social security so one problem is those
on the works for the other problematic
is worth on the level it's the principle
of various based social security is
based on the principle of solidarity and
that's a very dangerous you might care
as we go the air about living is a
little bit overgrowth town as and could
proper to the Iran Alan Greenspan and so
on you know her pro she married the
wrong person our division terrible
sunburn else is an extremely dangerous
feature of the society which has to be
those how pure market caps and if people
have no sympathy for solidarity or
interference and system so you go to
come boy I didn't get very far back you
go back to the early days it was a very
flydubai repressive time much more than
ever since they would've labor present
everything like 40 people factory
factory farms Audrey artisans from Klaus
control and they will dinner be
condemned industrial system now they
took a grounded those who works in those
at home
the industrial system was taking away
their culture remembered my childhood
the one thing that they condemn harshly
was what they call the new spirit of the
aide the new spirit of the age in 1850s
game well for getting old so that regard
it as over again I stand over centuries
saying to have to try to drive those
like that heads and some steps tortured
but sort of securities understand what I
said Young Turk
so attack on public schools is
essentially the same words like why
should I favor schools but somehow force
those concepts in the aesthetics has
been a battle for 150 years prevent mold
undiscussed went back to the deficit
something that's completely disgusted
namely that was easy way out of this as
I character and it's not at all Toby
simply shift to a health care system at
the time that every other investors
popular idea Obama gave away the public
option would try that was over the
objections of a larger population when
he made arrangement incorporation to
persist in this kind of outlandish
concept to me to the united states that
the government's not allowed to
negotiate direct resented opposed but
these things you can't and in fact it is
true that if we have a belt system with
the cause of other industrial countries
which were better tiring but if we had
that would not a deficit but that's
undiscussed one it's not part of the
bait that infringes on the rights of
insurance companies
corporation so dimensions it which
rarely does it says lacks political
support where is politically possible or
something like that which is correct and
a system that's far from the only case
of the chasm between cotton but it's
worth and the office is currently
recognize that there are other ways to
undermine democratic institutions and
beyond suppressing their way is just a
control thing and that's often more
effective than great extremes out right
before our eyes it's a extraordinary
significance of the clusters nebulas
serious issue
history baskin with the species believed
in her life so I just review a couple of
events of the past can be weeks which
should have had screaming headline
the memory international convention on
climate change / has passed its task is
to try to carry forward the very limited
earlier decision partially leaded that's
the UN framework convention of 1992 of
the climate and the Coburn signing this
person commitment area is standing
there's a general mood leader of the
factory pretty effectively but New York
Times headline the Korean issues with
our expectations same kinds of durban
conference along with a international
poll invasion by the Holy Days visa for
some of the results published around the
world and even in the United States say
their government should give global
warming a higher priority as strongly
support multilateral action to address
it also the United States
less than Alfred us concern about the
threat has been declining over the last
few years so that American concern is
significantly lower than the global
average American quote Americans from
not perceived that there is a scientific
consensus on a need for urgent action on
climate change large or anything they're
not affected and that's contrary to do's
and most other countries learners tend
to underestimate the level of concern
among other Americans but none of this
is accidental that is directly related
to the decline of democracy resulting
from dedicated efforts controlling
manipulative opinion yeah with the
successes of the insurance insurance
industry in the apartment to underline
any kind of moderate health care reform
the other industries were inspired by a
fight over the energy intensive
he's announced over the spider that the
carrier to drug and campaigns business
lobbies with chambers arm it's going to
cast doubt on the ear in natomas
consensus scientists on the present
global warming new thread those is
probably near Jim Adams and because
there are two groups that don't agree
one of them is a very marginal group of
the climate change denial sciences so
there's a small group of diners that is
another very large of people who are
bring the consensus because the thing is
much too optimistic well there have a
discussion the standard media
presentation has
the other hand tremendous all of these
developments in the United States quite
a remarkable achievement both
advertising propaganda and a highly
controlled democracy kind of mistress
was at stake is whether a branch of the
world the living for work well where the
event is going to try to speed on
decision so the same poll said pubs
around world in recent years have
largely disapproved of how the United
States hand of the problem climate
change in general the United States has
been most widely seen as the country
having the most negative effect
Germany received the best grades one way
to gain some perspective what's going on
in the world is to imagine yourself in
the position
an intelligent extraterrestrial
observing watching him one as the
richest most powerful country in history
is surely leading the limbs are really
what's happening national agencies Henry
Kissinger's initiative try to comes out
with regular reports on carbon emissions
couple weeks ago channels laters report
said they rapidly increasing continues
on its present course by 2017 five years
the carbon budget will be exhausted part
of it is the quantity of emissions that
can keep global warming below 3
centigrade for us which is generally
considered a limit of so I they say
fighters with the IAEA chief economist
said door closing if we don't change
direction now how we use energy we will
end up beyond what scientists
callousness
for whiteley survival the door will be
closed forever bye to you holiday today
for that of the US Department of Energy
reported emissions figures for 2010 that
jumped by the biggest amount on record
of the level of greenhouse gases they
reported is now higher than the worst
case scenario that was anticipated by
the IPCC international federation
scientist but just said worse than worth
case scenario the NIDS major bourbon
fine obtained his Co director John
rightly pointed out that scientists had
generally found the IPCC predictions to
be too conservative in juvenile
detention and he pointed out that the
IPCC worst-case scenarios middle of the
estimates
keep running specials well just as these
predictions for being released in days
the London Financial time to go to the
homepage convert optimistic expectations
that the United States might become
energy independent for century with new
technology products have a radiant
Russian to become world news producer
that the hydrocarbon for oil natural gas
and this delightful event the US would
expect retain its global accounting for
a century there are probably marks that
are there about local local ecological
impact when a declining worse it was
nothing is said about what kind of a
world will emerge these exciting
prospect pretty important financial
times as you may have a comic world
business Billy was one of the most
sensible journals will return curious
Carol they had in the middle of all
these expectations certain over
contradiction well just been every go in
the world thinking of his Walkingstick
something to God and the u.s. going to
be leading the pack but factors cat is a
month ago and this along that critter
settling for one of the visit of his
coat that's one report of the game and
your moment is event house are now
dismantling the measures which was
introduced
control during dismantle another
indication of the very severe crisis of
American democracy suppress the whole
world gradually what was I mentioned the
gap between open opinion and public
policy in this cases is not as great as
a daughter that's serious issue
it was another fortunately it's not
everyone haven't seen a pole with
confident that if it was are some small
for you so the XL pipeline is they not
for wonderful reasons necessarily was
for the help of property ownership
backyard kristensen victory
palm faces anyway and one of the major
tasks to the occupied which is going to
be late to try to reach out in general
public for counter the word from habit
that is in this particular case that the
opposite of the scientific consensus for
example the particle times that
eventually a lot like pull that
generalized challenges ahead are very
series once again in the required solid
lasting organization but one of the
realities of the Occupy movements of
exciting achievements they have created
a lot of promise
physical very significant my society but
Erica's no tradition of working together
people with experience work sustaining
and if that can be carried forward and
translating something broader and put my
real historic significance once
countless small actions of people that
could great moments that will enter the
historical record
