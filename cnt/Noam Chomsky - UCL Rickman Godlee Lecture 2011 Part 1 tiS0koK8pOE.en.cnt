when we settled on the title for this
talk some
time ago a few would have guessed how
act it would be when the time came that
is how dramatically the world would be
changing and how far-reaching are the
implications and consequences for
domestic and world order the democracy
uprising in the Arab world has been a
spectacular display of courage
dedication and commitment to buy popular
forces it coincided fortuitously with a
remarkable uprising also unexpected of
tens of thousands of people and support
of working people and democracy in
Madison Wisconsin and other US cities in
fact one telling event occurred on
februari 20th when Kemal Abbas sent a
message from Tahrir Square in Cairo to
Wisconsin workers saying we stand with
you as you stood with us Abbas is a
leading figure and the has been and the
many years of struggle of Egyptian
workers for elementary rights what's
happened since January 21st did 5th did
not come out of nowhere in fact the
April sixth movement which organized it
the movement of young people tech savvy
young people that took its name April
sixth from a major strike action support
action in the big industrial center
textile industrial center of Egypt
mahalo center of the couple of years ago
that was crushed by force but it was
April sixth and that gives the name for
the movement that erupted unexpectedly
even the organizers on january 25th he
Abbas's message of solidarity evoked the
traditional aspiration of
of labor movements worldwide for a
solidarity among the workers of the
world and among populations generally
however flawed their record labor
movements have regularly been in the
forefront of popular struggles for both
basic rights including labor rights and
democracy generally in topper square and
the streets of Madison and many other
places the popular struggles underway
right now that reached quite directly to
the prospects for authentic democracy
that means socio-political systems in
which people are free and equal
participants in controlling the
institutions in which they live and work
and I stress participants and not mere
spectators that's the way democratic
theory has insisted is their function as
it's called the function of the public
the ignorant and meddlesome outsiders to
quote the walter Lippmann the most
prominent 20th century American public
intellectual Wilson Roosevelt
progressive is there in his highly
regarded progressive essays on democracy
and he was articulating a standard view
which actually traces back to the
founders of the US Constitution and is
upheld of course in much harsher forms
elsewhere right now the trajectories in
Cairo and Madison are intersecting in a
way but they're headed in opposite
directions in Cairo they're headed
towards eliminating towards gaining
basic rights that had been denied by the
western-backed dictatorships in Madison
they're heading towards trying to defend
rights that had been won in long and
hard struggles and are now under series
back there sure to be far ranging
consequences of what's taking place both
in the decaying industrial heartland of
the richest and most powerful country in
the world in human history in fact and
in what President Eisenhower called the
most strategically important area of the
world a stupendous source of strategic
power I probably the richest economic
prize in the world in the few in the
field of foreign investment those are
the words of the State Department in the
1940s that was a prize of course that
the u.s. intended to keep for itself and
for its allies in the unfolding a new
world order that was emerging from the
ruins of the Second World War the
different plenty of changes since but
the strike despite all these dramatic
changes there's every reason to suspect
suppose that today's policymakers
basically adopt the same perspective
they undoubtedly still adhere to the
judgment of one of the most more
influential advisers of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt a burly and his words that
control of the incomparable energy
reserves of the Middle East would yield
substantial control of the world and
correspondingly loss of control would
threaten the project of global dominance
that was clearly articulated during
World War two by high-level planners and
that has been sustained in the face of
major changes in World Order since that
day these common understanding is as is
quite often the case articulated most
frankly and clearly in the business
press in the u.s. in the wall street
journal where they're leading political
correspondent charge old side
I commented a couple of days ago that
there's a big problem in the Middle East
we have not yet learned how to control
the new forces that are emerging the
assumption is well of course we have to
control them that's our right and our
duty that we have to learn how from the
outset of the war second world war in
1939 Washington anticipated that it that
the war would end with the United States
in a position of overwhelming power
high-level state Department officials
and non-governmental foreign policy
speculate specialists that met regularly
through the wartime years they laid out
plans for the post-war world they
delineate it what they called a grand
area that the u.s. was to dominate the
grand area was to include at least the
Western Hemisphere the entire Far East
and the British Empire which the US was
planning to take over including the US
Middle East energy resources the British
Foreign Office was aware of this if you
look at their documents not very happy
about it but I said we're going to have
to recognize there's going to be a
junior partner say called as an evolving
world order the well that was in the
early years of the of the war as Russian
forces started to grind down the Nazi
armies after Stalingrad the conception
of the grand area was enlarged to
include as much of Eurasia as possible
including certainly the industrial and
commercial center the heartland of
Western Europe now within the Grand area
and now quoting within the Grand area
the US was to maintain unquestioned
power with military and economic
supremacy while ensuring the limitation
of any exercise of sovereign
by states that might interfere with its
global designs that's a live policy
right now i'll come back to crucial
instances when should bear in mind how
mineral the doctrine is and how
appropriate to the nature of the world
that was in fact emerging have to
remember that when the second world war
ended the u.s. literally had half the
world's wealth position of power of
security that was totally unfair allel
nothing like it in history and that was
understood it's quite clear from the
documentary record i'm quoting now that
President Roosevelt was aiming at United
States hegemony in the postwar world
that's quoting the British diplomatic
historian Jeffrey Warner quite an
accurate assessment and more significant
the careful wartime plans were
implemented in very much the terms in
which they were outlined during the war
they were implemented shortly after well
it was always recognized from the
beginning that Europe might choose to
follow an independent path NATO was
partially intended to counter this
threat and rather strikingly as soon as
the official pretext for NATO you know
protecting Europe from the Russian
hordes as soon as that dissolved in 1989
reflexively NATO was expanded if anyone
had believed the propaganda should have
disappeared instead it expanded and one
of the interesting things that happened
in 1989 is a lot of clouds lifted we
could sort of see policy less concealed
by ideology so natives expanded to the
east that was in violation of verbal
pledges to Gorbachev which he was naive
enough to believe he's pretty irritated
by it that nothing he could do and it's
since been expanded beyond now it's a
u.s. run
intervention force and it has an
official task the official task is
controlling the crucial infrastructure
of the global energy system that's quite
an expansive role and that's what NATO
is now committed to the grand area
doctrine limits of the sovereignty of
others explicitly but it grants the
United States unrestricted rights that's
what it means to be a global hegemon and
that was made very clear that explicit
at once for example in 1946 when the
u.s. agreed to a world court
jurisdiction but with a condition the
condition was that the United States
would not be subject to any
international treaties meaning the UN
Charter the Charter of the Organization
of American States later the Genocide
Convention and so on that that this has
come up before the court repeatedly
under court has accepted and as it was
required to the reservation that none of
these trees apply to the United States
the principles also clearly license
military intervention at will and that
conclusion has been clearly not not only
implemented continuously but also pretty
clearly articulated and one tends to
think of the right wing administration's
with X misleading one of the most
expansive forms of the doctrine was
under Clinton in fact Bill Clinton the
Clinton administration declared quote
that the United States has the right to
use military force unilaterally to
ensure uninhibited access to key markets
energy supplies and strategic resources
and must maintain military forces
forward deployed in Europe and Asia in
order to shape people's opinions about
us and to shape events
will affect their livelihood in our
security that's actually much more
expansive than the much-maligned George
W Bush Doctrine they came later the
Clinton doctrine doesn't even require
the pretexts that the Bush Doctrine
insisted on but it was presented
politely so therefore didn't arouse much
interest actually the antagonism towards
Bush was almost entirely style not
substance the substance is pretty
standard the I think that's one of the
reasons Obama was so welcomed in Europe
the style changed not the substance but
the same principles governed the
invasion of Iraq that became clearer as
us failure to impose it soon this will
became clearer at that as that preceded
the actual goals of the invasion
couldn't be concealed any longer behind
pretty rhetoric about you know democracy
and all sorts of nice things in november
two thousand seven the white house
issued I would have called a declaration
of principles concerning Iraq two main
points the one was that US forces must
remain indefinitely in Iraq big military
bases right to carry out combat
operations and secondly that Iraq must
privilege us investors two months later
January 2008 President Bush informed
Congress that he would reject
legislation that might limit the
permanent stationing of US armed forces
in Iraq or us control of the oil
resources of Iraq I'm quoting the these
are demands incidentally that the United
States had to abandon shortly after in
the face of Iraqi resistance as it had
been forced to back off step by step all
the way through that's a
major triumph of nonviolent resistance
that the US and Britain have no trouble
at all killing insurgents they're very
good at killing people but they couldn't
deal with the mass nonviolent resistance
the hundreds of thousands of people were
demonstrating protesting so I had to
back off and finally the basic war aims
were abandoned articulated pretty
clearly as they were being abandoned
that's a major defeat as Jonathan Steele
and other serious analysts have
recognized in Tunisia and Egypt today
the popular uprising has scored quite
impressive victories but as the Carnegie
Endowment reported a few days ago its
research group while names have changed
the regime's remain the as they point
out a change in ruling elites and the
system of governance is still a distant
goal maybe it'll be achieved maybe not
it's not going to be easy the report
discusses a variety of internal barriers
to such changes to democracy but it
ignores as usual the external barriers
which is always are quite significant
the United States and its Western Allies
are assured to do whatever they can to
prevent authentic democracy in the Arab
world and the very simple reasons for
that to understand why it's only
necessary to look at the studies of Arab
opinion which are conducted by the most
prestigious us polling agencies released
by a major institutions like the booking
institution they reveal that by
overwhelming majorities Arabs regard the
US and Israel as the major threats they
face the United stage if the United
States is regarded as the major threat
by ninety percent of Egyptians in the
region generally not much less than that
some regard Iran as a threat ten percent
opposition the US policy is so strong
that a majority believe that the region
would be that security would be improved
for the region if Iran had nuclear
weapons in Egypt that's eighty percent
other figures are similar if public
opinion were to influence policy the
United States would not only not control
the region but it would be expelled from
it written as well along with its allies
that would undermine fundamental
principles of global domination that
have been operative in their current
form since the Second World War and as
far as Britain's concerned back long
before then a general support for
democracy is the province of ideologists
and propagandists in the real world as
the more serious scholarship has
conceded the US and its allies support
democracy if and only if it corresponds
to strategic and economic objectives
actually Stalin would have said the same
thing Elite contempt for democracy was
revealed very dramatically in the
reaction to the recent WikiLeaks
exposures the ones that received the
most attention with euphoric commentary
were the cables that reported that Arabs
support the u.s. stand on Iraq really
important the reference was reflexively
to the ruling dictators the attitudes of
the public were unmentioned the guiding
principle behind this apart from the
obvious contempt for democracy on the
part of the general intellectual
community the guiding principle was
articulated quite clearly by a Carnegie
Endowment Middle East specialist the
Marwan washer he's formerly a
high official of the Jordanian
dictatorship the principle is there's
nothing wrong everything is under
control in short as long as the
dictators support us what else could
matter the moisture doctrine is rational
and venerable to mention just one case
that's highly relevant today and my
opinion ought to be in the front pages
in 1958 President Eisenhower expressed
in internal discussion since
Declassified he expressed concern about
what he called the campaign of hatred
against us in the Arab world and not by
governments but by the people the
National Security Council explained at
the same time the reasons for it this is
the highest planning body they said
there's a perception in the Arab world
that the United States supports
dictatorships and blocks democracy and
development and that we do that so as to
ensure control over the resources of the
region and furthermore they went on to
say that the perception is basically
accurate and that that's exactly what we
should be doing relying on the mawashi
doctrine as long as people are quiet
everything's under control it's fine the
after 911 there were internal government
studies US government studies which
confirmed that the same is true they
responded that george w bush's plaintiff
CLE that they hate our freedoms they
concluded that no they don't hate our
freedoms they hate our policies and with
good reason same reason they did in the
1950s actually 1958 was a particularly
interesting moment because that was just
two years after eisenhower had expelled
Britain France and Israel from Egyptian
territory that not incidentally because
he disapproved the
the Asian thought that was okay but the
timing was bad and interfered with a
u.s. planned coup in Syria and he didn't
like the disobedience Britain France and
Israel are supposed to understand who's
boss and not to carry out operations
like this without informing the master
so they were summarily expelled and you
might have guessed that our public
opinion would be favorable to the US
after this but they perceived things a
little more deeply than Western
ideologists so yes there was a campaign
of hatred for the reasons that the NSC
National Security Council articulated
the current polls which I mentioned
indicate that how little anything has
changed in this regard not at all in
fact well it's if we look back a little
farther to history there are some
lessons there too it's quite normal for
the victors to regard history is bunk
you know consign it to the trash can who
cares let's look ahead it's also quite
normal for the victims to take history
seriously for pretty good reasons
they're just make a few observations
it's a very important matter I'll just
barely touch it but could be useful to
think about it a little today is
actually not the first occasion when
Egypt and the United States are in
somewhat similar situations the that was
also true in the early part of the 19th
century that economic historians have
argued that in that at that time say
around 1830 Egypt was well placed to
undertake rapid economic development
about the same time the US was beginning
to do so both Egypt in the US had rich
agriculture that included cotton which
is sort of the oil of the 19th century
the fuel of the early Industrial
Revolution though there was a difference
unlike Egypt the United States had to
develop cotton production at a workforce
by conquest
the extermination and slavery the
consequences are still very much alive
all you have to do is take a look at the
reservations for the survivors of the
extermination program and also at the
prisons that have expanded very rapidly
since the Reagan years and far beyond
any other country and the needed there
needed to house the superfluous
population left over by the
industrialization there's a pretty close
race class correlation so it ends up
being largely black some extent Hispanic
there was however one fundamental
difference between Egypt in the United
States at that time the United States
had gained independence and it was there
for free to ignore the prescriptions of
economic theory they were delivered at
the time by Adam Smith in terms quite
similar to those that are prescribed
forced sometimes for the so-called
developing societies today Smith right
away urged the at the time of the war of
independence he urged the liberated
colonies to produce primary products for
export and to import superior British
manufacturers and certainly not to
monopolize crucial goods like
particularly cotton any other path he
said would retard instead of
accelerating the further increase in the
value of their annual produce and would
obstruct instead of promoting the
progress of their country towards real
wealth and greatness familiar words
festival Blessid was elegantly today but
same simms same prescriptions well the
colonies gained their independence and
so therefore they were free to ignore
the principles of sound economics and
they were able to follow England's own
course of
state guided independent development
this was in fact the case and so the
colonies right away imposed hike very
high tariffs to protect industry from
superior British exports at first
textiles later steel and others and a
range of other devices to accelerate
economic development the independent
republic also proceeded to try to gain a
monopoly of cotton that was the primary
goal behind the conquest of Texas and
conquest of half of Mexico and the goal
was quite explicit the Jacksonian
presidents explained that if the United
States could gain a monopoly of cotton
we could place all other nations at our
feet particularly the British enemy
which was the main impediment to
expansion that's why Canada is still
technically free of becoming slowly
incorporated by other means the the for
Egypt on the other hand a comparable
course was barred by British power Lord
Palmerston declared that no ideas of
fairness towards Egypt or to stand in
the way of such great and paramount
interests of Britain as preserving its
economic and political hegemony he also
expressed what he called his hate for
the ignorant barbarian Muhammad Ali
modernising leader who dared to seek an
independent course and the Britain was
able to deploy its fleet and its
financial power to terminate to Egypt's
quest for independence and economic
development its policies like these
incidentally that are substantially
responsible for the divide that
developed between what we call the first
in the third world they were not very
different and
that period after World War two the
United States replaced Britain as global
hegemon and the united states adopted
exactly the same stand the u.s. made it
clear that it would provide no aid to
egypt unless egypt that here including
standard rules for the week adam smith's
prescriptions IMF World Bank
prescriptions the US of course continued
to violate them but that's according to
the regular principles as wells of the
u.s. imposed high tariffs high tariffs
on Egyptian cotton to protect us cotton
production and it led to a terrible
dollar shortage in Egypt that's the
usual interpretation of market
principles going back centuries market
principles are kind of like democracy
you appeal to them when they're useful
disregard them when they're harmful so
it's not too surprising that to see the
campaign of hatred against the United
States that concerned eisenhower over 50
years ago based on the recognition that
the United States like Britain France
others with the power to do so the
United States supports dictators blocks
democracy and development and thus over
quite understandable reasons in Adam
Smith's defense i should mention that he
recognized what would happen to britain
if it adhere to the rules of sound
economics as this what's now more or
less called neoliberalism that he warned
that if British manufacturers merchants
and investors turned abroad they might
profit but England would suffer however
he felt that they would be guided by
what's sometimes called a home bias
they'd prefer the home country so as if
by an invisible hand England would be
spared the ravages of
a classical of economics called economic
rationality actually that passage and
wealth of nations is pretty hard to miss
it's the only passage in which the
famous phrase invisible hands appears in
a critique of what we now call
neoliberalism and a warning against it
the other leading founder of classical
economics David Ricardo he drew pretty
similar conclusions he explained that he
hoped that home bias would quoting him
now would lead men of property to be
satisfied with the low rate of profits
in their own country rather than seek a
more advantageous deployment for their
wealth in foreign nations speaking of
England of course and he said these are
feelings that I would be sorry to see
weakened putting aside their predictions
the instincts of the classical
economists were quite sound well going
back to coming back to today the
democracy uprisings in the Arab world
are pretty commonly compared to Eastern
Europe in 1989 but that's a rather
dubious comparison in 1989 the democracy
uprising was supported by Western powers
in accord with a standard doctrine that
democracy is fine if it satisfies
strategic and economic interest
furthermore the democracy uprisings were
tolerated by the dominant power in the
region by Russia almost exactly the
opposite of what's happening now there's
no Gorbachev in the West quite the
contrary and western power remains a
hostile to democracy in the Arab world
for quite sound reasons those that I
mentioned so a more relevant comparison
and one which is never drawn but I think
it is more relevant would be two events
that were taking place in u.s. domains
at exactly the same time 1989 so for
example a few days after the fall of the
Berlin Wall and elite
salvadoran battalion was fresh from
renewed training in the John F Kennedy
