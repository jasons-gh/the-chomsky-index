the phrase class warfare has been coming
up a lot in recent months it seems that
the charge is leveled against any public
official who speaks honestly about the
economic realities facing millions of
Americans Noam Chomsky says it's the
corporations who are waging that war and
their targets are working people in this
country and around the world Chomsky is
a professor of linguistics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology he
is considered a leading intellectual of
our time here's an excerpt of a recent
speech he gave at Harvard University at
a day-long conference organized by jobs
with justice his speech is called the
corporate war on working people well
there are four sort of obvious topics to
discuss and I'll try to say something
about each of them one is the question
what kinds of social policy are being
designed and applied to the American
population right around now to what are
the likely consequences of these
policies 3 why is it now not let's say
30 years ago and for what can we do
about it well the first one what kinds
of policies are being designed they have
a name although it's not usually applied
here they're a variant of what it's
sometimes called the Washington
Consensus or structural adjustment or
neoliberalism or various other similar
names these are the policies that are
rammed down the throats of the most of
the third world that includes now the
restored third world in Eastern Europe
and the policies of the Washington
Consensus our first to reduce the size
of government it's called fiscal
conservatism or something like that have
small balanced budget cut public
expenditures social spending health
education the general principle is cut
any use of public funds to benefit the
public I mean that's essential principle
number
I you give it various fancy names but
it's what comes down to second feature
the washing consensus is to make the tax
system or regressive it's already very
regressive so for example in the United
States it's been flat for years but the
idea is to make it more regressive so
for example as applied to the United
States I'm saying in the third world as
applied to the United States the next
big thing online is to reduce taxes on
financial gains that's about half thin
for the top 1% of the population and
obviously declining very fast as you
move down the wealth level third part of
the Washington Consensus is deregulation
fourth part is privatization fifth part
is stronger government guarantees the
Washington Consensus involves both
strengthening and weakening government
it's stronger government guarantees for
property rights the sixth part is
reduction of trade barriers well I'll
come back to what those mean but the
general consequences are reasonably
clear other take a look at the third
world you see the general consequences
one consequence is that the designers of
the experiment namely the designers of
the Washington Consensus of the IMF the
World Bank the major transnational
corporations that lie behind them and so
on the designers of the experiment come
out doing very very well they gain vary
greatly from the experiment actually
that's a bad as near to a universal
principle was history provides these
experiments go back hundreds of years
and I have yet to find one where the
designers didn't come out very very well
off that's kind of like an accident
which you're not supposed to notice the
what about the experimental animals who
are very rarely asked for permission
well they tend to do
very badly in the third world yep it's a
little nuance there's a small sector
namely those who cooperate with the
experiment they do very well too so a
typical third world country has a small
sector of the population which lives an
extraordinary wealth and opulence and
they're kind of connected with the
ongoing experiments and they're the ones
who write the articles and the books and
so on so they think it's all great and
they advocated and so on for the rest of
the population outside of a small sector
this runs across any third world Society
look at they live somewhere between
suffering and misery you know some
depends on the society most of them it's
closer to misery I the as the
experiments proceed it gets closer and
closer to that then there's another part
of the population which is simply
superfluous I mean they don't contribute
anything to wealth creation and you got
to do something with them like if it's a
Columbia which gets half of US military
aid for the hemisphere and as the worst
human rights record in the hemisphere
then what you do with them is send out
the military forces or the power
military forces to murderer they're
called disposable people in other places
you do it in various other different
ways but somehow you just get rid of
them so that's a typical third world
society small sector of great wealth
large mass of the population facing one
or another problem from down the misery
and then disposable people that's fairly
uniform and that's in a uniform
consequence of these experiments which
incidentally have been going on for
hundreds of years so the general
principle is designers do great ones who
cooperate with them to great the
experimental animals only by accident do
they gain anything mostly they suffer
quite a bit one standard consequence of
contemporary structural adjustment
programs in fact Universal is that the
share of Labor in national income
declined that's regular property of them
well this again is something you're not
supposed to note
you know it just sort of happens
incidentally another thing that happens
is after the experiments are over you
know like some years down the road
there's a kind of an analysis and
they're called a failure for some
strange reason they fail although oddly
they always succeeded in something that
might be thought of a success namely
enriching the designers and the people
who collaborated with their called a
failure for everyone else on a tacit
assumption which is that everything the
rich and powerful people do is only
designed for the benefit of everyone how
could it be otherwise because we're so
perfect so therefore since it seemed to
harm everyone it must have been a fat
Aaron just by accident that benefited us
and our collaborators well actually I
know a lot of your students so if they
happen to be somebody who's looking for
a really good dissertation topic one
where you're you know the answer in
advance that's the best kind boy it's
fill in the details and one that has
another predictable outcome you'll never
get a job if you want a topic like that
then what you might do is do a study of
the experiments that have been carried
out say starting with the British
permanent settlement in India in 19m
1793 and going up to say USAID's project
of turning Haiti into the Taiwan of the
Caribbean in the 1980s or the shock
therapy and say Bolivia or Eastern
Europe just run through the whole series
and find out just check off how many
times this consequence fails consequence
great for the designers great for the
collaborators disaster for the
experimental animals a wrap up later
which says do you understand it but it
seems to a fail that's the job of the
academics and intellectuals and so on in
interesting topic I leave it to you well
point is that these policies are by no
means new and it's now called the
Washington Consensus but one or another
variety of its
on for hundreds of years if you go back
to the 18th century what is today the
first world in the third world were much
more similar than they are now far more
you can argue about the reasons for the
split but I don't think that's very much
doubt that one of the reasons for the
split and probably a rather significant
element in it was that neoliberal
programs of one or another variety were
forced on what is now the third world
well the first world adhered this strong
protectionism you know a powerful state
to protect the wealthy for the most part
but often much of the population from
market discipline and so on that split
is certainly a factor you could argue
how much I would think a major factor in
leading to this very sharp different
classic example is written in India
first big case India was the
manufacturing center of the world from
say 1600 1800 it was d industrialized by
force the British forced on it what are
now called neoliberal policies I mean
and mean and it turned it into a
backward rural eyes dim poverty country
and that's been replicated elsewhere so
for example in Europe Germany developed
exactly the same way high protectionism
state intervention and so on same is
true of France and Italy if you look
outside of Europe and the rest pretty
much the rest of Europe you go outside
of Europe there are two areas of the
world that have developed namely the two
that resisted European colonization one
is the United States after the colonies
freed themselves from your British
colonization they were able to follow
the British model in fact even more
intensively the United States with the
model of the interventionist
protectionists developmental state
tariffs way higher than anybody else you
know powerful state intervention to keep
cotton cheap by massacring the
indigenous population and bringing in
slaves that's incidentally not usually
included in economic history for some
reason
though it's plainly a kind of a market
interference of a rather serious sort
and so it goes from textiles to steal
and onto computers and electronics and
aviation and the rest of it that's the
United States out the other area that
developed was Japan which also resisted
European colonization and then followed
pretty much the same direction that
Europe and the United States did with
some of its colonies in tow that's a
pretty general principle the parts of
the world that we're able to develop
were those that were able to protect
themselves from the neoliberal i model
thats impose none everyone else simply
just if you look at the details it's
even more you know becomes even more
clear okay that's pretty much the
history I think you'll find and coming
back to what's being happening here
we're getting what there is something
new going on what's new that's going on
is now these policies are also being
applied in a certain sense to the
industrial societies themselves well for
those who are interested in the real
world look at the actual history
suggests an adjustment a modification of
free market theory to what we might call
really existing free market theory that
is the one that's actually applied not
talked about and the principle of really
existing free market theory is free
markets are fine for you but not for me
that's again near a universal so you
whoever you may be you have to learn
responsibility and be subjected to
market discipline it's good for your
character it's tough love and so on and
so forth but me I need the nanny state
to protect me from market discipline so
that I'll be able to ramped and rave
about the
marvels of the free market well I'm
getting properly subsidized and defended
by everyone else through the nanny state
and also this has to be risk-free so I'm
perfectly willing to make profits but I
don't want to take risks if anything
goes wrong you bail me out ok so if
third world debt gets out of control you
socialize it it's not the problem the
banks that made the money when the SNL's
collapse no same thing public bells
amount when American investment firms
get into trouble because the Mexican
bubble bursts you bail out in Goldman
Sachs and the Mexico bailout and on and
on I'm in this case after case of this
in fact of the leading top 100 leading
transnationals in the fortune list of
transnationals there was a recent study
of how they how they related to the
states in which they're all somewhere
you know so they're all mostly here in
some national state turns out that all
hundred of them had benefited from
industrial policies meaning state
intervention and their behalf all
hundred had benefited from the state in
which they're based in 20 of the hundred
had been saved from total disaster that
is collapse by just state bailout when
people talk about globalization of the
economy remember that the nanny state
has to be very powerful in order to bail
out the rich and nothing is changing in
that regard 20 out of a hundred again
were saved from collapse by this
including a number here well that's
really existing free market theory there
are many examples of it quite close to
home so we could start with their own
governor Governor weld who's described
by the boston globe as a libertarian
with a religious belief in free markets
and then a couple of days later they
reported that through various scams he
had his administration was able to
sharply increase federal subsidies to
massachusetts so that way beyond what
they were before so that he could parade
as a fist
conservative and that's pretty common
just a year before you may recall the
long memories they had to close Georges
Bank the richest fishing area in the
world because it was over being
overfished thanks to a combination of
deregulation and subsidies of the
fishing industry which have that odd
consequence that you tend to get
overfishing so it looked as if the
ground fish were wiped out and he closed
it off it didn't take long for the
religious conservative or tarian fanatic
William well to take the next jet plane
down the Washington hat in hand asking
for a federal bailout he wanted the
national federal government to declare
it a natural disaster and the reason was
as he explained with presumably some
scientists and so that there was some
strange kind of predatory fish which no
one had yet found but they would find it
don't worry so some kind of predatory
fish had come and sort of wiped out all
the you know the cod and haddock and all
those things so it was a natural
disaster and therefore the general
public had to sort of pay off the
results of deregulation and subsidizing
the fishing industry well that's the way
to be a libertarian with religious
fervor another one is the leader of the
conservative revolution of Gingrich
nobody's more passionate about the
market then he is particular about his
own district which he calls a Norman
Rockwell world of jet planes and fiber
optics as indeed it is except if you ask
where jet planes and fiber optics came
from you discover that the public paid
for them and still pays for them and in
fact he manages to get more federal
subsidies for his district than any
suburban county in the country outside
the federal system so you can have
conservatism flowering among the malls
and so on or you go back to the Reagan
nights were also very passionate about
free markets for everyone else meanwhile
they boasted the American business
community correctly that they had done
more that they didn't
more protection than any post-war
American administration in fact more
than all of them combined they had
doubled import restrictions blocking and
recap helped and poured public funds
into major industries to enable them to
recapitalize to protect the in fact
reconstruct the steel industry in the
automotive industry in the
semiconductors and so on which would
have disappeared if they'd opened the
markets other thatcherite sin england
were about the same government
expenditures relative to GNP stayed
pretty constant although anything that
went to the general population collapsed
meanwhile military industry shot up the
arm sales or booming think that's all
publicly subsidized stuff arms sales to
nice guys like saddam hussein and
general support though and others well
that's a really existing free market
theory Noam Chomsky is professor of
linguistics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology his speech given
at a day-long conference organized by
jobs with justice is called the
corporate war on working people as
members of Congress led by Newt Gingrich
are currently fighting for an increase
in military spending we turn to a recent
speech of MIT professor Noam Chomsky he
talks about how the US budget is looking
increasingly like the structural
adjustment programs the US imposes on
developing countries the Washington
Consensus which is basically designed
for the third world to make it that way
and keep it that way it's now being
applied not just to the third world
countries but to with a rich industrial
societies with the United States and
Britain in the lead however it's with a
twist since it's being applied at home
this is really existing free market
theory that's being applied at home
meaning nuanced you know so powerful
government to protect the rich and
market discipline and tough love for
everyone else and you see that very
clearly go through the various elements
of the Washington Consensus that I
mentioned the first one is to
about reducing government well that's
false we're not reducing government
we're switching shifting it around so
social spending is indeed way down since
the 1970s when this started accelerated
after nineteen eighty but starting in
the mid 70s the kind of a benchmark
example was AFDC main support system
that was cut up virtually in half from
about 1972 1990 with obvious effects on
where families and children and so on it
was part of the general war against
women and children that was conducted by
the conservatives under the name of
Family Values it's interesting that they
really get away with that that tells you
something about the intellectual culture
well one part was the reduction of AFDC
from by roughly half from about 1970
about 1990s now essentially gone that's
a purpose of that as you know is so that
seven million couple of million I think
five or six million kids average seven
years old can learn responsibility
that's part of tough love meanwhile
another part of the government has been
very stable and in fact is going up
namely the Pentagon system which remains
at approximately Cold War levels fact
higher now than it was under Nixon
although you know the big enemy is
disappeared which tells you exactly how
much tells a rational person at least
exactly how much they were worried about
the Russian threat at nine either remain
at Cold War levels but it's going up
under the initiative of the fiscal
conservatives the Heritage Foundation
which you know so the right-wing
foundation that designs the budget for
the Gingrich army are calling for an
increase in the Pentagon system as is
Gingrich as indeed was Clinton so that
goes up and i should say the cutting of
social spending social spendings being
cut very sharply very much over public
opposition at the time
the 1994 congressional election you know
the big landslide over sixty percent of
the public wanted and social spending to
increase okay went very sharply down
what about Pentagon spending going up
well that's public is six to one opposed
to that which gives you some one one
aspect of a big picture about what's
happening to American democracy and
somewhat of a change not a huge change
the so one part of the system is going
up Pentagon spending another parts going
down social spending and the same is
true in other domains like for example
legal aid for the poor is being slashed
and virtually destroyed on the other
hand the security system States the
government security system state and
federal let's going up so prisons are
going way up the prison population crime
hasn't really hasn't changed for about
twenty years but and instantly us crime
rates are not off the spectrum contrary
to what a lot of people believe crime
rates are sort of it toward the high end
of the industrial world but not off the
spectrum with one exception namely
murder with guns but that's a special
feature of American society just enough
do with crime rate apart from that crime
rates are kind of toward the high end
not going up the prison population
tripled during the Reagan years is going
up even faster now and I think the
reason is another aspect of the third
world model namely the superfluous
population there is a big superfluous
population they don't contribute the
wealth protection well we're civilized
folks we're not like the people we fund
in Colombia who go out and murder them
so we throw them into jail I and that's
going way up in even more and there's
also a kind of a side benefit to this
the putting more and more people in jail
and in fact under harsher and harsher
conditions has is a technique of social
control for everybody else I mean when
you're if you're you know when
they down the road you decide to run a
dictatorship and you want to really harm
people it's kind of like Hitler's
Germany or something you know you you
know that you're going to carry out
policies are going to cause people a lot
of harm you got to control them somehow
and there aren't many ways to do it
everyone hits on the same ways what you
do is engender fear and hatred then you
know make them hate the guy who looks a
little different or whatever it may be
and then you punish those bad guys
because they're really awful and punish
them really hard and so on and that
makes people even more frightened you
can just see that happening right around
you and building up the perception of
crime crime has a like a what they call
in literary theory a subtext you're
supposed to understand criminal has the
word little word black in front of it
just like welfare mother you know black
rich black welfare mother and the year
and criminal means you know that black
guy is coming after you so what you want
to do is this has the dual effect of
getting rid of a superfluous population
basically unskilled workers close race
class correlation and also demonizing
them so everybody else is scared
frightened and they'll be willing to
accept what's happening to them too and
not look at where the sources so that
part of the drug wars basically for this
as almost nothing to do with drugs but
it has plenty to do with criminalizing
an unwanted population and scaring
everybody else that's and so does the
harsh inning of prison conditions which
is really the United States off the map
on this violation of international
conventions constantly condemned the
human rights forums and getting much
worse the reinstitution of chain gangs
was of course bitterly condemned but you
know that's that bad South Alabama well
it's now in Illinois the state Senate of
Illinois
last week or two ago legislated chain
gangs not for violent criminals
incidentally for people who are found
with drugs or you know robbing the store
or something like that the Chicago Press
pointed out this carries this kind of
reminiscent of slavery but the
legislature in the senator state senator
who put it through said that this is
just another aspect of what he called
tough love and then he explained that
some people work better under
humiliation so it's really good to
restore elements of slavery and again
the subtext is everybody else gets
scared you know if those guys have to
walk around like slaves and chains we
must be in real danger so therefore will
accept what's happening to us that's the
logic so prisons are going up and it's
and that has a lot of side benefits
apart from just getting rid of perf
Louis population it is a source of cheap
labor so prison labor is going way up
cheap labor not to worry about unions no
benefits they don't get out of line for
and that also naturally undercuts wages
elsewhere so when just like forcing
welfare mothers to work you know raising
children isn't work as anybody knows
who's had children so you have to drive
in the work kind of like people would go
to you know fidelity investment to
figure out scams but I have to deal with
security market really want these people
to work but since there's no jobs for
them they're going to work at low paid
or so publicly subsidized wages which
will undercut other wages and the same
with prison labor all that in fact the
scale of prison construction which is it
kind of Keynesian stimulus to the
economy anyway but its scale has become
so enormous that even high-tech industry
you know the guys who are usually just
ripping off the Pentagon system they're
beginning to look at it figuring out
recognizing that high-tech surveillance
devices and so on may be another way to
sort of get the transfer of public funds
to make sure that high-tech industry
keeps moving it's reached its not the
scale of the Pentagon but it's going
well that's one aspect of what's called
reducing government modifying government
to be more precise another aspect of it
is what's called devolution reducing
moving governmental power from federal
to the state level and that has a kind
of a rationale which you hear all over
the time a place for example it was an
op het a couple of weeks ago in the New
York Times by John Cogan of Hoover
Institute at Stanford who's pointed out
what he called a philosophical issue
that divides the Democrats and the
Republicans the philosophical issue is
that the Democrats believe in big
government and entitlement and the
Republicans believe in getting power
down closer to the people to the states
because they're kind of populist types
well it takes about maybe three seconds
thought to recognize that realize that
moving power down to the states in
funding and so on is just moving it away
from the people for perfectly elementary
reason there's a hidden part of the
system of the power system that you're
not supposed to know about or think
about and that's private power now it
takes a big corporation likes a general
electric or Microsoft to sort of
pressure the federal government but even
middle sized guys have no problems with
state governments they can control and
plate easily and in case anyone was too
dull to figure this out by themselves
the same day as cogans up at in the New
York Times which is a typical one there
was a story in The Wall Street Journal
about Massachusetts which had a headline
that read what fidelity investment wants
it usually gets okay and then the story
went on to say that fidelity investment
the because investment firm in
Massachusetts wanted even more subsidy
and support from the state government
that it already gets and it was
threatening if it didn't it would move
over
order to Rhode Island where it just owns
the place so therefore the passionately
libertarian governor quickly rearranged
you know tax subsidies and one thing or
another so that fidelity got what it
wanted well fidelity couldn't have done
that with the federal government
couldn't have said you know you give us
even more we're going to move to
Switzerland or something I mean other
guys can do it maybe but not fidelity
raytheon it's as big as manufacturing
producer did the same thing raytheon
instantly filled fidelity is not
something fidelity's poorer they just
announced record record profits couple
days ago same with raytheon just
announced record profits but you know
having big problems so they wanted even
a bigger tax subsidy and direct subsidy
in tax write-offs which just means
transfer of taxes through from the state
of Massachusetts and they threatened if
they didn't get them they were going to
go to Tennessee's of course they got
them the legislature passed a special
law giving what they call defense
industry special extra subsidies notice
that Raytheon is publicly subsidized in
the first place that's where its money
comes from but now it has to be an
additionally subsidized so that its
profits will be even higher than the
record profits it just made same with
fidelity and that's the kind of game
anybody can you know even even way down
that much smaller businesses can play
with states so moving devolution the
consequences of evolution are quite
straight forward it means that any
funding that goes to say block grants
that go to the state you can be
reasonably confident that they'll end up
in the deep pockets of rich people not
you know in the in the hands of hungry
children or we're mothers or anything
like that that's how you get power down
to the people okay that's devolution in
fact quite generally when you look at it
what's called government cutting is is
more or less cost transfer it's almost
never reduction sometimes it's increase
so let's take what's picked health
reform reform is a word you always
watch out for you know like when mal
called started that Cultural Revolution
wasn't called a reform you know reform
is a change that you're supposed to like
okay and what so as soon as you hear the
word reform you can reach for your
wallet and see who is lifting it anyhow
there are things called health reforms
and the health reforms are supposed to
you know cut government costs well they
do cut one kind of cost but of course
they raise another kind of cost and
furthermore it's no big secret so like
The Wall Street Journal had a headline
which pointed out that when the reforms
were you know moving through Congress it
said rich gained poor lose trade-offs
for the middle class okay which is right
that's exactly what the reforms are
intended to do you have to remember my
middle class they mean the people right
below the very rich so they don't mean
the median you know that I'm talking
about people with 30,000 a year income
they mean ever you know so what it
really means is great for the rich
super-rich trade-offs for the near rich
tough business tough love for everybody
else which is most every year when you
close public hospitals and that sort of
thing you know exactly who's going to
suffer well let's go to what are called
takes a new york which it has to a
conservative governor and conservative
mayor and they're carrying out very
extensive conservative tax cuts because
their fiscal conservatives the tax cuts
the New York Times pointed out in a
small item all benefit business so by
accident all the tax cuts benefit
business well there are also tax
increases which are compensating for the
tax cuts but don't call them tax
increases what they call them is the
phrase is reduction of subsidies for
public transportation and for tuition
and public universities well subsidy
itself is another interesting word kind
of like reform it's a subsidy
if public funds are used for public
purposes that's called a subsidy it's
not called a subsidy when they go to
private wealth that's reform or
something so the so they're cutting down
subsidies for public transportation well
that's just tax you know if you pay
twenty percent more for getting on the
subway that's tax the same if you pay
higher tuition at the City College and
that's a highly regressive tax so who
rides the subways and who goes to City
College so what the doing is shifty is
cutting taxes for business for the rich
and increasing taxes for the poor which
are going to compensate for that and
that's called fiscal conservatism MIT
professor Noam Chomsky America's leading
progressive intellectual speaking
recently at an all-day forum at harvard
university sponsored by jobs for justice
the speech was recorded by chuck rosina
of WM BR in cambridge massachusetts and
if you know of an interesting speech
coming up why don't you record it or let
us know about it will give the number at
the end of the show I'm Amy Goodman
you're listening to Democracy Now
