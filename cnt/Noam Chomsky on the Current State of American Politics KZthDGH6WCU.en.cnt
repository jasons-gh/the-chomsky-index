joining us today is the legendary known
Chomsky he's an American linguist
philosopher cognitive scientist
historian social critic and political
activist but if you're a TYT viewer or
you're familiar with our show I'm sure
that Chomsky needs absolutely no
introduction Noam Chomsky thank you so
much for joining us on TYT be with you I
want to get right to the topics that
I've been dying to ask you about and I
don't want to waste any time
starting with what happened last night
with the State of the Union address
there was one moment at the very end
where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took
Donald Trump's speech and she ripped it
up knowing full well that she would be
on camera and that it would get quite a
bit of media attention it certainly did
get a bit of media attention and she is
being applauded as you know part of the
resistance to Donald Trump however
critics such as myself have been dragged
through the mud because of the fact that
I've criticized Pelosi for doing that
not because I have any type of love or
admiration for Donald Trump but because
I see that as political theater that
stands as a substitute for real
resistance or political activism to
represent the people I wanted to get
your thoughts on it though I didn't
watch it so I've only read the reports
but I basically agree with you I think
they're much more significant ways of
responding than tearing something now
why is it that when it comes to true
political activism that represents the
working people of this country be it
Occupy Wall Street or any type of
political uprising that tends to get a
very different reaction in the media but
when it comes to symbolic gestures like
ripping up a speech or maybe clapping in
a sarcastic manner during the State of
the Union that gets much more positive
reaction from the press and I know that
this is all really part of what you have
written about extensively manufacturing
consent but is this something that you
think do you think Americans are waking
up to it or is this something that's
really going to keep people complacent I
think it's some wake up to snow me
except the it's understandable that
substantive issues are evaded their
brother toxic so for example if you
bring up the the things that were not
discussed in thee the most important
aspect of the speech is as orphans the
case what was not discussed so for
example there was nothing in the speech
about how the donald trump is leading
the world towards destruction of the
possibilities for organized human life
in the near future but by his
disgraceful and destructive climate
policies there was nothing in the speech
about how he's tearing the last shreds
of the arms control regime to shreds
causing great dangers to the world and
ourselves and other things but the media
car focus on that because that was cut
we should pursue those issues they cut
right to the part of the nature of our
institutions and lead to serious
challenges of those institutions than
the calls to significantly change them
that's not something the media wanted
the winter it's much easier to divert
attention to whether it's right or wrong
to tear up a piece of paper
unintelligent you know one of the harsh
realizations that i've come to and i'm
embarrassed to say this was recent is
that the media and journalism doesn't
really carry out what i was taught it
was supposed to carry out you know it's
not a check on power in the united
states in fact IC media at this point as
an extension of political campaigns or
specific political parties and that is
of course something that you do write
about extensively and you talk about
extensively in manufacturing consent but
my question to you is
journalists no are they doing this with
these nefarious intentions or is this
something that's being done unwittingly
are they being chosen in these positions
at various media outlets because of the
fact that they already have a certain
type of ideology or do they know are
they aware that they're engaging in
nefarious actions
I suppose journalists who understand
exactly what the constraints are of how
they have to say what they're doing how
they can sometimes sneak something in
maybe in the last paragraph of a long
story that will lead people to a
different direction right suspect for
most it's just something that all will
destroy edge in animal form which not
too many people have read because it
wasn't published in Smith Hill came out
later he points out that in free in
societies generally that unpopular ideas
can be suppressed but without the use of
force and the mechanisms he says is just
a deep immersion into the dominant
culture we have a good education with
the right school losing Vista it fell
into you that there's certain things
that wouldn't do the same so for example
if you were a journalist sign writing
about say what happened a couple of days
ago a huge new discovery of the oil
petroleum returned off the coast of
South America in Viana huge bonanza for
Exxon Mobil your task is to write about
and Berta Bennett and how there are
other fields nearby which will that
maximize the radically increase the use
of fossil fuels job is not to point out
that what the these discoveries
accelerate other words to
for the human cheese and numbers others
when that this is following from a
fundamental institutional footless quiz
a market system you're supposed to make
profit and so ExxonMobil is doing its
job let's find more ways to destroy
human life in order to fill overstuffed
pockets with more dollars let's see
right that fact you're not supposed to
think it you're supposed to keep to
what's called objectivity is the
framework that's presented to you by
institutional power structures know is
that you can ask the individual but
that's very common professor Chomsky I
wanted to get your thoughts on the
impeachment investigation today the
Senate will vote to inevitably acquit
Donald Trump and so I wanted to get your
thoughts on whether this was an effort
that was worth pursuing for the
Democrats
it was completely obvious from the
beginning that the impeachment
proceedings would be a significant gift
to Donald Trump which is exactly the way
they turned out from the first moment it
was plain that this is total force I'm
sure you would watch the performance
where Chief Justice John Roberts tried
to keep a straight face while he was
swearing in the Senators each of whom
pledged that no partisan issue would
possibly influence their judgment and
behavior and of course as everyone knew
would happen they immediately proceeded
to violate the old voice acting
completely along partisan lines the
issue the main issue that the
impeachment focused on was whether
Donald Trump had used presidential
powers in an illegal way to undermine a
leading figure in the Democratic Party
okay that's wrong but is that the worst
crime you can think of Donald Trump
having committed in fact rather dramatic
reminiscent of Watergate what was
Richard Nixon's crime there were efforts
by Robert Ryan and a couple of other
senators they introduced Nixon's major
crimes and they were huge into the car
bombing of Cambodia into the impeachment
proceedings but they were knocked out
and the only thing that was left was
that Nixon had had a bunch of thugs
break into the Democratic Party
headquarters work what does this suggest
it suggests and I'll leave it to you to
figure it out but what it does indicate
is the major issues were off the agenda
it was obvious from the start that the
Republicans who were completely in
Trump's pocket would vote to acquit no
matter what the facts are and that he
would then triumphantly declare victory
so it's a it's a gift to don't from them
a farcical proceeding which can't
possibly be taken seriously now why the
Democrats decided do that I have no idea
the outcome he'll return out was never
seriously in down
well you just touched on something
that's been incredibly frustrating for
anyone who's been paying close attention
to this impeachment investigation hoping
that it would be something that would
maybe point to Donald Trump's possible
financial ties or financial crimes along
with foreign governments or his war
crimes those were issues that weren't
brought up and so while one can only
speculate as to why
want to share my speculation with you
and get your thoughts because and again
this is something that I think a lot of
progressives in the media get criticized
for pointing out I don't believe that
there's a significant difference between
the corporate Republicans or the
corporate Democrats I think that when it
comes to war crimes when it comes to
possible financial crimes when it comes
to corruption when it comes to
undermining our democratic process both
corporate Democrats and Republicans are
very much in agreement do you think that
that's the possibility behind why Nancy
Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats
decided to not bring up Donald Trump's
possible financial crimes
personally I don't doubt that Donald
Trump is committed many personal
financial crimes but that is so low on
the ranking of his crimes
that I don't really think it matters but
let's take a close look at it here is a
man who has torn to shreds of the major
international treaties the Paris
negotiations are very weak but at least
they're something at least other
countries have tried to do something
sometimes not insignificant
sometimes just and waving to try to deal
with a crisis that is going to destroy
organized human life that within a few
generations not a minor fact there's a
there's a the threat of nuclear war is
very serious
one of the things that's constrained it
is that there have been arms control
agreements like for example the Reagan
Gorbachev INF treaty which eliminated
the short-range nuclear weapons in
Europe extremely destabilizing okay
Trump tore it up and not only that
recently right after dismantling the
treaty last August immediately long
the test of the missile which violates
the tree just to plead with the Russians
that please develop weapons that destroy
us
how series is all of this I'll take a
look at what is probably the most
reasonable general assessment of world
affairs that we have the Doomsday Clock
of The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists as
I'm sure you know a couple of weeks ago
they gave their annual assessment and it
broke the record since 1947 they assess
the current situation as the most
dangerous in the world since the first
setting of the Doomsday Clock 100
seconds to midnight did any of this come
up in the hearings I mean here's a
person who is acting Oh virtually alone
in the world scene that was a wrecking
ball that's devastating the hopes for a
decent survival for human beings young
young people seem to understand this
very striking moment at the meeting of
people called the Masters of the
Universe the day votes meetings a couple
of weeks ago the first day was utterly
dramatic first the most powerful person
in the world gave a speech extolling his
own magnificence and saying on the side
we should not be alarmist about the
climate we should not be doomed to
theirs and so on well he's going on to
destroy and wrecking it in the lead in
the world and was followed by a 17 year
old girl Rosenberg who gave a quiet
factual lecture to the Associated great
men showing how a responsible animal
would act in the current world
astonishing spectacle quite different
from the impeachment proceedings which
were off on some side issues
where the outcome was certain and the
structures as far support from the
beginning well you just don't say that
kind of thing it's not proper but it's
significant I think that about the
difference between the Democrats and the
Republicans yes there are differences
the Republicans of both parties have
drifted to the right in the last 3040
years roughly the neoliberal period
today's where he called the
establishment kenner Democrats Clinton
style and Democrats they're basically
what used to be called moderate
Republicans the Republicans are just
gone off the spectrum
they're not acting like a parliamentary
party anymore I think this has been
pointed out by some of the political
analysts Norman Ornstein this man it's
cold among radical insurgency which is
abandoned parliamentary politics if you
look at International rankings of
parties from what's called left to right
mostly centered before right the
Republicans are ranked with the fringe
parties the parties with neo-fascist
roots in the international scene way off
to the right Democrats are ranked base
interest
well those differences may not confuse
but they are significant in a system
with extraordinary power small
differences can translate into huge
outcomes and again on the issues that I
mentioned the crucial issue is like and
for our mettle catastrophe nuclear war
there are differences significant ones
whatever you think about Obama and
Clinton they would never have been doing
what Trump has been doing to directly
hope for some kind of mitigation of lead
coming environmental catastrophe these
are not small point
these are existential issues there is a
little bit of a division among the left
in America and that division has to do
with the right process to reform our
government on one hand you have
individuals who believe that you can
really reform the Democratic Party from
within in order to create a party that's
much more representative of the
working-class and then on the other hand
you have individuals who think that the
establishment really needs a shake-up
you need to either create a third party
or just blow up the entire system and
start from scratch I wanted to get your
thoughts on that what is the most in
your mind I guess what is the best way
to move forward because I I certainly
fall into this category of leftists who
feel as though we don't really have a
party that represents our best interests
especially when you consider the
corruption that takes place the
legalized bribery that takes place in
this country a lot of the Democratic
donors have the you know same interests
that Republicans do and so the same
people are funding Democrats and
Republicans and they're essentially
pushing for very similar things in
domestic policy especially when it comes
to the financial sector so what is the
best way to move forward to kind of
change this system do you kind of start
from scratch or can you really reform it
from within
well you can't start the scratch that's
just not an option
mm-hmm that's suicide you have to deal
with the world as it exists not as you'd
like it to exist and I don't really I
think the two alternatives that you
sketch I should be regarded as
complimentary not competing we have a
short-term problem
what laser did you push on in November
of this year my simple question what do
is pick the one that's least damaging
okay after having spent five minutes
figuring that out you now go back to
work trying to develop the basis for a
much
substantial changes to develop popular
movements which will be active engaged
relations never stopping not restricting
themselves to the quadrennial
extravaganza but working all the time
on the ground the community's education
organizing activism to create the larger
scale changes that are needed but these
are not alternatives we shouldn't be
trapped by the basically they the
doctrinal system which I did which
identifies politics as showing up every
couple of years to push a button to
select one or another candidate picked
by the powerful yes that choice makes a
difference makes a significant
difference for reasons I mentioned but
once you've made that choice which would
take you a couple of minutes to figure
out you go back to the major work and
I've been no secret that the mainstream
establishment the Democratic
establishment the meeting
very concerned that Bernie Sanders might
gain the nomination we're doing
everything possible to undermine why I
don't think it's because of his policies
the fact of the matter is is its
policies are an expansion of the New
Deal
I don't think they would have surprised
an annoyed Eisenhower very much the last
conservative president that what really
is bothers him is he's breaking with the
condition that the public are supposed
to be occasional participants whose role
in the political system is to pick one
or another of the dominant class
he's breaking with that he organized the
mass popular movement inspired now doing
lots of things the he look back what's
called liberal democratic theory no time
to go into it they look back
it essentially asserts that the role of
the public is to be spectators not
participants that participation is
limited to being responsible member leox
guys the public just chooses among them
every once in a while that goes back to
its own business
well Sanders here at Corbin in England
are breaking with that and that's a real
threat to the establishment system so
naturally the bitterly opposed but
that's the right thing and that's not an
alternative to voting against Trump in
the next election that's something that
must be done if we hope at least is
leave some breathing space to achieve
the other Google's yes do that but it's
not the center of year I think that
you're absolutely right I think the
biggest threat that Bernie Sanders it
you know presents to our current
structure is that he doesn't just want
to redistribute wealth he wants to
redistribute power he wants to empower
the electorate to get involved and
demand more I mean that's the way that
America was able to have labor unions it
wasn't because they were gifted with
labor unions it's because workers fought
and demanded more and they they decided
to strike and there's a lot of power in
that and I think that Bernie Sanders
really does remind Americans that they
could have that power if they do
organize and they get active but since
we're speaking about Bernie Sanders I
have to follow up on something that you
had said in a previous interview you
were asked about the chances of Bernie
Sanders winning the Democratic
nomination and your view your outlook
was quite pessimistic so I just want to
show our audience what your answer was
and then follow up with you on what you
think today let's take a quick look if
he gets the nomination the attacks will
be wild
get the whole Republican propaganda
machine going after this Jewish atheist
you know it wants to kill avoids no
[Music]
chances he could be elected or pretty
small but if he does get elected miracle
he won't have Congress how you gonna win
Congress the Congress is that the u.s.
electoral system is structurally
constructed so that the reactionary
elements have an overwhelming advantage
so you describe the chances of Bernie
Sanders winning the election as a
miracle but if it does happen there are
structural issues in place that would
prevent him from carrying out his agenda
now this is an issue that's been brought
up by everyone regardless of political
ideology and so you know Bernie Sanders
is answer to that has always been well
it's about the people it's about
empowering the electorate so they demand
more so they fight they go to the states
where these members of Congress deny the
policies that they that the people want
and we can accomplish things if we
mobilize and organize now I have two
questions for you number one do you
still believe that it would be a miracle
for Bernie Sanders to get elected I
think miracle may be too strong but it
would be a very difficult test I mean
the the the liberal media attacks on
Sanders are already shocking as one of
the Washington Post just a couple days
ago that amazed me once the Republicans
get started leaving worse now it might
be with enough hospital there's another
part of that interview which you didn't
play which said that the great advantage
that Bernie Sanders has is that he does
have a popular base which he's inspired
which is active which was mobilized and
this goes back to your point a minute
ago about the great achievements of the
struggles in the labor movement
they were indeed significant it wouldn't
have been a new deal hadn't been for CIO
organizing sit-down strikes and so on
but that's one part of the story the
other part of the story was that there
was a moderately sympathetic
administration labor historian Eric
Loomis says who's written a lot about
very interestingly about strikes and
labor activism and their achievement it
points out that if you look at the whole
record the achievements of labor
struggles have always been in the case
when there was at least a mildly
sympathetic responsive power system then
they could achieve something otherwise
they're crushed so you need both it's
with Bernie Sanders in office there
would be a sympathetic administration
even if he didn't have Congress in his
hands and at that point if serious
popular struggles labor struggles and
women's struggles and others did develop
there would be a positive supportive
reaction and that amalgam can't lead to
change that that gets back to what we're
talking about before there is a decision
to be made on in November or in the
primary and the desync the decisions are
simple one shouldn't take a lot of
attentions and pretty obvious what it
should be so make it and then go back to
work developing lis the popular struggle
that will have to be the major part of
this everything's to make a change
as I understand Sanders he's pretty much
reasoning I think that one of the
biggest misconceptions is that if you
just elect the right President to
represent you that would lead to the
change that the people need but you need
that sympathetic person in the White
House and then that's when the struggle
really be
that's when you need to mobilize and get
politically active and demand more in
order to really change the system so it
benefits the working class as opposed to
those at the very top professor Chomsky
thank you so much for taking the time to
speak with me I wish you had more time I
could speak with you for hours about
this you're such a fascinating person
and I thank you for your contribution to
my education to journalism and more
importantly to the discourse in politics
thank you thank you very much thanks for
