well the notion of intellectual is a
very curious one to start with the term
was not really used in the contemporary
sense until by the time of the Dreyfus
trial when the Dreyfus Arts were cold
and in fact condemned as intellectuals
who bitterly condemned but because these
writers and artists dare to attack the
majesty of the state and its
institutions the Immortals of the
Academie Francaise bitterly denounced
them for this arrogance and so on and
the term came to be used for a curious
collection of people for one thing they
have a degree of privilege so if the
let's say there's an office with a
physicist who won the Nobel Prize
working on the latest efforts to find
dark matter and but doesn't express his
opinion other issues he's not called an
intellectual I suppose the janitor takes
care of his office happens that very
astute understanding and ideas about
international affairs and domestic
policy and discusses them when you asked
with him he's not good at electrical
they propose those who fit the category
have a degree of privilege and make use
of it to articulate opinions and
attitudes on issues of general public
concern it's roughly what's called
intellectuals very strange motion to
begin with and I'm getting back to your
question I don't think it changes much
what is the use of social media the
question is whether the content that
appears merits the dubious that you
being treated as an intellectual
