isn't it of a livelihood
I can't measure that because of the
movement being not I'd ever do curly or
scientifically-based it can be easily
influenced by corporate or state first
of all we have to I think we have to
recognize that there never have been
movements that were ideologically or
scientifically based they never existed
so the Marxist movements claimed to be
ideologically and scientifically based
but there was no science and there was
no ideology this was just a mask for
authoritarians so what was the science
or ideology in the Marxist movement for
example I don't think you can find it
you can find a lot of pretension and
there's a whole intellectual tradition
of trying to discuss the science and so
on but it's just not there and the
ideology basically was mostly kind of
follow me there's not much in the way of
ideology the contemporary movements I
think are much sounder in this respect
that much more resilient they don't have
false beliefs and non-existent
ideologies or fake science but they are
committed to you know they vary so much
you can't generalize about them but many
of them are committed to very serious
work on real issues does that make them
susceptible to control by a centralized
power yeah I mean centralized power is
not giving it up easily they're gonna
fight back by every means they have
there are many means the
marginalizing people through directing
them the consumption is a major means of
control and we shouldn't underestimate
how extreme it is so in the United
States is the most advanced country in
this respect because it's the most free
countries I mean it's a credit to the
American people that they're the most
propagandist the efforts that control
them are have to be much more extreme
because there's so few ways to coerce
people thanks to previous crimes but
advertising in the United States you
just you really have to I mean amazing
when you study how it works it's been
interested in it for example there's a
field of applied psychology academic
applied psychology in a major field of
academic applied psychology which is
concerned with nagging by children
translate that in the Hungarian when
children bother their parents to get
them to do something it's called nagging
and everybody who has taken care of
children knows about it there's a field
devoted to nagging and there's a logic
behind it the corporations had been
concerned for a long time about the fact
that there is a big part of the
population which couldn't purchase
things that doesn't have any money
children okay so there's a big mass of
people who are children who you could
somehow no coercion to buy advertising
into buying things so they don't have
any money so they can't do it well
breathing thought came to someone the
way to do it if you get them to nag
their parents so now they've discovered
you know
a dozen different kinds of nagging and
advertising for children is carefully
designed and control to elicit the kind
of nagging that might get the child to
buy get their parent to buy this
particular good and sorry they're not
called children they're called evolving
consumers so the question is how you get
evolving consumers to torture their
parents and to find something that just
to shut them up I mean I can see how it
works with my own grandchildren you know
they see something on television then
you know huge propaganda to make them
think they've got to have it is their
life comes to an end and if it turns out
that costs $800 not a second thought you
know what's money your parents
grandparents have infinite amounts of it
so they have to get that well you know
these are techniques of control and they
start from infancy I mean if you watch
you know sometimes watch television with
my grandchildren from infancy they are
deluge with propaganda which is aimed
making them perceive them their own
identity in terms of the number of goods
that they have there is nothing in your
life except with gluten see that
actually if you watch American
television programs these have a very
destructive effect in much of the world
especially in the third world but even
in Europe an American television
programs you know comedies and so on
they give a picture of life which is
designed of course to be like that it's
a picture of life in which nobody works
nobody has a job
nobody has problems the only kind of
credibility
you know nobody's poor everybody's got
everything you can imagine the only
problems you have or having a problem
with your girlfriend or something like
that that's life you know well you know
there are plenty of people who are
seduced by that vision of life and then
you get people all over the world who
say well you know I can't live like that
I have to work all these problems but
they're in that marvelous country they
don't have any of those things well you
know the relation to reality talking
about but it is a seductive picture and
it effects children it affects people
elsewhere in the world it's a technique
of control very carefully contrived I'm
a huge amount of effort goes into this
the art the popular movements subjected
to ensure they were I mean they're
subject to enormous propaganda to make
you feel that your own individual what I
call the rights which usually means
right to consumption is supreme and
nothing else exists I mean there are
plenty of people within the popular
movements who are caught up in the
efforts to destroy any social
organization within the society like
safe schools public schools are a social
commitment as public schools are based
on the idea of solidarity public schools
are based on the idea that you're
supposed to care whether some child
somewhere else can go to schools
well you haven't driven into your head
day after day the your own supposed to
care about yourself you know it's none
of your business if that kid across the
street doesn't go to school his problem
or parents problem but you have no
reason to pay taxes so that somebody
else can do something that's the
government stealing money from you you
know that's presented
as the government stealing your
hard-earned money to give away to
somebody and why should you agree to
that I mean the amount of propaganda
behind that is enormous and it affects
people all over the place and there are
other techniques of control so for
example since the 1960s
there's not a lot of concern about
controlling young people students
because of student activists well one of
the best ways to control people is to
drive them into debt so now it's
distinct from the 1960s but when a
student comes out of college she's often
deeply in debt at 20 Blair knows exactly
what he's doing when he's increasing
tuition demanding of tuition increase at
British universities
that's not for economic reasons you get
way more than that but making
corporations pay taxes instead of fleet
but it is a way of course and the
students I mean if students have to pay
Commission to get into school for one
thing that has the obvious class effect
where students but the other thing even
is even for those who get in they're
going to end up college with a big debt
burden I suppose you've graduated as a
lawyer let's say and you decide you want
to work on public interest law you know
our middle law or something but you come
out with a huge debt anyway to deal with
it just go to work for corporation and
become a corporate lawyer reason to get
trapped into that can't get away from
those are techniques of coercion that
constantly worked so sure you know
there's every everything from that you
know the Iraqis are going to come and
kill us is a way of course and people
and I mean in the United States for
example if you look at the economy of
the last 25 years just the internal
economy it's a very unusual period in
American economic history in fact you
mean it's the first time aside from
major depression that there has been
stagnant
real incomes so for about 90 percent of
the population in the United States and
this is pretty much true in England to
real incomes you know the amount of
actual money to buy things
it's either stagnant or declining about
90 percent also work hours are going up
so people workers much farther and
they're much more insecure that's a
crucial part of the economy is
consciousness is to make people insecure
there's a name for it in the economics
literature it's called a little
flexibility of labour and if you take an
economics course that gives you that's a
good thing
you should have flexible labor markets
the flexible labor markets is a phrase
that means when you go to sleep at night
you know if you have a job in the next
morning and that's good for the economy
because if you're insecure you're not
gonna try to get higher wages and you're
not gonna do any union and you're not
gonna do all those terrible things and
they're not gonna ask for benefits and
that's healthy for the economy and
there's a way to say it an academic
graduate school pros and there's a way
to say it in simple words but that's
what it comes down to well these are all
techniques of control our people subject
to them you can't help it will they
break up the social movements that
depends on the commitment of the people
are in meaning first of all you have to
become aware of all of these things
which is not so simple and then you have
to be willing to struggle against them
and to create alternatives you know but
that's what social struggle is about
