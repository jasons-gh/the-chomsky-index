Psychology?
Well...
Actually, I mean, you know, people differ, so you can't really generalize
But I think the general thing is something that we all know from our own experience
I mean, unless you're -- well, take your own personal experience
I mean, unless you happen to be an unusual kind of saint, maybe the first one since Jesus or something
Unless you're that kind of person, you've done some rotten things in your life.
Like maybe when you were eight years old -
you know - you took a toy from your younger brother because nobody was looking.
Well just go back to that circumstance, or something similar to it, and ask yourself honestly
Did you say
"I'm taking the toy from my little brother because I want it, and I'm bigger than he is, and nobody's looking so I'll take it" ?
Or did you say "look, it's really my toy, and besides, he had no right to it, and besides,
"I need it more than he does, and anyhow, it's better for everybody if I have it" ? You know
Well, like I say, unless you're a saint,
you took the second way out, and furthermore anybody in their lifetime has had a thousand experiences like that
Well, I think that's the way things work
You have some --
It's not that you --
You know --
I mean, belief formation is often contingent on the outcomes that you want
You know? You want a certain outcome, you construct the system of beliefs,
which makes that exactly right and just.
I suspect that that's the psychology in most of these cases
If you're an editor or a journalist or you know professor or something or other,
there are some things you want, like prestige and respectability and salary -
you know - invited to the right parties, and all that kind of thing,
and if you want to get that kind of stuff you have to
see things in certain ways.
Okay, so you start seeing things in those ways just like you did with your little brother. You know?
My guess is that's probably
overwhelmingly the psychology
I don't think many people are cynical enough to be just flat, outright liars,
saying "I'm gonna lie because that way they'll pay my salary"
That's, but you know, people differ, so your guess is as good as mine
I have nothing to say about this the only thing we know about these kinds of things are from
introspection you know and I suspect that what I'm describing is pretty close to universal.
I did take it away from my younger brother when nobody was looking
