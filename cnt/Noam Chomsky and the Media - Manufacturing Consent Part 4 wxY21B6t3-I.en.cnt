a year after I left his team are I was
appalled when I heard that Indonesia had
invaded that didn't want a small
independent country setting an example
for the region east timor was a
portuguese colony and Venetia had no
claim to it and in fact stated that they
had no claim to it during the period of
colonization there was a good deal of
politicization that different groups
developed a civil war broke out in
august 75
it ended up in a victory for Fretilin
which was one of the groupings described
as populist Catholic and the character
with some typical like the shredder II
Indonesia at once started intervening
what's the situation whether those ships
come in they start arriving scenes to
Monday 67 both together very close to
our border no they're not they're just
for fun in there preparing a massive
operation something happened here last
night that move this very deeply it was
so far outside our experience as
Australians that will find it very
difficult to convey to you but we'll try
sitting on woven mats under a thatched
roof in a hut with no walls we were the
target of a barrage of questioning from
men who know they've made I tomorrow and
cannot understand why the rest of the
world is not care that's all they want
for the United Nations to care about
what is happening here the emotion here
last night was so strong that we all
three of us we should be able to reach
out into the warm night here and touch
it Greg Shackleton at an unnamed village
which will remember forever in
portuguese timor
Ford and Kissinger visited Jakarta it
was december fifth we know that they had
requested that indonesia delay the
invasion until after they left because
would be too embarrassing and within
hours i think after they left the
invasion took place in December seventh
what happened on December seventh in
1975 it's just one of the great grey
evil deeds of history early in the
morning bombs begin dropping on dilly
the number of troops that invaded dilly
that day almost outnumbered the entire
population of the town and for two or
three weeks there was just they just
killed people yo no voy de fogo de
tomolo quiz me Logan Sean pues new new
song ESO sentido todo como sacar un
paseo marry me doofus presion foia snare
him Percy marry me he accompanied a
degree too great so just about in plum
is disposed on it yeah Clara in
Terryville discounts to must consider
internet regression against the mood as
the main issue of the discussion when
the Indonesians invaded the UN reacted
as it always does calling for sanctions
and condemnation and so on various water
down resolutions were passed but the US
was very clearly not going to allow
one
lightning
so the timorous were fleeing into the
jungles by the thousands by late 1977-78
Indonesia set up receiving centers for
those Tim Ruiz who came out of the
jungle waving white flags those the
Indonesians thought were more educated
or who were suspected of belonging to
Fred lien or other opposition parties
were immediately killed they took women
aside and threw them off to Delhi and
helicopters for use by the Indonesian
soldiers they killed children and babies
but in those days their main strategy
and their main weapon was starvation by
1978 it was approaching really genocide
all levels the church and other sources
estimated about 200,000 people killed
the us-backed it all the way the u.s.
provided ninety percent of the arms
right after the invasion arms shipments
were stepped up when the Indonesians
actually began to run out of arms in
1978 the Carter Administration moved in
and increased arms sales and other
Western countries did the same Canada
England Holland and everybody who can
make a buck was in there trying to make
sure they could kill more tea memories
there is no Western concern for issues
of aggression atrocities human rights
abuses and so on if there's a profit to
be made from nothing could show more get
more clearly than this case
it wasn't the puppy ever heard of his
team were crucial to remember that there
was plenty of coverage in the New York
Times and elsewhere before the invasion
the reason was that there was concern at
the time over the breakup of the
Portuguese Empire and what that would
mean there was a fear that belief
independence here in Russian influence
or whatever after the Indonesian is
invaded the coverage dropped I there was
some but it was strictly from the
quantity of the State Department and
Indonesian general never at themed areas
refugee
as the atrocities reached their maximum
peak in 1978 when it really was becoming
genocidal coverage dropped the zero in
the United States and Canada the two
countries have looked at closely
literally dropped the zero all this was
going on at exactly the same time as the
great protest of outrage over Cambodia
the level of atrocities was comparable
in relative terms of its probably
considerably higher and Timor
it turns out right in Cambodia in the
preceding years nineteen seventy through
1975 there was also a comparable
atrocity for which we were responsible
the major US attack against Cambodia I
started with the bombings of the early
1970s they reached a peak in 1933 and
they continued up till 1975 they were
directed against inner Cambodia very
little is known about because the media
wanted it to be secret they knew it was
going on they just didn't want to know
what was happening the CIA estimates
about 600,000 killed during that five
year period which is mostly either US
bombing or a us-sponsored war so that's
pretty significant killing but also the
conditions in which it left Cambodia
were such that high US officials
predicted that about a million people
would die in the aftermath just from
hunger and moseys because of the
wreckage of the country pretty good
evidence from US government sources and
Miss Powell resources that the intense
bombardment was a significant force may
be a critical force in building a
peasant support for the Khmer Rouge
before that were pretty marginal element
well that's just the wrong story after
1975 atrocities continued and that
became the right story because now
they're being carried out by the bad
guys well it was dead not in fact
current estimates are that well you know
they vary I'm in the CIA claim fifty to
a hundred thousand people killed and
maybe another million or so died one way
or another Michael Vickery is the one
person giving a really close detailed
analysis his figure is maybe 750,000
deaths above the normal others like Ben
Tiernan suggest higher figures but so
far without a detailed analysis anyway
it was terrible no doubt about it
although the atrocities the real
atrocities were bad enough they weren't
quite good enough for the purposes
needed within a few weeks after the
Khmer Rouge take over the New York Times
was already accusing them a genocide at
that point maybe a couple hundred or
maybe a few thousand people have been
killed and from then on it was a
drumbeat a chorus of genocide
the big bestseller on Cambodia papad is
called murder in a gentle land up until
April seventeenth 1975 was a gentle and
peaceful smiling people and after that's
a horrible Holocaust took place very
quickly a figure of two million killed
was hit upon in fact what was claimed
was that the Khmer Rouge boast of having
murdered two million people facts are
very dramatic in the case of atrocities
committed by the official enemy
extraordinary show of outrage
exaggeration no evidence required faked
photographs are fine anything goes also
vast amount of line I mean an amount of
lying that would have made Stalin friend
it was fraudulent and we know that it
was fraudulent by looking at the
response to comparable atrocities for
which the United States was responsible
early seventies Cambodia team are two
very closely paired examples well the
media response was quite dramatic
back in nineteen eighty I taught a
course at Tufts University well Chomsky
came around to this class he made a very
powerful case that the press underplayed
the fact that the Indonesian government
and next this former Portuguese colony
in 1975 and that if you compared for
example with Cambodia where there was a
courage of things that this was a
communist atrocity whereas the other was
not a communist atrocity well I got
quite interested in this and I went to
talk to the then deputy foreign editor
the times and I said you know we've had
very poor coverage on this and he said
you're absolutely right there are a
dozen atrocities around the world that
we don't cover this is one for various
reasons so I took it up I was working as
a reporter and writer for a small
alternative radio program in upstate New
York and we received audio tapes of
interviews with T Murray's leaders and
we were quite surprised at given level
of American involvement that there was
not more coverage indeed practically any
coverage of the large-scale Indonesian
killing in the mainstream American media
we formed a small group of people to try
to monitor the situation and see what we
could do over time we'll alert public
opinion to what was actually happening
in east timor there were literally about
half a dozen people who simply dedicated
themselves with great commitment to
getting the story to break through and i
reached a couple of people in Congress
they got to me for example i was able to
testify at the UN and write some things
they kept at it kept at a gift at it
whatever is known about the subject is
mainly comes from essentially comes from
their work was not much else all I wrote
first an editorial called an unjust war
in East Timor it had a map and its head
exactly what had happened we then ran a
dozen other editorials on it they were
red they were entered in the
Congressional Record and several
congressmen then took up the cause and
then something was done in Congress
out of it the fact that the editorial
page in the New York Times on Christmas
Eve published that editorial put our
work on a very different level and it
gave a great deal legitimacy to
something that we were trying to advance
for a long time and that was the idea
and the reality that a major tragedy was
unfolding in east timor if one takes
literally various theories that
professor Chomsky puts out one would
feel that there is a tacit conspiracy
between the establishment press and the
government in Washington to focus on
certain things and ignore certain things
so that if we broke the rules that we
would instantly get a reaction a sharp
reaction from the overlords in
Washington would say hey what are you
doing speaking up on East Timor we're
trying to keep that coin right near a
thing what we did here this was quite
interesting is that there was a guy
named Arnold cone and he became a
one-person lobby I appreciate the nice
things that call Meyer said about me in
his interview but I object to the notion
that a one-man lobby was formed or
anything like that I think that if there
weren't a large network composed of the
American Catholic Bishops Conference
composed of other church group composed
of human rights groups composed of
simply concerned citizens and others and
a network of concern within the news
media I think that would have been
impossible to do anything at all at any
time and it certainly would have been
impossible to sustain things for as long
as they've been sustained professor
Chomsky and a lot of people who engage
in this kind of press analysis have one
thing in common most of them have never
worked for a newspaper many of them know
very little about how newspapers work
when Chomsky came around he had with him
a file of all the coverage in New York
Times The Washington Post and other
papers of East Timor and he would go to
the meticulous degree that if for
example the London Times had
on East Timor and then it appeared in
The New York Times that if a paragraph
was cut out he compared and he say look
this key paragraph right near the end
which is really what tells the whole
story was left out of the New York Times
version of the London Times thing
there was a story in the London Times
which is pretty accurate the New York
Times revised it radically and just
leave tired they revised it and give it
a totally different cast
it was then picked up by newsweek giving
it the New York Times cast it ended up
being a whitewash whereas the original
was an atrocity story so I said to tujhe
Chomsky at the time I said well it may
be that you're misinterpreting ignorance
haste deadline pressure etc for some
kind of determined effort to suppress an
element of the story he said well if it
happened once or twice or three times I
might agree with you but if it happens a
dozen times mr. Meyer I think there's
something else at work and it's not a
matter of happening one time two times
five times 100 times happen all the time
I said professor Chomsky having been in
this business it happens at testing
times that these are very imperfect
institutions when they did give coverage
it was from the point of view of it was
it was a whitewash of the United States
now you know that's not an error that's
systematic consistent behavior in this
case without even any exception this is
a much more subtle process then then you
get in the in the kind of the
sledgehammer rhetoric of the people that
make a B equation between what the
government does what people think and
what newspapers say that that sometimes
what the times does can make enormous
difference at other times it has no
influence whatsoever so when one of the
greatest tragedies of our age is still
happening in these team where the
Indonesians have killed up to a third of
the population there in concentration
camps they conduct large-scale military
campaigns against the people who are
resisting campaigns with names like
operation eradicate
Operation Clean Sweep Tim Rees women are
subjected to a forced birth control
program in addition to bringing in a
constant stream of Indonesian setlist to
take over the land whenever people are
brave enough to take to the streets and
demonstrations or show the least sign of
resistance they just Massacre them it's
sort of like Indonesia if we allow them
to continue to stay and his team are the
international community they were simply
digest east timor and turn it into the
attorney trying to turn it into cash
crop I mean this is way beyond just
demonstrating the subservience of
immediate of power I'm they are actual
there they have real complicity in
genocide in this case the reason that
the atrocities can go on is because
nobody knows about them if anyone knew
about them there'd be protests and
pressure to it and stop them so
therefore by suppressing the facts the
media are making a major contribution to
some of some of the probably the worst
act of genocide since the Holocaust you
say that what the media do is to ignore
certain kinds of atrocities that are
committed by us and our friends and to
play up enormously atrocities that are
committed by them and our enemies and
you positive that there's a test of
integrity and more honesty which is to
have a kind of equality of treatment of
corpses relative principles I mean that
every dead person should be in principle
equals F with every other dead process
know what I said well I'm glad that's
not what you say because that's not what
you do of course it's not what I nor
would I say it that's right that in fact
I say the opposite what I say is that we
should be responsible for our own
actions primarily because your method is
not only to ignore a court the corpses
created by them but also to ignore the
corpses that are created by neither side
but which are irrelevant to your
ideological shadow they untrue but well
let me give you an example um that that
one of you are one of your own causes
that you take very seriously is the
cause of the Palestinians and a
Palestinian corpse where is very heavily
on your conscience and yet a Kurdish
corpse does not at all involved in
Kurdish support groups for years um eh
that's absolutely true SI playful so let
me just ask the curd
ask the people who are involved in I
mean you know they come to me I sign
their petitions and so on and so forth
and yet if you look at the stuff that
the things we've written it takes eight
let's take a look I mean I'm not amnesty
international I can't do everything I'm
a single unit hurt person but if you
read say take take a look say at the
book that Edward Herrmann and I wrote on
this topic in it we discuss three kinds
of atrocities what we called benign
blood baths which nobody cares about
constructive blood baths which are the
ones we like and the farias blood baths
which are the ones of the bad guys do
the principle that I think we ought to
follow is not the one that you stated
you know it's a very simple ethical
point you're responsible for the
predictable consequences of your actions
you're not responsible for the
predictable consequences of somebody
else's actions the most important thing
for me and for you is to think about the
consequences of your actions what can
you affect these are the things to keep
in mind these are not just academic
exercises we're not analyzing the media
on Mars or in the 18th century or
something like that we're dealing with
real human beings who are suffering and
dying and being tortured and starving
because of policies that we are involved
in we as citizens of democratic
societies are directly involved in and
are responsible for and what the media
are doing is ensuring that we do not act
on our responsibilities and that the
interests of power are served not the
needs of the suffering people and not
even the needs of the American people
who would be horrified if they realize
the blood that's dripping from their
hands because of the way they're
allowing themselves to be deluded and
manipulated by the system
what about the third world well despite
everything and it's pretty ugly and
awful these struggles are not over the
struggle for freedom and independence
never is completely over
their courage in fact is really
remarkable and amazing I've personally
had the privilege and it is a privilege
of witnessing it a few times in villages
in Southeast Asia and Central America
and recently in the occupied West Bank
and it is astonishing the sea
it's always amazing place to me it's
amazing I can't understand it it's also
very moving and very inspiring in fact
it's kind of all inspiring now they rely
very crucially on a very slim margin for
survival that's provided by dissidents
and turbulence within the Imperial
societies and how large that margin is
is for us to determine
today's on-the-spot assignment we're
going to see just what's behind the
making of movies the director and the
crew are shooting a documentary film
let's take a closer look Bob this word
documentary what would you say is the
difference between a documentary film
and a feature movie well they're good
many differences one would be length
generally speaking documentaries a good
deal shorter than feature films also
