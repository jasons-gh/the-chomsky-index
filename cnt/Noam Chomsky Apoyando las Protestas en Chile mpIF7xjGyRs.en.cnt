well the protests against the legacy of
the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile are
very inspiring and very appropriate the
neoliberal assault against much of the
population of the world pretty much
began in Chile that was one of the
opening shots and the legacy is severe
extended over much of the world the
United States as well and in leading the
protest against it
Chileans are providing a model that
others should support and pursue
themselves
