there's a standard way of privatizing
something like when Margaret Thatcher
wanted to privatize the British
railroads the technique was defund them
and then when they don't work people get
angry and say let's do something so you
hand it over to private enterprise which
totally ruins them and then the state
has to come back in because to try to
reconstruct it something it's known as
privatization the League and that's
exactly what's happening with Social
Security it's in good shape now when you
read in the newspapers as you do that
the big problem of the deficit is
entitlements and Social Security you
Medicare or Medicaid Social Security is
your problem for I think it doesn't add
anything to the deficit because people
pay for it and for another thing it's in
pretty good shape
certainly well and very the last of the
famous baby boomers will be gone before
there's any problem in it that's why
there's a big payroll tax increase
thirty years ago to ensure that but if
it's defunded it'll be a problem then
they'll be pressure to privatize it
that's a huge bonanza for the financial
institutions it will put trillions of
dollars into their hands which they can
then use to make a ton of money with
risky investments which are therefore
very profitable and when it tanks as it
will when the economy tanks you just
there's a technique you pick up your
copies of Milton Friedman and Hayek and
Ann Rand and you run to the nanny state
that you've nurtured you make sure that
they bail you out that's really existing
capitalism and it means that the scam
can go on like take privatizing schools
what's point of privatizing schools well
you know the idea is to instill in
people the idea that all you care about
is yourself so I don't happen to have
children of school age so therefore
according to
the ideology that's implanted in you
you're I'm not supposed to care whether
the kid down the street has school to go
to so I don't want to pay taxes and I
want to cut taxes because I don't care
if that kid goes to school and if you
know I have enough money I could send my
kid to private school if I wanted to so
cares of their public schools so we
should privatize schools to eliminate
the conception that we should care if
some other kid goes to school which
everybody has you got to drive it out of
their heads the same is true I don't
know if it's happening here of efforts
to privatize pension and security
systems at West Point of that like in
the u.s. these big effort to try to
privatize Social Security I mean not
financially speaking it's ridiculous
it's a huge cost and everything else but
there are reasons for Social Security is
based on an unacceptable principle
namely that each person that you should
care if the disabled widow
across town survives and you're not
supposed to care about that you're
supposed to care about whether you have
enough pairs of shoes and stuff like
them you know to enough cars and video
games or whatever it is that's all
you're supposed to care of it so you got
to privatize Social Security also
another advantage to privatizing Social
Security is that it has the brilliant
consequence of turning working people
against their own interests because if
your pension is tied up in stocks you
want to make sure those stocks go up and
the way those stocks go up is by cutting
wages and reducing working conditions
sending jobs to you know Chinese
sweatshops and so on so as a working
person you should you have to be
committed to undermining your own
interests and that's important so for
reasons like that you want to privatize
Social Security and privatize water or
schools and everything else by
definition privatization undercuts
democracy take something out of the
public arena and puts it into the hands
of unaccountable private tyrannies that
are created and supported by the state
which is what corporations are remember
all this privatization
you hear about it's supposed to be very
efficient and by some measure you know
by some ludicrous measure it probably is
efficient you know and they're part of
the reason why it's efficient is you
don't count the costs okay so like if
you suppose they're talking about
privatizing the MTA around you know the
public transportation thing all right
suppose you privatize the system you and
I know how to make it more efficient by
the economist measures you throw out
union workers and you get temps for half
the price and if there is an accident
because they never had any training well
it's just people are getting killed you
don't measure that and you cut off these
so-called unprofitable bus routes okay
or subway routes like you don't make a
lot of money at 11 p.m. okay so let's
throw them out well suppose somebody's
stuck somewhere at 11 p.m. and wants to
get home oh well you know it's
entrepreneurial values you know let them
hire a limousine or something you know
and in ways like that you can make the
system more efficient simply by
transferring the costs over the public
where you'll measure the costs okay so
it looks nice and efficient on some some
you know some economists a paper but of
course you just this huge costs
transferred over the public which you
don't measure
