laughing it's not even an option so for
example the whole business about
telecommunications including the 1966
Telecommunications Act and this latest
thing it's not even treated as a public
interest story it's a business story how
should the system be handed over to
private power not should it be handed
over to private power that's not even at
issue
just what modality should be used to
take these huge this huge public
giveaway and hand it over to private
power and notice there's a little more
than just giving the aircraft industry
away because this whole system is
crucial for the functioning of a
democratic system but virtually no
discussion the public is not supposed to
be involved in this that's true in
practice not just in this case but in
the whole background and it's even a
currency it's a principle you can read
about in standard texts on American
politics for example one that's written
by a couple of years ago by a guy with a
lovely title of professor of science of
Government at Harvard who explained that
the architects of power must create a
force that can be felt but not seen
power remains strong when it remains in
the dark exposed to sunlight it begins
to evaporate I think that statement is
very accurate
just like the statements by other
leading intellectuals and academics who
I quoted earlier and part of the task of
the institutions that are responsible
for the indoctrination of the young and
everyone else is to protect power from
exposure the Cold War provided a
framework for that but the issue is far
broader and it remains with us long
after the Berlin wall has actually
collapsed in the rules
you
the last teaching of the Vietnam War and
and we've been on a lot of platforms
separately since but nobody's ever dead
players together and but I say was the
last teaching of Vietnam what happened
at Brandeis and we were having a
teach-in to protest against American
military aid to the Saigon government it
was the end of April 1975 and as we were
sitting on a platform somebody a brand I
student came running down the aisle
holding a dispatch news dispatch in his
hand and said the Saigon government has
surrendered the war in Vietnam is over
that place exploded that was the last
teaching of the war so I'm hoping that
sometime in the course of the evening
somebody will come give us some real
give us some real good news
you know like every government in the
world has been overthrown the I think
it's useful to expand the definition of
sort of the Cold War from the
traditional one as no one was talking
about the traditional one has it
starting at the end of World War two and
and the United States confronting a
Soviet Union and and then follows a
whole series of interventions by well
the Soviet Union takes over Eastern
Europe the United States intervenes in a
lot of other places in the world and it
all ends happily in 1989 when as
everybody knows the Cold War is over
capitalism has triumphed and everybody's
happy I walk around looking for signs of
happiness it's over
but you look at the characteristics of
that Cold War the characteristics of the
United States being a military apparatus
military intervention repression at home
well you find that these characteristics
exist before 1945 well as no one was
saying you can extend the Cold War back
to 1917 to the you know American
military intervention and Siberia to try
to overthrow the new Bolshevik
government but if you look before 1917
before there was a Soviet Union right
and you find the United States
intervening again and again and again
right the United States intervening in
Cuba the United States taking over the
Philippines taking over Hawaii
intervening in Panama the Marines are
going into the Dominican Republic they
going into Haiti and all this before
1917 before there's a communist threat
and at the same time we're having
repression at home and before there's a
Bolshevik Revolution
the people were speaking out against
World War one in the United States are
arrested and put in jail all this before
there's a Soviet Union it suggests that
the there isn't that clear-cut sort
of beginning of that Cold War period and
quick our ending well certainly there's
1989 and American military intervention
and other parts of the world now that
there's no Soviet threat no more
military intervention well we soon have
several more you know and of course we
have the Gulf War no Soviet threat that
is all you can always find a good reason
for having a war you don't need the
Soviet Union it just helped a lot to
have the Soviet Union around during that
period it helped a lot for intervention
you could call anything a Soviet threat
right somebody takes somebody's elected
democratically in Guatemala in 1954
democratically elected that's what we
say we want no nothing not then no not
if you pick the wrong guy not you not
not if you people are elected somebody
who takes over you in the land of United
Fruit we can't have that United Fruit is
us and so we overthrow the government of
Guatemala
there's no it's not a communist threat
yeah Iran 1953 overthrow the government
of Iran no communist threat of course
there's oil you don't need the communist
threat if you have oil so so 1989
capitalism wins everything is fine is
everything fine democracy has come to
all the formerly a Soviet East Bloc
countries really oh they've had
elections in the Soviet Union they have
a two-party state three four five six at
the same time that we become a one-party
state
and here in the United States you know
can we talk about a triumph of
capitalism in the United States how
wonderful it is since the now that we
defeated the Soviet Union and and and we
know we don't have to worry about them
anymore everything is fine here the Dow
Jones average is way up that's terrific
tells us the Dow Jones average tells us
exactly how Americans are faring I mean
you know that you it must be a measure
of the economic prosperity of all
Americans because it's there on the news
every night you can't miss it and you
know if the Dow Jones average has gone
up we're obviously all doing better you
say you try it out you know next time
you're in a restaurant just say to the
waitress did you know that the Dow Jones
average has gone up 30 points she'll be
very happy to hear that you know I mean
why don't they put on TV how many people
are looking for work you know why don't
they put on TV statistics about how many
kids died yesterday before the age of 1
because they were sick because they
couldn't get medical care because they
didn't have enough to eat there are all
sorts of figures and statistics they can
put on television beside the Dow Jones
average to give us a picture of what
really is happening in this country I'm
suggesting that they that - that we need
to extend the this whole question you
know the Cold War from that period in
which the Soviet Union became the partly
the reason and partly the excuse you
know for what the United States was
doing before the Soviet Union arrived on
the scene and what the United States has
been doing since the Soviet Union left
the scene and that is there's a larger
and long continuum of struggle for peace
and justice in the world struggle for
change in the world struggle to
overthrow governments in the world
struggle to change the system here and
that go that went on before and that's
continuing to go on now and the
university is well that you there they
can't escape it and when you first enter
universities you think you're going to
escape it you think oh the university
the
you know it'll be nice there it's it's
it's not like the rest of the world you
know but it is it's just like the rest
of the world money power commerce greed
competition well it's part of the rest
of the world and who controls the
universities very often are the same
people who control the business
corporations right and how much
democracy is there in the university
wave universities are not democratic I
mean some universities even pride
themselves are not being democratic some
university presidents say
I I didn't mean to say that what
universities are supposed to you know
yes they're part part of the system and
then as no I'm saying they're they have
jobs their job is to indoctrinate their
job their job is to keep control the the
job is to turn people out you know
who'll take their obedient places in
society to do the jobs that need to be
done in society and not to make any
trouble really the problem is that
universities are also something else and
and that is they're places where people
read there are libraries and people have
a little more time to think and and and
a lot of young people in universities
and there's a certain idealism and young
people you know before they've been
captured by the real world I mean they
escaped from their parents they've not
been that yet been captured by the
business where I'll have a few moments
to think is saying so there are there
are great possibilities there
possibilities for yeah for trouble and
in in 1950 I was going to say I remember
in 1930 no I don't remember anything
about 1950 but 19 in 1950 the a
congressman from Illinois a herald of LD
of Illinois he was he was a former FBI
man perfect congressman of course and
soon to be a member of the House
Committee on un-american Activities and
and Velde got up in in Congress and
spoke out against a bill the bill was to
appropriate money for mobile libraries
to go through the rural areas so that
people in rural areas would have books
to read and fealty spoke up against him
saying education is the first step
towards communism
well I mean he was not quite right of
course
no because mostly education is not but
it has all sorts of dangerous
possibilities and at certain points in
history those possibilities become a
real I was teaching in the South in the
night and you know from 1956 to 1960
Street I was teaching it at a black
women's college in Atlanta Georgia and
and I could see when I got there in the
50s I'd seen my my students acting out
the role that college students in
colleges and universities were supposed
to play that as these these young black
women were there to learn well and to
take their place in the segregated
Society of the United States to become
the social workers and teachers and
maybe an occasional doctor and a lawyer
but yeah to take Barrow and they were
and they were trained that way and they
were supposed to be obedient and they
were regulated and controlled that way
and wins but then something happened and
as everybody knows and then suddenly
everything changed as some some people
stepped out first and then other people
stepped out and and and soon that that
that wall that was around our campus
would had been taken down and the
students were out in the in the street
and out demonstrating and out getting
arrested and and learning very important
and their education was beginning in a
real way I remember of colleague of mine
saying this is bad our students are
cutting my classes you know
they're ruining their education well if
what happened in the 60s of the students
who went out in the in the black
students who went out in the civil
rights movement and then in the anti-war
movement the students who got involved
in the anti-war movement they were
giving themselves a marvelous education
they were learning so much about the
world and if and when they went back to
the classroom they went back with a much
much greater curiosity about the world
much much wider understanding of what
they should look for and what books to
look for and what ideas to look for and
a much more critical understanding of
what was missing in the education that
they had gotten up to that point and I
saw that my students who went when they
came back from jail they were looking
for Du Bois and they were looking for
black history and they were looking for
things that didn't exist in their
education before no what happened in
those movements this and this is the
dangerous thing about education so you
know students who step outside the
classroom become dangerous students who
confront a real were students who learn
about government students who learn
about the police students who learned
that the things they that were taught to
them and in junior high school about how
the government works you know oh this is
democracy we have three branches of
government executive legislative
judicial we have checks and balances
great yeah and then they and and then
they walk out in one demonstration on
one peaceful picket line and the world
comes crashing down on them and they see
us education this is what they have
against the 60s you know does they have
something against the 60s you see all
sorts of things happen education changed
people be able to think in a different
way in a more critical way and and the
curriculum began to change the yeah well
we know that you know Black Studies and
feminist studies even gay Studies and
well what's the
as a result there's a lot of hysteria
around now among you know the people up
there out there I don't know where they
are exactly but you know they're the
they're emanations come to us from time
to time you know and and they're you
know they're wild you started without I
don't know if it started with Alan bloom
but he became you know the closing of
the American mind you know the 60s had
closed the American mind I don't know it
closed his mind you see because his mind
to what was going on but they were upset
that students were he was upset students
were leaving his seminar on Plato and
going out into the street to demonstrate
you say this is intolerable I'm so
lonely all is you know multicultural
education a terrible thought feminist
studies a terrible thought but what it
means is that yes the the movements had
an effect on the universities had an
effect on the curriculum had its effect
on the on the ideas of young people and
they didn't like that they've been
working to suppress that and working to
change that and working to regain
control really that's what's been
happening when they talk about doing
away with the Vietnam syndrome that
they're trying to do away with the
things that people learned in the 60s
about war about government about
education I mean the hope is that they
won't succeed that the record that the
history of those years will not be lost
that the exhilaration of those movements
will not be forgotten that education
will begin to to have the kind of
meaning that education always has when
people are engaged in social struggle
for justice and so there are things for
university students to do and college
students and community college students
and other people to do these days
obviously since the Cold War and in the
larger sense is not over there's a
struggle is not over
$250,000,000 military budget and then no
money for this and no money for that no
money for health and no money for women
and no money for children and no money
for this
there's just money for the military
budget as to these other people if too
many of them are going to be in trouble
and desperate and and hanging around the
streets and committing crime and taking
drugs well would you just build more
jails for them and that will take care
that's the situation with facing in that
situation it was a situation which calls
for a new social movement in this
country absolutely a situation in which
we need I mean there you have 12 people
who are ready to join it
but it's a good beginning say and yes
and a hope hope is that university
students can play a role in us and
things are happening all the time in
which people can take part somebody's
happening this Saturday with the
homeless in Boston some group right in
Boston meeting at Copley Square there's
a group that's organized to two to four
people to occupy people need homes to
occupy the fact thousands and thousands
of vacant places that exist they're
owned by the city they're not being used
while there are homeless people on the
streets there's all sorts of things
going all sorts of cultural things going
on that they're showing the movie Attica
you know not it's not necessary for the
population to believe that prisons are
the answer to to poverty and crime and
so on all sorts of things that are
happening out there which we can all be
a part of and so I hope you will thank
you
Howard just asked me to add a footnote
to his final comment and that is though
as we were walking in we got an
announcement that the Detroit I don't
have chance to read it yet so I'll just
read it off the put Detroit newspaper
strikers are in town or will be and
there's going to be an event four
o'clock on Thursday well that's talk but
at 9:00 a.m. Saturday February 22nd
there's going to be a rally at Sullivan
local 25 parking lot by yourself in
square and it's going to be a caravan
going to the Gannett plant in Norwood
this is part of a protest in support of
the Detroit newspaper strikers who've
been out for a long time
that's amounts to a lockout you can hear
more about it there
it was a question three
and thanks to the announcement known in
the light of that I was amazed to see
strikers members from the Detroit News
never surrender today this strength will
see to me because I had read in the New
York Times of course it's the absolute
truth and a very probably introduced
member that the strike was over I had
got a definite impression that this
strike was over all is not over and I
encourage you to to find out from the
workers from Detroit muscle just exactly
what's going on I'd also like to ask
people to take an interest in the case
of a young American woman who was a
student at MIT just a few years ago
who's 28 years old and has been in
prison for over a year now since the
life in prison by a secret military
tribunal it were accused of a variety of
different things depending on what time
the government was making the
accusations basically I had no
opportunity to defend herself and again
has been described in the New York Times
as now he admitted to being a member of
the MRT a this is not true in fact it
was a recent statement from him like the
official MRT a representative in Europe
for what that's worth that she was in no
way nobody know anything about this
whole thing
her name is Laurie Berenson and you can
write her in prison in what you can to
help you can find out more about it if
you have access to the World Wide Web
there is a page
information about her my question to
favor would be there are so many
different issues and I hope other people
will make announcements to bring forward
and other concerns but I guess does
either you would have any insight any
thought about how this very disparate an
energetic fragment series of
organizations and movements might come
together to be a more unified force in
this society could be encourage you to
use the mics it's mostly alternative
media it's whipped up there
you can always tell who wins now you
take the tough questions
I don't know well sure that's how big
you know you know that's a big problem
you have lots of things going on in the
country people in one party country
don't know it's happening in another
part of country an amazing number of
actions that take place all over this
country if you travel around the country
yeah no I'm doesn't he knows about these
if you travel around the country
it's amazing what is going on I mean I
mean you're in Duluth Minnesota and
you're the meeting of 300 people and
there are 16 tables in the back of the
room with 16 different organizations in
Duluth I'm not trying to put down Duluth
but yeah you don't expect it you see but
it's everywhere it's and and so probably
you know how House got this these gonna
be brought together I said yes
I don't know except that I think it will
take it will take a kind of
concentration on some central issue as
you know and during the civil rights
movement we have the central issue of
racial segregation and created a
national movement and during Vietnam we
have that that as a unifying issue which
brought all sorts of organizations
together and just seems to me if there
is any issue that can bring all the
different groups together it's the issue
of the rationale and just distribution
of the enormous wealth of the United
States you see it affects everybody it
affects the women's groups and the
environmental groups and the anti-war
groups affect everybody because
everybody you know the problems cannot
be solved without using the resources
that we have and they're available
I'm not this is my question any
particular person wants to take it
