PKK is the kurdish terrorists room and
they are actively in North Iraq and has
been supported by the USA no not the PKK
oh come on supply even though they had
their August you know the arms of the
unit after the Vietnam that they got and
then time two times in order by the
Israeli forces had been you know train
and turkey lost almost 15,000 more than
15 maybe 30,000 people that you know in
that area and still we were say
supporting and they can't do anything so
what do you think about that I think
that that's completely false I've been
closely involved in that for years and I
think I know the facts pretty well the
u.s. is not supporting the PKK it's
strongly opposed to it the Clinton
administration particularly poured arms
into Turkey to try to it to support
their counter insurgency operations
which were not just against the PKK they
carried out major atrocities all
throughout southeastern Turkey in the
Kurdish areas they destroyed according
to the Turkish government about 3,500
towns and villages wiped them out drove
out you know probably millions of people
I've been there and I've seen it and
I've also seen the slums in Istanbul
where the remnants try to survive they
it the number of people killed nobody
knows because we don't count our own
atrocities but according to Kurdish
sources it's on the order of 50,000
that's from the mayor of the Arabic your
usual numbers given a 30,000 so you know
massive atrocities as if you want to
read there's a lot of evidence about
this they're deep they haven't have a
very good human rights specialist
Jonathan sugden their analyst in
southeastern Turkey he has now been
kicked out by the Turkish government was
trying to investigate what's happening
but he has did compile very serious
detailed reports right through the 90s
imaginable kind of torture barbarism
destruction ecological devastation huge
ethnic cleansing you know one of the
major atrocities of the 1990s and so did
Amnesty International so of independent
reporters and others as in effect in
Turkey there are plenty of people know
about this have taken part in Istanbul
in protests by leading Turkish writers
academics artists journalists and others
who are courageously protesting against
these atrocities which is not easy in
Turkey you know it's not Turkish jails
are not much fun but they not only
protest against them but they're
constantly carrying out civil
disobedience against them I was able to
participate once and it's because they
know perfectly well what's happening
furthermore they want it publicized so
when I was visiting Turkey actually to
take part in a trial of a publisher who
was being sent to jail because he
published a few remarks of mine about it
I was just invited all over the place by
Turkish television because they wanted
it said and they can't say it so it was
all over the papers and television and
so on I was in fact often given a award
by the Turkish Publishers Association
not because I did anything particularly
remarkable but just because i was saying
what they knew and can't say the as the
atrocities escalated through the 90s aid
from the Clinton administration
increased by 19 and the year single year
1997 one year Clinton provided more arms
to the Turkish military than the entire
Cold War period combined up to the onset
of the counter insurgency well took a
lot of discipline here in the United
States for the press to shut up about
this I mean here they're talking about
you know terrible atrocities going on in
the Balkans by these bed Serbs and
others meanwhile write on the board how
can we stand it if right on the borders
of NATO some terrible thing is happening
try to find an article which said right
within the borders of NATO you
worse things are happening and you're
paying for it not just the United States
Germany involved written than others but
primarily the Clinton administration
that's what was going on there a u.s.
certainly wasn't supporting the PKK I
think you're probably confusing that
with us support for also the Israelis
for the northern Iraqi Kurds who are
strongly against the PKK and that's for
ugly geopolitical reasons my guess is
sooner or later they're going to be sold
out to as they have been in the past
remember the u.s. supported them in the
70s then decided it's better to support
the Shah and sold them out and they got
massacred by Saddam that's when the
Henry Kissinger made his famous
statement about how you shouldn't
confuse foreign politics with missionary
work so yeah we sold a mountain they get
massacred by our friends at UM who cares
and they're gonna you know I think
they're playing with fire when they rely
on us support and it's very likely
almost certain that Israel is up there
in the Kurdish areas because that's a
kind of a natural alliance for them for
both of them so that's happening but
that's not the PKK now it is true that
the PKK is in northern Iraq they are
there the serious journalists who are up
there like Kevin mckiernan I'd have been
there for years report that there are
PKK bases in northern Iraq and the
regions that are regarded as the Kurdish
homeland you know up in the mountains
there there McKiernan reports that he's
been there for years that they just move
in and out with everybody else because
they're more or less accepted by the
Kurdish society is part of them so they
come down from their mountain
strongholds and go into the towns and so
on so yeah they're there and the current
up and I kick them out but that doesn't
snot to say that the u.s. supports them
it was certainly hasn't in Israel
certainly hasn't Israel's had a long
close intimate relation with Turkey
since nineteen fifty-eight that's in
fact Israel second closest Alliance
after the United States and it's for
good reasons these are two
of the states that are on the periphery
of the oil-producing region along with
the Shah of Iran they were what the
Nixon administration called the cops on
the beat local cops on the beat which
control which defend the tyrants who run
the oil production they defend them from
their own populations the kind of local
is on the arms and in that context yes
there's a close Israeli Turkish alliance
and it remains that things have changed
in many respects but not in that respect
so they're the local cops on the beat
police headquarters is in Washington is
a branch office in London that's roughly
the way the system is run and turkeys
been a big part of it in alliance with
Israel and of course the United States
so I just don't agree with the facts I
think they're the opposite and I think
they're quite ugly so Chomsky my name's
I shanzie my work with the BBC World
Service right here and I want to know
what do how do you see Bush
administration's latest nuclear deal
with India their plans to supply nuclear
technology and fuel to India I think the
several questions like is it right or
wrong but I think the purpose is pretty
clear you know we have to speculate
about government policies we're not
sitting there you know internally and
listening the conversations but from all
the evidence available I think it's
bush's trip to India trying to you know
that when which you did authorize the
nuclear weapons is part of the jockeying
about where India is going to go India
has a major decision to make right now
as to whether it's going to become a
what's called an ally meaning kind of a
client state of the United States or
whether it's going to join the emerging
Asian system and that's an extremely
serious geopolitical issue Asia is
developing it's mostly china-based but
in its got huge resources Russia's got
plenty of resources
South Korea's third biggest industrial
economy in the world I think are very
high up China has just surpassed Japan
as the major holder of foreign reserves
at the end between them they hold I
think over half of global foreign
reserves Chinese rate of growth is very
fast at the if you use the right
measures purchasing power parity China
already has an economy about two-thirds
the size of the United States and within
about 10 years at current rates of
growth it will be comparable to it that
whole region is the most dynamic
economic region in the world they are
moving mainly china-based to create an
inter and Asia wide security system that
includes energy resources pipelines you
know development of resources and so on
there's an asian energy security grid
and there's the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization which is kind of paired
with it more or less they are bringing
in other countries shanghai cooperation
organization just brought in india iran
pakistan and afghanistan i think as
observers and pretty soon they'll be
admitted iran made give up on Europe may
decide that Europe is too easily
intimidated by the United States to deal
with which may be correct and turn to
the east these still be very happy to
accept them
