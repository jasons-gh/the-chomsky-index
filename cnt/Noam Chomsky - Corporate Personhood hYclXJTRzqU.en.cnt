professor Chomsky I traveled from
Jackson Michigan to hear you speak
tonight and it's an honor to be able to
ask you a question
thank you in Chris Hedges book the death
of the liberal class you're quoting is
you're quoted as saying there's a
substantial shift in global power
quoting from the global workforce to
transnational capital and it's been
sharply escalating during the neoliberal
years
my question is how significant do you
think a constitutional amendment to
repeal corporate personhood to define
persons as natural persons only would be
in slowing down or hopefully even
reversing the shift in power well you
know the corporate personhood is a real
scandal a corporate person whose
interesting doctrine a minute yeah it
goes back to the 14th amendment which is
very sorry to bring up too much history
but this stuff is really enlightening
you go back to the 14th amendment right
if the Civil War its core principle is
that no person can be deprived of Rights
and without due process of law actually
there's something like that in the fifth
amendment but this expanded it and the
intention of course was freed slaves
event freed slaves cannot be deprived of
their rights well it was never applied
to freed slaves almost entirely it was
applied to corporations they're not to
be deprived of their rights without due
process of law over the years the
concept of corporate personhood became
elaborated it wasn't really established
firmly until about a century ago and it
was not done by legislation
it was courts and lawyers and
incidentally progressives were behind it
the progressives strongly supported it
but part of their support for were
called organic institutions over more
important than individual
so we roll Wilson and the rest but what
it means is that the the meaning of the
14th amendment was expanded so that
person included corporations and over
the years corporations have gotten
rights that are way beyond those of
persons of flesh and blood so if you go
say to Clinton's
free trading or so-called free trade
agreement with Mexico's and now you do
with free trade it's what's called it
grants corporations rights that human
beings came dream of like for example of
General Motors invests in Mexico they
have to be given national treatment
meaning treated like a Mexican business
it's one of the ways to make sure that
Mexican business is destroyed and you
get big immigration here incidentally a
Clinton administration understood that
they knew they were going to wipe out
the agricultural system and business in
Mexico and in fact in 1994 when NAFTA
was passed Clinton started militarizing
the border it had been an open border
before but they started militarizing it
for obvious reasons well that's the
expansion of course if a Mexican human
being appears in New York and demands
national treatment wants to talk about
it but but corporation said these are
among the rights that go way beyond
persons at the same time the Fourteenth
Amendment was restricted this concept
that no person can be deprived of rights
if you take it common sense
interpretation it means that an
undocumented alien can't be deprived of
Rights well we can't have that so the
courts and their wisdom over the years
have defined person so it doesn't
include creatures of flesh and blood and
who don't have the right documents ok so
it's both the concepts both and expanded
and restricted
and that proceeds without any complaint
from the original ists and so on and so
forth well what about something added to
that what was added to that was in a
Supreme Court case in the in the
seventies which determined that money is
speech okay so money is a form of speech
all of this stuff is instantly supported
by the ACLU and others I shouldn't say
this free speech ad that can support
this and what would it mean you combine
all of this you get the Citizens United
you're through ago which says that you
can't infringe on the right of these
persons like say General Electric to
speak freely by spending as much money
as they want to buy an election I mean
that's the conclusion it was quite
interesting to read the reasoning so
Justice Kennedy is the swing vote in
Citizens United his argument was well
look we give other corporations the
right of freedom of speech like the CBS
or the New York Times so why should we
deny it to say General Electric and
Citigroup it's an interesting concept
that means of course the reason why CBS
to the New York Times were granted these
rights is because they're supposed to
fulfill a public trust you know they're
supposed to provide honest objective
informed analysis I won't talk about how
it's done but that's the reason why they
get this right but that's gone you know
if Kennedy's swing argument just
dismissed that if they get the right I
shouldn't General Electric get it so
citizens is that here you get a really
serious blow at the foundations of
democracy and that's part of the reason
why election costs are sure already
ridiculous are going to the sky so what
about a constitutional amendment what
was the problem with that the
constitutional amendment requires public
support substantial public support and
that doesn't come by
you know going like that you got to work
on it so there has to be a lot of
organizing and educational work to build
a major ground swell of support which
will call for restoring the 14th
amendment to what the words say you know
I should say that back a century ago
when corporate personhood was being
established by courts and lawyers there
was a lot of objection to it and the
objection came from conservatives the
term conservative still exists but not
the category back in those days
conservatives classical liberals were
people who believed in classical liberal
doctrines now people talk about them but
they don't believe in them and the idea
that a corporation should be given
personal rights is a major attack on
classical liberal doctrines which held
that rights in here in persons persons
of flesh and blood and that collectivist
legal entities established by state
power but nowadays what are called
conservatives have you know shifted now
they're called libertarians and why has
nothing to do with that so there is a
conservative objection to it and I think
there's plenty of anti corporate feeling
in the country but it's unfocused it's
confused like almost everything at a
very atomized Society so yeah a
constitutional amendment would be a
great idea I think or maybe just
legislation but it takes worked an
enormous amount of work to build up the
popular support for it
