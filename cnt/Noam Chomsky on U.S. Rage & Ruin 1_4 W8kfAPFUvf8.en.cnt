from WBUR Boston I'm Tom Ashbrook and
this is on point the name alone Noam
Chomsky draws a line through almost any
crowd if you're with him you're ready to
shake the system to question just about
every mainstream assumption on politics
power the economy funny thing is it's
Tea Partiers shaking the system right
now and Chomsky Lord to the left is both
sympathetic and afraid these are serious
times this our on point the conversation
with Noam Chomsky on America and the
world you can join the conversation
what's your question today for Noam
Chomsky is he your go-to theorist your
bete noire even if you don't agree with
him do you respect him his life's work
you can also comment at our website
OnPoint radio org or on Twitter and
Facebook at OnPoint radio joining me now
in the studio is Noam Chomsky legendary
intellectual and social critic professor
emeritus of linguistics at MIT his
latest book is hopes and prospects of
the big works include manufacturing
consent failed States and hegemony or
survival Noam Chomsky welcome back to on
point glad to be with you again
yeah it's several years not 2006 since
you last sat in that chair my oh my how
much has happened in that time and just
in the last couple of years a year and
some the Tea Party share your thoughts
about it I'm looking here you were in
Madison Wisconsin talking about the Tea
Party what it represents and I found it
a very interesting and I get this is
just a couple of months a few months ago
a very interesting combination of things
on the one hand you are saying don't
take this lightly give this what upset
the respect it deserves but also you
express real fear even fear of fascism
here well I think we first of all should
make a distinction between and I tried
to do it in that talk between the tea
party itself movement in quotes
not much of a movement but
participants and philosophy members it's
a relatively small group moderately
affluent not represented not very
representative of the country highly
funded so very prominent and given
enormous media attention so that's one
segment the other and I think more
significant group is those maybe half
the population who pretty much resonates
to what they take to be their message
that is a party message that what they
take to be and I think they're
misunderstanding it but there's
considerable resonance in the country
shows up in polls and so on and that's
segments a half the population really is
representative of a lot of the country
those are people with real grievances
they a lot of them are working class
lower middle class for about 30 years
they have seen their incomes pretty much
stagnate working hours going way up far
behind Europe above Europe benefits
which were always fairly weak here
declining they just went through a
shattering catastrophe with an 8
trillion dollar housing bubble burst
that for many of them was most of their
assets and they're facing unemployment
is way up some of them may look say
manufacturing in history course really
the core of an economy is just
collapsing I mean manufacturing
unemployment in manufacturing is
literally is at depression levels and
furthermore there isn't much prospect of
those jobs coming back and they see
these people see that this tremendous
wealth in the country but very highly
concentrated inequality has soared to
maybe the highest level ever
headlines today highest level ever
record gap between rich and rich and
poor this mortal you can see it I mean
and it's a very small part of the
population
which is accumulating the the wealth
that has been produced in the last 30
years well for most of the population
it's no it's not third-world poverty but
it's not what they have a right to
expect and it leads to a lot of
bitterness they'd like answers and
they're not getting any answers you say
half the country then maybe resonating
to what they take the tea party message
to be what do you think they're hearing
whatever you think the message may
actually be at its heart we'll look at
that but what do you think they're
hearing that they're resonating with
from the tea party movement what they're
hearing is everything every institution
is rotten the government doesn't do
anything for us the corporation's doing
it don't the parties aren't doing
anything actually antagonism toward the
Republican Party is even higher than
towards the Democrats then they want you
know Congress should be thrown out and
started over again you know they have
resentment against professions they
don't believe scientists everything
isn't working that's what they hear from
the Tea Party movement they don't hear
anything constructive but it does and
the trouble is they're not hearing
anything constructive from anyone else
so the Democrats are not telling them
look we understand your problem and it's
because of the financialization of the
economy which we support it and we
create Wall Street centric and so nobody
I can tell them that the Republicans are
by now the Republicans are barely a
political party in the traditional sense
and some of what's coming along there is
is really frightening but the tea party
message of against you know against
power against institutions and so on
that's about the only message they're
hearing I was struck in your comments
there in Madison as the report anyway
you're saying now look people and maybe
you're talking to American liberals here
if you look at at the Tea Party what was
circle of resonance and say what a bunch
of Yahoo's you know how ridiculous how
how nutty you're making a big mistake
it is because we should I mean you can
say that about share an angle if you
like area reads about oh yeah but the
real question is who's responding in
whatever way they are to those kind of
cry what about the cries for help and
those people should not be ridiculed
they should be organized they should be
the kind of people Oh in the 1930s act
under somewhat similar conditions
reacted in a very constructive way and
compelled the government to institute
the New Deal measures which you know
we're not superb but they did save the
country from a very serious crisis
you're 81 now you're old enough to have
a kind of memory of that that time and
yet I hear you I read you saying that
you've never seen anger and fear in this
country of the type that you see now
there was a lot of fear in the 1930s
there was certainly anger swirling
around what's what's different now in
this country
well my I was a child I know it's
childish but my family was working class
at that time unemployed New York the
things objectively they were much poorer
than working people flat-screen TVs but
you know but on the other hand it was a
kind of a hopeful period it wasn't you
didn't sense least I don't remember
sensing the kind of despair that you see
now the kind of anger you may found it
somewhere like John Steinbeck's Grapes
of Wrath and so on but among the urban
working class large part of the
population it my impression is that
there was hopefulness we can do
something
the CIO was organizing there's latterly
sure the labor movement we can get the
witches of you know the labor move is
more than just let's have jobs it's an
educational process so for example of my
unemployed seamstress ants
got a week in the country from the union
education and social circles it's social
circles educational circles workers
education that was a remarkably high
cultural level in fact but a sense that
there's something we can do you know
it's going to get better and now now
there's a sense of real despair and
anger nothing's going to work
nothing no hope for the future we just
have to get rid of everything but not
replace it by anything you say respect
the despair of people who are feeling it
now you say respect it and do something
about it but you also point to it with
that with a very significant element of
fear you've seen how this that kind of
despair can go in other times in other
places well and in that talk actually I
did mention an analogy of one that I
don't think we should take too seriously
but we should also not overlook the
analogy is the obvious one Germany in
the 1920s and early 30s and we should
remember that Germany in the 1920s Haim
our Germany though that was actually the
peak of Western civilization in the
sciences the arts was a model of
democracy a huge labor movement a lot of
political activism but within a few in
1928 the Nazis there was an election the
Nazis had a few percent of the vote in
1933 they were so powerful that the
Hindenburg president was compelled to
elect select Hitler as Chancellor he
hated him he had contempt for him class
contempt and everything else but there
was just too much popular support well
within 10 years Germany went from the
peak of Western civilization to the
depths of barbarism maybe in modern
history and and the the fundamental
reason is that the center collapsed
people lost any respect many people for
the major political parties that had
covered the third rack the they couldn't
stand that bickering and Parliament they
felt that Germany was being badly
treated the you know we loved the
national pride I mean the Depression hit
but it was happening before they and
what happened is a charismatic figure
arose and succeeded in mobilizing masses
of the population with consequences that
we know and in fact I'm old enough to
remember that too
I'm Tom Ashbrook this is on point we're
talking this hour with legend of the
left Noam Chomsky about his big take on
our moment President Obama economic
crisis tea party war you were just
saying we're looking back to German
history though our Republic ultimately
the rise of Hitler that charismatic
figure you've said that we've been lucky
so far about the charismatic figures who
haven't have not risen in this country
what do you mean I felt that all my life
if if you take a look at the culture of
the society which was just pretty
unusual it's different from others in
many respects and there is a lot of
anger and it's been a very frightened
country since colonial days in fact you
could see the literature and culture and
so on we're very lucky that no honest
charismatic figure has arisen honest
well everyone who arose was a thug and
corrupt of Joe McCarthy religious
leaders others they Nixon you know so
corrupt that they couldn't mobilize the
population they collapsed if we got an
honest charismatic figure like Hitler
you know he wasn't corrupt he was honest
he was a monster but he had a message
which the popular which meant something
to the population and by 1939 the
estimates are that about 90 percent of
Germans supported him what about the
charismatic figures then on our horizon
right now I mean there's you'd have to
say this led Beck we saw the big rally
in Washington there's I don't know in
radioland is rush limbaugh maybe there's
Sarah Palin there's there's President
Barack Obama talk about charisma he had
it in spades in his in his presidential
campaign Barack Obama's frankly never
liked it much from the beginning it was
but he a lot of Americans did they put
him right in the White House they liked
the aura it's you probably know that
Obama won the award from the advertising
industry in 2008
for the best marketing campaign of the
year and executives in the industry
we're euphoric they said they've he's
going to change the tone they in fact
what they said is we've been marketing
candidates kind of like commodities ever
since Reagan and this is our greatest
achievement ever it's gonna change the
atmosphere in corporate boardrooms and
so on but that's paper-thin and as soon
as the pleasant rhetoric was not
realized in action or was realized in
action and ways that harm people it
began to decline whole chars an aside
for just a moment if you would what
about on the right charismatic figures
there today well you know they're there
but and actually I spent a lot of time
what I'm driving I listen to talk radio
you get a interesting sense of part of
the public and not so much for the radio
hosts but the caller the callers give
you an interesting feeling about some
segments of the population but you know
it's just hard to take those people
seriously I mean yes they're there but
they're not going back isn't going to
organize a popular movement he's not
going to
