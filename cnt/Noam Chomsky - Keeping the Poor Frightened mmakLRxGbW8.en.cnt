I my question has to do with the
category of globalization and worker
fear as you mentioned in your speech
your thoughts on the offshoring of
Technology jobs and also the h-1b visas
1.3 million in the last three years that
have displaced technology workers here
in the US including me hmm well actually
there's an interesting op-ed in The New
York Times about this this morning by a
good econ a very good economist Jagdish
Bhagwati who's also a not only a fine
economist but or a decent person that
really wants to help the poor and
important things and what he's saying is
that people who are objecting to
outsourcing just don't have their
economics straight if they understood
economics they would know it's a good
thing and why is it a good thing well
because it increases efficiency and
efficiency increases the economic pie
and that's good for all of us and if you
don't allow corporations to outsource
they may die and then they won't be any
jobs for anyone and so on well and then
he says we have a very innovative
society so we should be able to develop
means of overcoming this well everything
he says is true in some abstract model
of the International economy which has
actually no resemblance to reality but
in that model it's true and you can
probably prove a theorem about it in the
actual economy it's very innovative but
not because of private enterprise
it's a innovative yes because of massive
state intervention exactly what's
blocked but for everyone else by the
so-called globalization rules so we're
going to do it because we do anything we
like but others can't do it furthermore
that's the whole history of
the modern world that's why India
India's it was a disaster and Britain
became rich it's because of those
relationships and so it goes so in the
real world yes we're innovative but not
for his reasons furthermore even on his
own terms objecting to suppose at this
but let's take this abstract model that
he's talking about suppose that
corporations die in the United States
well just means they're inefficient so
that means that he and I and you can all
get kicked out of our institutions
because they're just not competitive and
we can apply for jobs as janitors that
you know 80 hours a week no pay or you
know get locked into factories and so on
by factories on in more efficient places
like Thailand and China and so on maybe
that will increase the economic pie you
know so why not advocate that I mean you
know who cares if the corporation's your
died for them where the outsourcing has
nothing to do with economic efficiency
outsourcing is one of the operations
that take place within command economies
the country the economy is run by a
network of command economies called
corporations I mean what goes on
internal to a corporation or a mega
corporation is not free trade it's
command economy but corporations the
totalitarian institution you know has a
board of directors the top of manager
gives orders it once follows them down
to bottom the very bottom if you're
lucky you can rent yourself to it and
get a job and if you're sufficiently
propagandize you may even buy some of
the junk they produce and so on but it's
certainly not has nothing to do with
what you know any classical economists
would have called a free-market
outsourcing is just part of the
technique outsourcing is internal to the
corporation right the corporation picks
some supplier to outsource to
and keeps them under control because
then they can get much cheaper labor
hideous working conditions don't worry
about environmental controls they get
inputs to themselves which are very
cheap that increase for those of you
have studied economics you know that
that increases productivity if you get
artificially chief inputs that increases
productivity because productivity is
measured in terms of you know value
produced divided by the number of
workers so you get a nice measures of
productivity which have nothing to do
with productivity they just have to do
with the fact that you've got the 20
year old women off the farms and China
locked in the factories and working
until they die in a couple of years that
very healthy for the economy but it's
all internal to big command economies
that's one of the reasons why the
concept trade is so ridiculous I mean
what's called trade would certainly not
have been called trade by Adam Smith
like you know that outsourcing happens
to send goods across the border into the
United States but it's under the control
of a command economy in fact a network
of command economies which work the way
it is quoted you know the oligopolistic
competition and strategic integration
and the same is true of most of what's
called trade and we don't have nobody
really studies this much so you don't
have really accurate numbers but if you
take the numbers that are guessed at by
economists would look at it takes a
NAFTA one of the great things about
NAFTA is supposed to have been that it
increased trade between the u.s. and
Mexico
well it certainly increased cross-border
transfers of material objects but is
that trade well it depends no it turns
out that the percentage of interaction
that's intra firm internal to a command
economy went from about 50 percent
before
to about two-thirds after NAFTA that's
not trade any more than if GM shift
something from Indiana to Illinois you
know happens across an international
border so that you can take advantage of
rotten working conditions and the low
wages and no environmental constraints
but no more trade than if the Kremlin
moved something from you know Poland
Hungary or something like that it's and
in fact it's very possible if anybody
ever bothered the study it that actual
trade is even declined since NAFTA I
mean nobody studies it because it's the
wrong questions to ask you no need for a
ideological framework that we're
supposed to accept but if you did ask it
you might very well find that just as it
turns out after NAFTA that you know
another great thing about NAFTA for
Mexico is that foreign investment shot
up which it did but a little footnote is
the total investment decline because
Mexican investment declined even faster
than foreign investment went up for the
simple reason that Mexican businesses
can't compete with highly subsidized US
corporate the system yeah so when you go
back to the outsourcing story it's just
you know in an abstract world what he's
describing is true in the real world
it just doesn't anything do with what's
going on should we approve of it well
you know that's not the only question
there are other options for example
another option is to work to improve
working conditions labor standards
environmental conditions and so on in
the places to which they are outsourcing
okay that will tend to equalize the
conditions is that a utopian measure not
at all it's been used they they look at
the European Union before the European
Union integrated efforts substantial
efforts were made and substantial costs
were assumed to raise the level of the
our countries Portugal Spain and Greece
to raise Labor Standards raise wages
improve conditions enough then get to
the northern standards but enough so
that when they finally integrated there
wasn't a very severe blow against the
wages and living standards of northern
workers well that's because they have a
kind of social market economy in a more
or less functioning democratic system
and the same could have been done with
regard to NAFTA in fact it was proposed
by the US labor movement but never
entered the discussion and the same
because corporate media against it and
the elites are against it but and the
same could be true of the whole
outsourcing story so there are other
options it's not either let the command
economies maximize their own profit and
power or else you know you know the job
there are there other options
