hello I am your host Colonel Hakim and
you are watching the Arabic hour
on April 3rd the american-arab
anti-discrimination committee presented
a conference with Professor Noam Chomsky
and Ahmedabad Dodd
the lecture focused on presidential
elections chirp surges in Iraq and
current US policy towards the Middle
East last week we brought you the first
part of the conference with Professor
Noam Chomsky speaking on the u.s.
foreign policy in the Middle East on
today's program we will be bringing you
the second part a mini debate between
Professor Chomsky and our mudbud thud
the executive director of the ADC MA
there many debate was perspectives on
the Israel lobby without further delay
let us now go to Boston University with
Professor Noam Chomsky and Ahmadabad
um let me first start by saying that it
was exposure to Professor Chomsky's
analysis roughly roughly nine years ago
at age 17 that sort of got me to begin
to think critically about world affairs
so I have tremendous respect and
admiration for him and I'm actually
honored to be sharing a panel with him I
am got a message recently from a student
at Brandeis University somebody who
clearly knows nothing about either my
views or professor Chomsky's views about
the Israel lobby and basically he was
outraged at the thought that I would be
debating professor Chomsky saying a
debate is supposed to be between people
who disagree with each other and here
you have professor Chomsky debating some
guy from an Arab organization yeah right
some debate which I guess is a really
good point given the fact that there is
a monolithic view that all Arabs
subscribed to at birth or something
which apparently professor Chomsky
happened to get in the wrong line at
that subscription process or something I
you know but people who actually
understand the israeli-palestinian
conflict and who share a critique of US
policy towards it there is a a debate
over what actually drives that policy on
one end of the spectrum you have people
like professors mayor Oswalt who argue
that the Israel obvi essentially
overrides independence US policy
preferences to the detriment of the u.s.
interest and they go as far to say that
the invasion of Iraq was in large part
due to these rare lobbies influence and
on the other end of the spectrum we have
people like Stephen Zunes and professor
Chomsky and others who basically say
that the Israel lobby really hardly has
any independent influence and that it
only appears to be powerful because its
agenda happens to mesh pretty well with
that of the centers of power in the US
and furthermore those policies are not
basically harming US interests as
defined by those centers of power
um now I think that neither perspective
is entirely accurate and that while
Mearsheimer will definitely exaggerate
the extent of the israel lobbies
influence on foreign policy I still do
think that
a strong argument could be made that the
Israel lobby has driven policy in a way
that was harmful to US interests now
when I talk about the Israel lobby
I basically accept a variation of the
definition of Mearsheimer and Walt of it
not the original one that came out in
their paper that was a bit too broad and
vague and for that matter bordered
tautology in that it basically said
anybody who's ever lobbied for the
interest of Israel as part of the lobby
but they take a more sophisticated
definition of that in their book which
is the one that I sort of like think is
somewhat accurate so when I say the
lobby I'm talking about national
organizations whose primary an explicit
purpose is the promotion of Israel's
interests in the United States so we're
talking about groups like AIPAC the
Zionist Organization of America the
Israel project Christians United for
Israel as well as media watchdog groups
who's basically primary purpose is to
tilt media coverage in Israel's favor
groups like camera and honest reporting
and others and then on top of that there
are allied groups to the lobby those are
groups or organizations who's even
though the interests of Israel are not
their primary focus they nevertheless
happen to basically mesh with those of
the main organizations and here I'm
talking about the broader right-wing
Christian evangelical movement think
tanks who basically their views of
analysis on world affairs are tinted
through Israeli eyes like the Washington
Washington Institute of Near East policy
and other organizations that basically
happen to share the views and the
interests of major pro-israel
organizations and and mainstream
political science literature basically
the determinants of success for interest
groups have been fairly outlined you
know they include things like membership
size financial resources unity
institutional complexity access to power
coalition building and so on and I don't
really have time to get into how the
Israel lobby measures up on each one of
these but suffice it to say that it
measures up very well in fact the Israel
lobby is extremely powerful in a way
that basically every mainstream
political scientist does acknowledge if
you
one of those details basically you can
read for example the meerschaum revolt
book and then you look at US policy
towards Israel you see that Israel is
the single largest recipient of US
foreign aid receiving roughly three
billion a year 3/4 of it this one
working all right
um you see that Israel is the single
largest recipient of US foreign aid
receiving roughly three billion dollars
each year two-thirds of which is
military aid and that's about to be
converted into entirely in its entirety
to military aid as well you also see
that Israel is the only country that
receives that aid all in one allocation
at the beginning of each fiscal year is
not basically required to account for it
Israel receives privileged intelligence
from the United States and it's a lot to
develop nuclear weapons when many other
countries obviously under the threat of
force over the thought and then you look
at US policy towards the
israeli-palestinian conflict to
reiterate something that Professor
Chomsky just said essentially there has
been a practical solution on the table
not a perfect one but a practical one
for over 20 years now which calls for
Israel to withdraw from the occupied
territories to facilitate the creation
of a Palestinian state the Palestinians
accepted this so did the Arab League and
virtually the entire international
community through the United Nations and
Israel is single handedly essentially
blocking the solution and the u.s. is
backing them up I mean even not just
with continued military and financial
support but also diplomatically the US
has vetoed over 40 UN resolutions that
are critical of Israel's violations of
international law and human rights which
is to put that in perspective is greater
than the number of vetoes used by all
other permanent members of the UN
Security Council combined on all matters
so it is kind of obscene figure so you
look at the Israel lobby and you say
it's powerful and then you look at US
policy towards Israel and you see
unrestrained support and people might
feel tempted to come to the conclusion
that the Israel lobby is responsible for
this policy
but it's not quite that simple because
there are other forces that could
account for that policy as well for
example Israel has been of extreme
strategic utility to the US they
defeated Nasser's nationalism in 1967
which the u.s. really needed they
protected King Hussein's regime during
the events of Black September from
Syrian intervention they supplied
weapons to apartheid South Africa and
the Contras in Latin America at a time
when it would look bad for the u.s. to
do that directly and in fact illegal and
basically Israel is the dominant
military force in the Middle East and
it's a stable one so that makes it it's
an extremely important for the United
States strategically so even the u.s.
grant strategy could also account for
you a support for Israel furthermore US
military aid that goes to Israel
basically huge parts of it something
close to 70% comes back to US military
corporations
so in essence US military aid to Israel
is a form of subsidy to US military
corporations so you can see that the
defense establishment would also be in
favor of this strong relationship so
given the fact that the defense
establishment the u.s. grant strategy
and the Israel lobby I'll advocate a
policy when you have multiple players it
becomes a bit difficult to isolate and
assess the influence of one particular
player and in this case that's the
Israel lobby and the way to resolve this
is to look at cases where the Israel
lobby alone contradicted basically was
in conflict with the other forces that
support disscourn policy now
unfortunately the record does not
resolve this problem because the record
shows mixed results so for example
professor Chomsky and others have
pointed to the 2005 incident when Israel
sold sophisticated military excuse me
sophisticated military technology to
China against us wishes the u.s.
essentially humiliated Israel and the
lobby didn't say a word
they forced Israel to apologize publicly
which they did in 1993 there was the
incident where Israel was working out a
deal with North Korea
by which North Korea would not would
cease to provide long-range missiles to
Iran in return for Israeli investments
in North Korea which you know when
you're talking about missiles to Iran
this is something of serious strategic
national security interest for Israel
and the u.s. in an effort to isolate
North Korea was basically able to compel
Israel to to end the deal and in both
those cases the lobby you know didn't
say a word and even in cases where the
lobby did get active protesting for
example there was the case of 1981 when
the United States wanted to sell the
Reagan administration wanted to sell
advanced radar systems to Saudi Arabia
these were a lobby essentially threw a
fit and they got very active and they
gave the administration a very difficult
time and they almost canceled the deal
only here the defense industry namely
Boeing and United Technologies basically
who had hundreds of millions of dollars
on the deal basically got together and
said that they were not going to allow
this to happen and sure enough you know
in cooperation with the Saudis and with
the administration that was bent on
getting this through they were able to
crush the lobby's opposition and the
deal actually went through so all of
these cases demonstrate the limits of
the Israel lobbies influence but on the
other hand um Mearsheimer and Walt can
point to cases where the Israel lobby
did overcome administration opposition
so for example in 2002 aerial drone
launched operation defensive shield in
the West Bank killing hundreds of
Palestinians at a time when Bush
basically was trying to gather a support
for the Iraq war so he did not want to
be on bad terms with the Arab world and
so he demanded that basically Israel and
it's encouraging a couple of days later
he clarified that he meant that Israel
should end it immediately and a day
after that Condoleezza Rice got on TV
quite upset saying immediately means now
we expect the Israelis to end the
incursion now and in response the Israel
lobby essentially swung into action
there were a hundred thousand emails
that were sent to the White House from
from Christian evangelical coalition's
basically AIPAC applied pressure on
Congress and the next thing you know
Congress is passing resolutions
basically supporting Israel's
encouragement in defiance of the
administration's requests the office
and eventually Bush essentially caved he
realized this was not worth the fight
and he said that Israel had responded
satisfactorily to his call but Israel
had actually done no such thing
so this is one example of the lobby
overcoming US administration opposition
another would be the settlement building
that goes on virtually every president
up until the second george w bush
opposed settlements quite explicitly and
in the case of George Bush the first the
opposition was so intense that he
actually threatened to cut off loan
guarantees to Israel and you know there
are comments heated comments on the
record from James Baker and and Bush the
first that basically showed that they
were quite upset about this but in the
end the settlements continued and the
settlement continued until today so I
think the what the the pattern that you
see emerging is that when we're talking
about the israeli-palestinian conflict
the Israel lobby seems to be able to get
its way over administration opposition
but when you're talking about
broader strategic issues the lobby does
not stand a chance in the face of more
powerful players and what's important to
note here is one might say well the
israeli-palestinian conflict is not a
strategic interest so the u.s. doesn't
care that much but the problem here is
that this is not entirely true is that
US policy towards the
israeli-palestinian conflict has been
very costly for the United States on
many fronts the obvious ones being
national security and the United States
image in the world and then of course in
terms of strategic positioning in the
Middle East and for that matter in more
details about access to oil and things
like that so on this particular issue
you can say that the Israel lobby does
override independent US policy
preferences on the israeli-palestinian
conflict to the detriment of the United
States and we can I know running out of
time so we can talk more about that
there isn't going to be much of a debate
because I basically agree with almost
everything you've said and I've written
it many times
on I think you're right in taking the
narrow definition of the Israeli Lobby
the even in the book Shimer
sometimes define the lobby so loosely
that it becomes close to pathologists
but if we keep to organized groups like
for example
Christian evangelicals who as you say
were instrumental you think Lane I don't
agree we're instrumental and overcoming
administration opposition to the
operation defensive shield destruction
of Janine yeah that's a big group of
Christian evangelicals are probably a
third of the Republican vote maybe a
quarter of the population huge electoral
block but the government does not go
along with them they their position is
that the US should support every Israeli
action everything blow up the Temple
Mount in which they've tried to do and
the US government doesn't do that their
reason for doing it is because they're
dedicated anti-semites their position
probably the most extreme they want a
lot of them are accept the particular
interpretation of the rapture
interpretation of revelations which is
what's going to happen is there's going
to be a war you know Goggan Mago and all
that business and then there'll be a
great war and Armageddon and everybody
that will be slaughtered and the those
who are saved mainly us will rise to
heaven what happens at the Jews they're
not saved okay so that's anti-semitism
at its most extreme level and yes they
do want to support Israeli policies
because they'll lead the war but the
u.s. government doesn't go along with it
in the case of operation defensive
shield and notice that if that's used as
an example then the lobby argument is in
a serious self-contradiction walton
Mearsheimer as you point out try to
claim that israel drove the united
states to the iraq war on the side
that's completely contradicted even by
their own evidence but suppose we accept
that it's true the logic that you
outlined is that the lobby wanted the
lobby harmed US interests by forcing the
u.s. to accept the jeanine operations
even though it was undermining support
for going to war with iraq well you
can't have both positions know either
the lobby drove us to the war with Iraq
or the lobby harmed the effort to go to
the war with Iraq but not both so I
don't think that example shows much and
in fact I don't know of any evidence the
u.s. cared one way or another whether
Israel smashed up Janene yeah it it
caused a lot of problems and what to
adopt the standard racist terminology of
what's called the Arab Street we don't
talk about the British Street or the
French Street but there's a thing called
the Arab Street namely the population
and yeah the population didn't like it
in fact Bush is much more unpopular in
say Saudi Arabia than not enjoyed or
Jeanine or some bin Laden but the
question is whether anybody cares about
that I mean as long as the us-backed
tyrannies are able to completely control
their own populations then US government
didn't care that much about the
populations and they have been able to
do that the most value than oldest ally
of the United States and the region is
actually Saudi Arabia it's where the oil
that most of the oil is it's also the
most extreme fundamentalist tyranny in
the world and if you look at what harms
US policy we know not just now but way
back back in the 1950s in 1958 President
Eisenhower asked his staff why there's a
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and the National Security
Council highest planning agency just
given an answer they said there's a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States supports
harsh brutal tyrannical regimes and
impedes development and democracy and
does so because it wants to control
their oil they want on to say the
perception is true and that's the way we
should do it so yeah that harms US
interests if you think that the
so-called Arab street is something that
the u.s. cares about inside that
persists until today right after 9/11
The Wall Street Journal
did a study of the kind of Arabs they
care about what they called money
Muslims rich guys you know directors of
multinational corporations bank managers
that sort of thing people very much
embedded inside the u.s. nominated
system and asked them you know why they
were antagonistic to the US they gave
basically the same reasons they did add
the sanctions against Iraq as a major
reason and also repression of the
Palestinians but focused on the same
reasons u.s. supports harsh and
undemocratic regimes tyrannies blocks
democracy and development and does so
because it wants to control our oil okay
it's not the Israeli Lobby that's
pushing that that's the way the US has
determined its strategic goals not only
in the Middle East the same everywhere
else yeah same policies around the world
I think special about the Middle East
there are as far as the just one factual
comment as far as the scale of the lobby
you know in the sense that you correctly
define it in political science terms you
know money membership that sort of thing
that's been analyzed in detail by
Stephen zuna's and I advise you to look
at it and it turns out it's one of the
smaller lobbies it's dwarfed I mean it's
totally dwarfed by the business lobbies
which totally overwhelming and even by
things like the lawyers Lobby or you
know the real estate agents Lobby and so
on I mean it's it's influential but it's
influential I think largely because as
you say it conforms mostly to US policy
the I don't consider the cases that you
mentioned very let's take the George
Bush one case which is an interesting
one which seriously misunderstood that's
the other example that's standardly
given for the power of the lobby George
Bush number one and his Secretary of
State James Baker where that took the
most extreme position against the
Palestinians and support of Israeli
expansion of any president but they did
it in secret so they weren't getting any
Lobby support or pressure for it I mean
we now know what's about I mean actually
the documents were known but they were
kept quiet they took the position they
supported the coalition the Israeli
coalition government position the Shimon
Peres Yitzhak Shamir position that there
can be I'm quoting it down no additional
Palestinian state between the Jordan and
the C meaning Authority is a Palestinian
state namely Jordan and it can't be an
additional Palestinian state and the
fate of the territories they said has to
be implemented in accord with the wishes
of the government of Israel that was
endorsed in the Baker plan the December
1989 Baker plan which endorsed exactly
that position that's the harshest
position anti Palestinian position has
been taken by any American president and
I was George Bush the first no Lobby
pressure
Bobby probably didn't know about it but
yeah that's the position they took it's
kind of like saying that the Jews don't
need Israel because they already had in
New York so there have to be an
additional Jewish state it's very much
like that if anybody were to say that
he'd be called a Nazi you know but
that's the position that George Bush the
first and James Baker took no pressure
from the lobby the conflict was over
something else
Yitzhak Shamir would happen to be
unusually abrasive he would wait until
James Baker showed up in Jerusalem and
right at that moment brazenly announced
we're setting up a settlement and
such-and-such a hilltop okay you don't
treat the Godfather that way you have to
be more polite you have to do it the way
she Amman Paris does you say thank you
master we will not settle any more
settlements just like you say and a week
after you leave we'll put up the outpost
and build it and then everybody's happy
exactly what happened with Condoleezza
Rice on her last trip that's the way
you're supposed to behave if you'd
behave to abrasively to the mass
he's not gonna like it so therefore they
made a weak threat to withhold funds
which of course didn't live up to but I
don't really think this had anything to
do with the lobby
however this entire discussion
illustrates the two points one white for
me personally it illustrates oh I don't
even get into this discussion I haven't
even written about it I think one
paragraph somewhere because there's
something mildly or maybe seriously
distasteful about the whole discussion
in my opinion as I said a nation is
dying in front of our eyes okay and we
are focusing on an abstract discussion
which may be appropriate for some
seminar somewhere about the the various
factors that influence policy which
overwhelmingly coincide but sometimes
differ and we're asking well you know
which one is more influential in the few
cases that they differ actually I
basically agree with you where
for this abstract discussion where US
major US interests in the sense of
interests of those who matter where
they're involved the Israeli Lobby has
no effect on issues that don't matter
much to the United States yeah the lobby
can have an effect just like the
Armenian Lobby can have an effect on the
Armenian Lobby came very close to a
couple months ago - seriously harming US
relations with one of his most important
allies turkey over the Armenian Genocide
but they came pretty close and they're
you know that's what lobbies can do but
where any serious interest is concerned
they're just told to get lost that was
true on the China case 2005 was
particularly striking again in 2000 the
North Korean case was a very important
case North Korea had agreed to stop
sending any missile technology or any
other advanced military technology to
the Middle East the entire Middle East
in return for Israeli recognition and
the Clinton administration simply
told them no and for Israel that is a
very serious significance there was a
big fuss couple months ago about Israel
allegedly bombing some site in northern
Syria which is supposed to claim had
North Korean support well whatever
tiny element of truth there might be to
that there would be nothing at all like
that or even any threat if Israel had
endowed the u.s. pressure then we get a
real issue I think you find that's what
happens as far as the Arab Street is
concerned the u.s. doesn't care any more
than Saudi Arabia does however there's
another point that should be made let's
take this abstract discussion which
personally I find distasteful about
which factor and policy which of the
many factors and policy that almost
always coincide has more weight and
let's ask does it have any practical
consequences how the discussion turns
out okay so suppose we decide with
Walton Mearsheimer that in cases you
know that there are cases of serious
concern to you know powerful American
interests where the u.s. backs off
because of the lobby well if that's true
there is a consequence a tactical
consequence one concept for me it would
be terrific I could stop writing books I
could stop writing articles and stuff
getting talks all over the place stop
getting vilified you know nothing all
I'd have to do or you'd have to do or
anyone else concerned what the problem
would have to do is put on our ties and
jackets go to the headquarters of
corporate headquarters of Lockheed
Martin Intel hewlett-packard that
Microsoft Warren Buffett Exxon Mobil and
so on and politely explain to them that
their interests are being harmed by a
lobby that they can put out of business
in 30 seconds with their political cloud
and economic force okay games over we've
won
does anybody do it I mean does anybody
even bother to laugh no yeah I mean it's
laughable if there was a if the few
being interests looking out for
themselves
didn't like what was happening there's
nothing about it and what they're doing
about is investing in Israel not under
pressure of the Christian evangelicals
or APEC but because they find it useful
to have a powerful state most powerful
state in the region actually with
military forces that are more with air
and armored forces that are larger and
technologically more advanced than any
NATO power let alone the region outside
the US and that is totally subordinate
to the United States Israel made a
decision a long time ago that it would
sacrifice security for expansion which
makes it totally subordinate to the
United States has to do with the US
wants very loyal performs any task
that's wanted right on the periphery of
the major oil-producing regions the
Pyrenees who run the oil producers
really don't mind as long as they can
control their own populations so it's a
you know two system that works for the
interests of the few big interests who
look out for themselves and we see it in
their behavior if we think they're being
misled well we should explain it to them
so that they'll change their behavior
and put the lobby out of business but as
far as I can see that's the only
practical consequence to this discussion
otherwise it's an abstract discussion
you can have often some seminar room
about the relative weight of two factors
and policy formation that almost always
coincide but sometimes conflict and
while that's maybe an intellectually
interesting discussion I can't get much
involved in it when we see a nation
being killed under our eyes just a
couple of things to point out
um if if I thought that this discussion
was entirely of no consequence to
basically activism to end the occupation
and so on I would consider it
distasteful as well the only thing is
that I think if you operate under the
assumption that the reason why the u.s.
supports the monstrous policy is that
Israel carries out on the occupied
territories is because of the influence
of a lobby then the natural course that
what that leads people of conscience to
do is to say okay well we'll all we have
to do is present a counter voice and
sort of like try to drown the other
voice create a counter force and that
would influence policy in the correct
direction but if you take the view that
the Israel lobby has no influence and
that the US is not really susceptible to
Lobby pressure then that might give
people the impression of this thing is
entirely hopeless if the Israel lobby
does not influence policy we certainly
would not be able to and therefore
advocating for basically a Palestinian
human rights would be an endeavor that
is not worth taking so I think for me
I'm invested in saying that there is a
lobby and if you counter it you can be
effective as a way of getting people to
basically get more involved in the issue
now the argument here is that the reason
why the Israel lobby gets away with what
it does with regards to the
israeli-palestinian conflict is because
this is an issue that does not matter
for US policymakers and my are key
materials per cell so the opposite is
that it does take a couple of examples
so you know in the u.s. grant strategy
in the region they're genuinely afraid
of Iranian influence now the fact that
the US has allowed the conflict to
perpetuate and that fact that Iran is
able to basically take advantage of that
by you know spreading its influence
throughout the region by taking
advantage of popular hostility towards
Israeli policies I mean this is
something of serious threat to the US if
there was no conflict Iran would have
nothing to play on to spread its
influence and so strategically speaking
it seems of crucial importance for the
United States to take active steps to
end the conflict or the question of oil
for example you look at Saudi Arabia
there's a reason why there
pushing for the Arab initiative
basically to resolve the conflict as
well they presented it again in 2007
basically they're desperate to end the
conflict because the conflict is a major
source of popular discontent throughout
the region and if Saudi Arabia is going
to continue to basically until the
United States line this is going to
cause problems for it in terms of
governmental stability so again here you
have a case where it seems that you know
oil companies certainly have an interest
in the stability of the Saudi government
and the Saudi government thinks that
this is an important issue to resolve
for stability so it seemed that it would
follow that oil companies would be in
favor of basically putting pressure to
end the conflict so now like the way I
look at it is you know going to the oil
lobbies and actually talking to them and
explaining these things does not become
so outrageous an idea and if you want to
take it a step further so take for
example you know especially with the
potential election of McCain if the u.s.
actually invades Iran or bombs it for
that matter it's going to need the
logistical support of Persian Gulf
countries now given the current climate
in the Middle East um those governments
are gonna have a very difficult time
basically about giving that logistical
support for the u.s. their survival is
seriously at risk now if the u.s. gives
something in return for these regimes to
pacify their populations you know
looking at it harshly from a strategic
perspective from the US the best thing
to do would be to resolve the
israeli-palestinian conflict to
basically make things easier for the
broader grander grand strategic plan for
the United States in the region so
basically what I'm arguing here is that
the perpetuation of the
israeli-palestinian conflict is of
basically is a strategic harm for US
interests in a very serious way that the
US policymakers should take seriously
and the last thing on the size of the
lobby basically you have polls that are
taken of Congress and their staffers who
basically consistently show that they
view the Israel lobby as one of the most
influential lobbies in Congress Bill
Clinton refer to them as basically said
AIPAC was
that a packed Lobby is better than
anybody else does in Washington so he
have this recognition on behalf of
Congress that the Israel lobby is
influential and so if it is correct as I
and most Americans think it is that US
policy generally speaking is influenced
is over influenced by lobbies and then
you add to that the fact that Congress
acknowledges that the Israel lobby is of
tremendous influence it follows that the
Israel lobby does have a significant
influence on policy and the last thing I
want to point out is the Israel lobby
boasts of its ability to defeat people
running for political office basically
who do not toe the line
I mean there are countless statements by
AIPAC members and many others who
basically say you know we've cost
so-and-so the election and you know we
hope that people will get the message
now and you can actually see that in
effect when you look at presidential
candidates falling over each other
trying to portray themselves as
extremely supportive of Israel for the
obvious reasons and I'm thinking if a
lobby has that much control over the
political survival of people running for
office and in Congress then they de
facto if not episode facto have an
influence over policy because nobody can
you know basically take on a policy that
the lobby would consider unacceptable
again I have only a small factual
disagreement and agree with the main
thrust the factual disagreement has to
do with the power of the lobby and here
I won't go through the details but I
just suggest that you look at Stephens
unas is careful detailed analysis of it
which shows that there's almost no
effect on candidates running for office
the most passionate supporters of Israel
are mostly in safe districts like Nancy
Pelosi nobody's going to run against
them and the lobby has basically no
effect of course they claim to have an
effect the Armenian Lobby will also
claim to have an effect there you can
find two or three scattered cases but
basically on Congress the effect is very
marginal now it's true as you say that
Congress thinks of the lobby as very
powerful
but that's the reason for that is that
the real lobbies they just take for
granted like they're not going to tell
you that the business lobby is powerful
or they you know the telecommunications
lobby or the farm lobby I mean sure
that's what we're here for we work for
them they're not powerful that's who we
are
you know Clinton's not going to say the
telecommunications lobby won the 1990 I
shifted policy in 1996 to win the
election because of funding from them he
did but you don't talk about that
because that's the way the system works
yes there's nothing to discuss that's
like saying I'm you know I'm breathing
air or something so sure they don't
refer to the real lobbies but as far as
the rest is concerned you are actually
giving an argument in favor of what I
said I think if if I don't happen to
agree with you on the analysis of the
situation entirely but suppose we accept
your analysis completely the US policy
with regard to Israel Palestine is
harming the interests of the few big
interests who were in the country okay
like the ones I mentioned Lockheed
Martin Exxon Mobil Intel Microsoft
hewlett-packard all the ones who seem to
be very happy with the present situation
so US policy is actually harming their
interests well there is a tactical
consequence namely we're wasting our
time here we should be going to their
offices and explaining to them that this
marginal Lobby which they can put out a
business in 30 seconds is harming their
interests as if they can't figure it out
for themselves but since they somehow
can't figure it out for themselves we'll
explain it to them and that's over there
as far as the induced passivity try to
find an argument against that tactical
consequence as if you wrote up to walk
Mearsheimer many times no answer because
there is no answer if it was harming
their interests they would do something
about it what they are doing about it is
supporting a just where I described the
increasing investments
Israel yeah it's fine yeah maybe it's a
minor nuisances here and there but they
do it as far as making people passive I
think the opposite is true if you
convince people that the lobby is
all-powerful then there's nothing much
to do about it we can't stop the lobby
from functioning if you think it's the
US government which is following certain
policies that we don't like there's a
lot that we can do about it we could
turn this into a functioning democracy
in which popular opinion matters and
it's not just on this issue but on a
whole range of other issues and that's
what we should be doing you are watching
a mini debate on the Israel lobby
between professor Noam Chomsky and
Ahmedabad a part of a conference
sponsored by AG cma on US policy in the
Middle East we'll be back with more of
the debate after this short program ID
you are watching the Arabic hour a
program of news views culture cuisine
and the Arab American experience to
watch today's program or any of our
previous programs log on to
www.mptv.org/outdoorwisconsin
here and then here this means that the
most powerful part of luggage is the
fact that they can attack people in that
Bedini apeople who write about
Palestinian rights and about what Israel
is doing people who try to organize to
do something about it that's where the
lobbying is really powerful and very
effective and trying to keep people who
in ten years you know all the kinds of
things that they've been doing so that's
where we mean our organization's we
struggle with them all the time
government struggling with them the
other group is that you know keeps
mentioning Siemens unas and I just want
to announce it's going to be speaking at
Tufts on April 25th and 26th there's a
conference organized by New England
United on the first point just brief
comment as you mentioned Walton
Mearsheimer give several definitions of
the lobby one of them is the narrow one
which I agree you focused on there's
another one that they give which is that
the lobby is just those people who
dedicate themselves to supporting
Israel's interests no matter what well
the problem with that definition it
includes practically the whole
intellectual community after 1967 not
before but after 1967 when Israel formed
a real service to the United States
you've the intellectuals just had a love
affair with Israel so I mentioned
dissent before the Democratic Socialist
Journal if you check it before 1967
Israel's that barely mentioned or maybe
mentioned with contempt afterwards you
get Michael Walter and Irving Howell and
passionate Zionists they take a journal
it takes a Norman Podhoretz you know you
can't get a more extreme an advocate
take a look at his book making it which
was published in early 1967 Norman
Finkelstein who's
assiduous researcher went through all
this and he'd made some interesting
discoveries he mentioned his rule
doesn't care
you know 1967 that turns out there's a
big turn and when you talk about
pressure on universities no university
has to submit to a pact pressure they do
it if the majority of the faculty agree
that that's what they want to do
otherwise they can tell me get lost so
we're now talking about the lobby and
the large sense of the word which
includes the media the lobby doesn't
influence New York Times editorials you
know we're just talking about the
educated world at large which almost
reflexively supports US government
policy except in narrow ways you know
can't give a principled objection and
supports Israel insofar as it's
perceived to be associated with the
fundamental the US interest so that's a
real struggle I agree with you a major
one but I don't and it's true that the
lobbies in the forefront because they're
the ones who launched the vilification
and the slanders and so on and so forth
but they can be blocked if it worked
that they were supported by the general
community so it's a battle that is
seriously
we do have those American ships hovering
there and I wonder if you have any
insights well I don't know anything
other than what I read there are reports
in the Israeli press now that Syrian the
Syrian army is mobilizing in preparation
for a possible Israeli attack and the
scenario that they talk about is a
Hezbollah action in retaliation for the
movie an assassination in Damascus which
they and many others blame on Israel and
it's clear that Israel has been sort of
itching for a chance to invade again and
do what they failed to do last time
harmless balada that probably helped
them so it's not impossible but my own
guess is its if it takes place it would
be only as part of a broader action
against Iran the only real concern of
Israel in the u.s. about Hezbollah which
has been pretty quiet in fact from the
Israeli withdrawal in 2000 until 2006
there wasn't a single rocket firing
attributed to Hezbollah up till July
2006 what they're concerned about is it
is a deterrent to US attack on Iran so
if the u.s. decides to attack Iran or
Israel decides to attack Iran Hezbollah
rockets which may be more advanced now
are at the turn they can reign on Israel
you know that's a deterrent and they
want to eliminate it so my guess is if
there's an attack it'll that's what
it'll be instantly the same is true of
this whole discussion of missile defense
in Eastern Europe which is causing
serious rifts with the Russians I mean
for the Russians it's a serious problem
because these systems if they ever work
are a threat to the Russian deterrent
and in fact they're placed in a position
which makes them a threat to the Russian
deterrent you can read that US strategic
analysts explain it but the official
pretext is their defense of Europe
they're defending Europe against an
Iranian attack I mean you know that's at
a level of Ronald Reagan putting on his
cowboy boots and quaking in terror
because the Nicaraguan army was two days
from Harling in Texas you remember that
incident people didn't laugh because
we're disciplined around here but Europe
is about as likely to be hit by an
Iranian missile as it is by an asteroid
so if you're interested in defense it
might be putting up an asteroid defense
system unless the Iranians are dedicated
to being vaporized in one second they
would never send off a missile with a
nuclear weapon if they had one you know
because of the obvious reaction so what
the missile defense system is for the
only function it can serve apart from
being a threat to the Russian deterrent
hence the u.s. first strike with and is
as a threat to Iran it's telling it ran
no matter even if you get missiles and
nuclear weapons you're not gonna be able
to use them we can hit you first and you
can't react the missile defense
altogether is a first strike weapon it's
pretty well understood on all sides it's
saying we can deter a retaliatory strike
so we can strike you first with impunity
and that's the way it's understood on
all sides and if I think Hezbollah is
regarded pretty much the same way
Lebanon is in terrible shape now I mean
it's a it's a real pity because it's
it's a wonderful country it has every
reason to live in peace but it's being
torn apart to a large extent by outside
pressures
um my question for you how follow you
think your views on this from the Middle
East have been affected by your growing
up as a Jew in a Jewish family yeah well
I I grew up as in an intensely Jewish
environment in fact Jewish ghetto pretty
much and was a Zionist youth leader and
so on and it may surprise you but my
views as a Zionist youth leader in the
1940s are about the same as what they
were are now I was part of what was the
Zionist movement that was opposed to a
Jewish state and it was a substantial
part of the Zionist movement in those
days there wasn't an official commitment
to the Jewish state until 1942 you know
it was maybe in people's minds but it's
not official in the United States
incidentally and it remained it remained
a substantial part of the what's called
a Zionist movement in in Palestine -
that was against the Jewish state for
the kinds of reasons I mentioned and in
favor of arab-jewish cooperation they
were socialists so an Arab Jewish
working-class cooperation that was the
part of the Zionist movement I was
connected with and you know
circumstances changed so you're the
tactics you think of change but so from
and I wrote about it like so from 1967
to 1975 there was a real chance in my
view to institute what's an alcohol to
one state solution
Israel could have moved to create a
federal arrangement inside sis Jordan
Jordan to the C which they controlled
with a palestinian and a primarily
palestinian primarily jewish entity to
be federated that lead to further
integration as circumstances allow and
that would end up with some kind of
democratic state that option it would if
you're interested i wrote about it at
the time this book a lot of articles and
it was just total anathema on everyone's
on every side everybody hated it in 1970
1975 was over by the time the
palestinians had committed themselves to
an independent state and the world had
accepted
what has become the total international
consensus on it through state settlement
this proposal was gone an interesting
question you might ask is why it's
popular now when it's completely
unfeasible whereas it was anathema when
it was feasible so why is it that the
New York Times in the New York Review of
Books and so on published articles
aren't now when they would have been
willing to slaughter you when you
suggested it when it was feasible I
think you can make up an answer to that
which is not too pleasant but I'll leave
it to you but yeah I certainly influence
that's one of the main reasons I'm
interested in this one of the main
reasons why I studied Arabic for years
and college yeah major interest in 1994
I take you speaking on religious
fundamentalism in Israeli domestic and
foreign policies so 14 years later has
religious fundamentalism disappeared
from Israel is it getting stronger
what's the status
well minor correction that was Israel
Shaka giving a talk and I introduced him
okay old friend with and if you remember
the meeting was practically broken up
but yeah okay yeah but yeah it's
stronger now I'm much stronger everyone
agrees on that in fact if you look at
the the who the settlers are the illegal
settlers and the occupied territories
the ultra religious ones are their way
out of proportion to their numbers in
the population and for them it's fine if
you live in the West Bank it's like that
now when I go home I'm going to a
blessin suburb okay nice Boston sober
about them in the West Lexington you
know that's what the West Bank is it's
the nice Pleasant suburbs for Jerusalem
and Tel Aviv also happens to be sitting
on the major water supplies and breaks
up the Palestinian territories and so on
but and and you can live there
subsidized
I didn't get subsidized
the Lexington but if you move to the
settlements in the occupied territories
the illegal settlements he gets
subsidized so you got a nice house you
know superhighway taking it right to the
Tel Aviv and Jerusalem you'll have to
worry about Arabs because they can't be
seen there off somewhere else and you
get paid for it so sure people move and
the religious settlers way out of
proportion to their numbers and there is
an increasing growth of fundamentalism
not just there but all over the world
I mean Christian evangelicals have the
kind of political clout now that didn't
have 30 or 40 years ago in the United
States nothing like it some of the
numbers were about the same but they
weren't organized as a political force
then and in Israel Palestine on all
sides and in fact throughout the region
fundamental Islamic fundamentalism and
Jewish fundamentalism are increasing
part of the reason is understood that's
a great part of it as far as Islamic
fundamentalism is concerned remember
that's what the US has been supporting
all along the this most extreme Islamic
fundamentalist tyranny in the world is
Saudi Arabia by comparison Iran looks
like you know a secular heaven but and
that's been that's the leading US ally
and it's been the same elsewhere and for
good reason the main enemy has been
secular nationalism that's dangerous
secular nationalism can lead people to
seek alternative paths of development
independence and so on
so the US has been supporting extreme
fundamentalism and in fact as secular
nationalism has been destroyed as it has
to a large extent and Lebanon to both
internally because of its internal a lot
of internal problems but also externally
by force something replaces it and what
replaces it is quite often no religious
fundamentalism I suspect that's
partially true in the United States too
we have a country where 80% of the
population thinks the government is run
by the
you know a few big interests looking out
for themselves not the people and I
can't do anything about it people aren't
just going to give up they're going to
turn somewhere else
and one of the places you can turn is to
megachurches you know these are
phenomena that you see all over the
world one of the effects of the us-run
terror wars and murders in national
security states in latin america has
been a rise in protestant fundamentalism
actually it's complex because in the
1980s the u.s. was a war with the
Catholic Church but that's because the
Catholic Church in Latin America
committed a grave sin though they went
back to the Gospels and took them
seriously there they're a radical
pacifist message which you're not
supposed to pay attention to and they
were organizing peasants to read the
Gospels and think of what they mean and
so on so they had to be wiped out there
was a two-pronged effort the u.s. ran
the violent side the Vatican diffract
them and so on and it did pretty much
undermine them and one of the
consequences of a considerable rise in
Protestant extreme fundamentalism I mean
people don't just don't give up when you
destroy their hopes they turn to
something else and it yes it's increased
