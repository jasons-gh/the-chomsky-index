I rejoice in your disposition to argue
the Vietnam question especially when I
recognize what an act of self control
this must involve it does sure it really
does I mean I think it did add a kind of
issue really very well sometimes I lose
my temper maybe not they've got to like
because I do without smashing the
goddamn thing you say you say in your
reason for not losing another you say
the war is simply an obscenity a
depraved act bye week and miserable men
including all of us including myself
well including every that's the next
sentence seems so short because you
count everybody in the company of the
guilty I think that's true in this art
yeah but does he one of the points I've
seen since the theological observation
isn't it no I don't think because of
someone points out if everybody's guilty
of everything that nobody's guilty of
anything no no I don't I don't believe
that see I think that I think the point
that I'm trying to make and I think
ought to be made is that the real at
least to me I say this elsewhere in the
book the what seems to me a very
innocent terrifying aspect of our
society and other societies is the
equanimity and the detachment with which
saying reasonable sensible people it can
observe such events I think that's more
terrifying than the occasional Hitler or
lemonade or other that crops up these
people would not be able to operate were
it not for the this apathy and
equanimity and therefore I think that
it's in some sense the sane and
reasonable and tolerant people who
should who share a very serious burden
of guilt that they very easily throw on
the shoulders of others who seem more
extreme and reviled
