Noam Chomsky is the principal architect
of generative linguistics and has been
the driving force in recent evolutions
of a theory including in the development
of the principles and parameters
framework which one commentator has
described as quote the first really
novel approach to language in the last
two-and-a-half thousand years
professor Chomsky has also been a key
figure in the development of the
cognitive sciences generally indeed the
most important figure in the development
according to Harvard's Howard Gardner he
is perhaps most famous for his writings
and lectures on international politics
and in media theory it is less well
known however that Professor Chomsky has
been an important figure in
anglo-american philosophy over the last
50 years and that he has been a key
interlocutor with all the leading
philosophers of language in mind within
that tradition he's had lively exchanges
with for example willard van orman quine
hilary putnam donald davidson saul
kripke john searle michael Dahman and
now a new generation of philosophers and
i guess the first question has to be the
following given everything to sign your
play why do you bother with the
philosophers that's the most fascinating
topic of all so they grew up with and
still I'm obsessed with why do you think
other linguists or not or in general
other scientists don't seem to be as
engaged with the philosophical community
scientists tend I think to be involved
in their own technical problems and
often don't think much about you know
what it's about so like I mean I've had
I for many years taught courses in these
questions and would have students read
sake lines papers in which he argues
that everything they're doing is
complete we called folly and only gives
argument saying can't possibly do it
this way the students will read the
papers but then go back to doing and
saying
go back at doing exactly the same work
but it just read is folly and can't be
done and so on and so forth and I think
that's not unusual if you read the
scientific literature there's a lot of
expressed contempt for what philosophers
have to say about this so you will read
somebody working on the neurophysiology
of consciousness hot topic and there'll
be an obligatory first couple of
paragraphs and while the philosophers
have muddled this up for centuries but
now we'll show how it's done but with no
engagement in the arguments that have
been given or the thinking behind it
does it trouble you that say most other
linguists don't engage philosophers on
these issues it troubles me because not
so much that I'm a visit sick connected
to a deeper problem it I think it should
trouble us that we're not thinking about
what we're up to and those questions
happen to be the domain of what
philosophers pay attention thread let's
let's turn to some of these philosophers
and some of the things that they've said
and the first one I want to look at is a
harvard philosopher hilary putnam uh in
the mid 70s he wrote a paper called the
meaning of meaning which is very
influential and I guess the key slogan
that came out of that is that meanings
just ain't in the head agree disagree or
just is that just incoherent its
incoherent without further explanation
first you have to tell us what meanings
are and you can't decide whether they're
in the head or not until we know what
they are if by meanings we have in mind
what people have in mind when they're
using the word in English then driven on
the head they're all over the place
talk about the meaning of life it's not
in the head if you have some more
technical notion in mind you could
explain what it is
if the technical and and there it's a
matter of choice you can define the
technical notion so it's in the head or
so that it's not in a hit
we need to find technical notions you
have a choice the way it's done in the
sciences and the way to ought to be done
is you define a technical notion in the
context of an explanatory theory you
know just different as technical notion
in mountain space so let's ask what's
the explanatory theory in which we're
going to give a technical motion which
will pronounce meaning or pronounce it
some other way and then we'll ask
whether and that theory is a sensible
theory and does it place this technical
concept in the head or not but all that
extra work having them done why can't we
say that's just a pre theoretical notion
of meaning and what we want to do is try
and elicit a torus if I it in some way
or other you could do that but the
million ways of doing it so what about
the meaning of life for example that's
part of the pre theoretical notion it is
it is it sure guys I mean I thought
people talked about the meaning of
what's the meaning of life yeah and you
think that's the same notion of meaning
as when they say what's the meaning of
the word now this you know it's a huge
range of things what did he mean by
saying so and so usually as dude what
was it intention you know or something
like that right so part of a pre
theoretical meaning has to do with
people's intentions in fact when you
talk about the meaning of a word that's
a rather English specific location and
we could focus on that if we like but
and if you want you can try to clarify
it but again to try to clarify a pre
theoretical motion make sense within the
framework of an effort to understand
something to expand explanatory account
well suppose we go with the following
attempt to clarify or at least
introduction of a piece of technical
terminology which is the philosophers
will talk about the content of a mental
state or the content of some sort of
expression hmm is that helpful
no because content is a technical notion
it's not being used in the sense of the
ordinary concept content right and it
used by noun West since pregnant infect
and creepy and others it's
typically used to refer to something out
there so the content of expression is
not needed by definition because we've
defined it to be not in the head or then
the question is well was that of
anything do their motions of decided
meaning do with their understanding of
the way language works and is used okay
that's the question and you can
certainly think it is very little to do
well suppose we thought of it this way
we suppose we thought of the enterprise
being sketched in the following way
there are two ways in which you might
study primates for example you might
study primate Anatomy in which case
you're just concerned about you know
bones and muscles and tendons and so
forth and then you might also study
primate ecology in which case you're
studying the relation between the
primate in its environment and I take it
that what these philosophers are talking
about here when they talk about external
content is that they're saying a part of
talk about meaning has to be analyzed in
terms of thinking about the organism the
human organism in relation to its
environment right so it has to if you
want to study the relation between the
human organism and its environment but
if that's fine there's nothing wrong
with studying the human organism in its
environment that's what sociologists are
doing all the time but if do it
seriously if you want to do it seriously
you ask first of all you let's go back
to primates when you studied primates in
their ecology you don't just look at the
anatomy of primates you look at the
physiology of primates the what you
might call mental processes of primates
I mean the way they seem to be
interpreting the world the perceptual
perceptual abilities of primates in fact
what you try to do is exploit to the
extent you can what we know about an
individual eight you know chimpanzees
you want to know where we understand
about that eight and that information we
will bring to bear in the study of how
the ape interacts with other Apes and
with the rest of the environment and so
on that's the way it's done with
primates or with ants or anyone else I
think that's where our dealing with
humans so we should ask ok well what do
we understand about
to these the internal nature of the
creature that's doing all these things
and to the extent that we understand
something about that we can ask sensible
questions about how it interacts with
the external world with other people and
so on and so forth do you think that
could potentially inform the sort of
interest investigations sure because
there's no order you can study the
sociology of eight communities and I'll
tase nothing good day is important about
the internal thinking processes of apes
or even their internal anatomy and vice
versa prism of master science goes all
the ways here's another technical term
that's been used reference you consider
that to be pinnacle here as well or
until it's explained as until here once
it's explained then it becomes not it
well it you see one thing I've never
quite understood is is exactly what the
problem is with reference because I mean
I can say okay now I'm referring to this
coughing that's different okay I could
quote a different okay you're talking
about an action of referring right that
we that's a common sense notions right
in English and every by language I know
there's some way to talk about such
actions but what Flusser isn't
introduced is in different notion a
notion that's supposed to hold between a
linguistic entity and something in the
world now that's not referring referring
as an act that people do yes just what
it is that Raza fears yeah but and it
goes way back but well and it's just a
fact okay so let's say well if you want
to make up a technical term which you
pronounce the same way yeah first of all
it's questionable but he should
pronounce it the same way because it's
misleading but if you do let's at least
keep clear that it's a technical term
kind of like a physicists use energy you
know they don't mean it the way we do in
ordinary language they mean it the way
they say they mean it so let's take the
technical term refer or denote or
whatever you want to call it and tell us
what it's supposed to
what what you tell us what you mean but
I didn't tell us what explanatory theory
it enters into so when a physicist
defines energy in I just in the
definition you're interested in the set
of principles and assumptions and social
problems and so on within which that
technical concept is introduced and then
you look and see how good the theory is
well here we don't have any theory and
we don't even have an explanation with
the technical notion is so it's
impossible to talk about it yeah I think
it might be a mistake to think of it as
a technical notion I mean I think it's
just a sort of persisted way of
describing certain basic core level
facts right so for example I might say
well once you understand that people
refer to things and so forth it's not a
hard step to say well okay I can't
certain names are canonical II used to
refer to certain things in certain
individuals so the name Noam Chomsky I
mean I can ask the people I can ask the
audience here what person in this room
does that term refer to or you could ask
what what do you what do you use that
term when you refer to something in the
world that you can ask but when you ask
what the term refers to you're assuming
that there is a relation between terms
and things and they have to explain what
that relation is because that's a new
one we don't have that in ordinary
language and in fact I think it's
leading us off into a wrong picture as
Vidkun Stein would have called it and
it's leading us to a picture of language
which is we know what it's based on
I mean it's based on things like frege's
you know the theory of arithmetic and
it's just the wrong picture for language
I think
let me I want to change directions
briefly we may actually end up being
sucked back into this issue Donald
Davidson in a paper called a nice
derangement of epitaphs epitaphs said or
basically argued that there's no such
thing as language and I've always sort
of thought that you probably you may not
want to admit it but on some other you
probably agree with that right no in
fact I think he ended up contradicting
himself
I think there's some discussion of it in
here or somewhere if you look at the end
of the paper
turns out he's proposing that there is a
language in the technical sense
technical sense of an internal cannabis
procedure that relates sounds and
meanings and so on he says there's no
emotion of language in another sense the
sense of some community property or
whatever well okay first of all I don't
think that's true it's just it's not a
scientifically usable sense but I think
the paper is just rife with confusions
if written about so you think there are
such things as languages
yeah there's such an informal like
there's such things as the meaning of
life you know I understand it when
people ask what's the meaning of life so
yeah there's such a thing as the meaning
of life there's such a thing as the
financial crisis in Argentina you know
there are all kind of things in the
world but if you want to proceed to
understand what you and I are doing
those notions just don't help you've got
to look at it differently the way we
look at primates other primates and both
let me read a quote from something you
wrote recently okay we said out that
people think that among the constituents
of the world are entities that are
simultaneously abstract and concrete
like books and banks or that have the
amalgam or properties we discover when
we explore the meanings of even the
simplest words like river person city
etc um you think the average person take
leave and that's a technical question
okay it's a question if you try to
figure out what a person's folk science
is you know how people think the world
is actually constituted of entities
which is not do I talk about books of
course we talk about books we talk about
the meaning of life and so on but if you
ask people well you know how do you
think the world really works that's
probably that's my science right like
you go to some other community and you
try to figure out what what's their idea
about how the world works like maybe the
classical Greeks thought the power of
pulls the Sun through the sky or
something that's their folk scientific
picture of how the world works
that's a hard topic you can't just do
armchair philosophy about it that's why
ethno scientists have to work
and when they work what they thought if
I think if they worked on people like us
instead of just talking about it in a
you know in the common room they would
discover that our folk science yours and
mine does not include entities that are
simultaneously abstract and concrete and
does not include entities like the
meaning of life that doesn't mean we
can't talk about I'm sure we talk about
them all the time but we don't least I
don't and I presume other people don't
think of them as constituents of the way
the world operates these are we don't do
that when we're talking to each other
informally now that sounds a little bit
more moderate than than what you've said
elsewhere here's a passage from I
believe this is from new horizons we say
in the domain where questions of realism
arise in a serious way in the context of
the search for laws of nature objects
are not conceived from the peculiar
perspectives provided by the concepts
economists absolutely right so that
there's several different enterprises
you have to distinguish here and I don't
I don't think it's more or less matter
it's about a different topic when you're
trying to understand something about the
nature of the world you and I and
anybody you start with some kind of
what's called folk science almost every
society we know has some picture of the
way the world works which is more or
less commonly shared if you try to do
this more reflectively and carefully and
you know bringing in other criteria and
probably being bringing in other
cognitive faculties we don't know that
for sure but I suspect it then it
becomes the enterprise of science which
is a different enterprise and a peculiar
one that's not folk science its science
that works in other ways this comment
has to do with our culture in which the
enterprise of science is understood
right our intellectual culture and in
that when we try to find out how the
world works we discard the concepts of
common sense very quickly but it sounds
to me here like what you're saying is
that the only things that are real right
are the things that science tells us are
real so
sounds like what you're saying here is
that well this table isn't real but
maybe you know quite realism the
honorific term okay you use anyway like
I mean to say that if I say something is
true and then I add well it's the real
truth I'm not saying there are two
different kinds of truth the truth and
the real truth I'm just emphasizing what
I said and the term real is basically
used honorific lis sorry guy you can use
it on terrific lis in various ways if
we're trying to find out the way the
world works
and to really understand it in the
manner of the sciences we very quickly
give up common sense notions if we're
carrying out folk science you know less
reflectively probably using different
cognitive faculties we also give up
common sense notions but in different
ways well you can say a lot of I mean
claims about something being honorific
like real being honorific you know Alan
Gibbard for example has argued that
terms like rational or honorific or
moral or honor if well I don't agree
with it I think it real is quite do
what's the difference in these cases
there because I think rationality is
something that we can understand and
morality is something real and it's part
of us and we can try to figure out what
it is we can try to figure out what our
moral faculties are we understand
something about what rational action is
but about reality we have to ask what
we're talking about right and if we're
talking about reality in the enterprise
of trying to discover the way the world
works in a physics department or a
linguistics department or whatever
common sense notions are irrelevant
if we're trying to explore our intuitive
understanding of the way the world works
common the common sense notions are
relevant but we discard them if you have
if you using it in a more informal way
like is the meaning of life
really or okay well look there's a sort
of space between ethno science and
science right and common sense and all
of those and it's been explored by
philosophers firm for 2,500 years and
it's called metaphysics right that's
different okay so that is a question
about whatever science as a branch of
science
FMO science is the branch of science
that tries to figure out what people's
beliefs are about the way the world
works right metaphysics is not I
understand that but do you think that
metaphysics is impossible
science is metaphysics okay goodness
talk about what the world was made of
all right so but then the question is
why do you think that science gets to
claim what's real now let me give you an
example so the scientific image bakso
and frozen is a scientific anti-realist
so he says the things posited by science
quarks that are not real but mid-size
earthbound objects are real now you've
got the flipside of all right right
don't have any side because I don't
think the word real is sensible enough
to use on they're all real in different
senses if you're trying to understand
the way the world actually works whether
you're busting frozen or you or me
we're going to go to the scientists
because they tell us how the world
really works if we're interested in
exploring people's common-sense beliefs
we'll go to the ethno scientists let us
see what they describe ever interested
in something like whether there are
events or whether there are properties
or whether there are neurological sums
or something
let's take events which plays a
prominent role or modern cemented right
so here you can ask a lot of different
questions for one thing you can ask
whether in say David Sounion semantics
where there's a lot of or anything that
developed from a de vente based
semantics whether the things whether
what are called events are internal to
the mind or outside hit right but I
think they're internal than why can't it
be both what they could then we're
asking another quiz if we're asking well
how do these things that are internal to
the mind relate to something the outside
world will say okay let's take a look at
what you mean by an event so for example
is the American Revolution an event yeah
it was a portent event in history does
that event include the fact that the man
who the indigenous population called the
town destroyer
took off a little time in the middle of
the revolution to destroy the Iroquois
civilization is that part of the event
called the American Revolution well not
when you study in school you know
you want to find out about that at the
end you go to probably the Iroquois I
remember but the ones that were left or
you've got to look it's a serious
scholarly history then you find out that
one part of what was going on in the
event that we call the American
Revolution was a side operation in 1979
to wipe out the Iroquois civilization so
that the colonies could expand if they
got rid of the British well as that part
of the event or isn't it well you know
here come hard questions about you but
we're really going to call events in the
outside world and those questions don't
have answers because they are you know
they're highly dependent on our
interests our perspective their goals
all kinds of factors so I don't think
we're going to find external events in
any sense worth pursuing like fair
investigation trills at external events
just be complicated object be anything
you like but it is is what is the town
destroyers exploit part of the American
Revolution or isn't it
well that event it's not your choice but
there's no answer yeah but now it sounds
like you're saying that well I have
representations of events right the
representations orientation
representations I representation is um
which we formally call event right but
now one might ask what on earth is a
representation it's a representation of
well see that's a mistake that uh comes
from a philosophical tradition the way
the term represent is used in the
philosophical tradition it's a relation
between an internal object and an extra
external objects actually it's not the
way it's used either in ordinary speech
or in the sciences so when when a
perceptual psychologists say that talks
about an internal representation of you
know cube or something they don't have
any cube there they're talking about
something that's going on in the head in
fact what they may be studying and
usually our study is a relation between
things like Kista scopic presentations
and the internal events there's no cute
but nonetheless they talk about it in
the internal representation I mean the
concept internal representations are in
here the
concept internal representation is used
in the sciences and I think that's
ordinary speech to in ways which don't
involve a relation between an internal
thing and an external thing I mean that
derives from a particular interpretation
of the theory of ideas which said though
ideas represent something else I should
interjections anyway I should say that
that's not the interpretation of the
theory ideas that were given by the
people who used it so let say Hume for
example I quote him in there what he
ground he raises a serious empirical
question he says is a it's about the
nature of the terms of use is the
identity that we ascribed to things
meaning how do we individuate things
right and he asked the question well is
this a peculiar nature common to the
thing or is it what he calls fictitious
a construction of the mind right and he
says fictitious there is no entity there
is no common nature there's no nature
common thing there is a construction of
the mind which we used to talk about the
world but he's not made of things I mean
he was not an ideal it was not an
idealist I'm not here he's saying we
interact he believes there's an external
world out there there's a coffee cup on
the table and so on but he says that the
he's talking about the individuation of
things how we organize things how we
construct their picture of the world
right and that involves the way our
minds work
and that doesn't mean the world in there
no it's just what his predecessors
called our cognitive powers which used
the data of sense to construct an
account of the world and he's saying
well you want to look at the identity of
thing the identity that we ascribe to
things like what makes us call something
a book for an event and so on he saying
what's the fictitious in the sense that
it's a construction of the mind based on
the date of sense that's not an idealist
position in fact that's the position of
modern science because people will call
you a crypto idealist when they're
misunderstanding what idea was okay let
me there's an issue that I wanted I
wanted to get to here and this involves
the thing we mentioned about
representations and whether
representation require
there being something that it is a
representation of now in a very
important and somewhat influential book
by saul kripke there's a revival of the
sort of vidcon's dhania argument about
rule-following let me just read the
relevant passage here so in that book
kruky says if statements attributing
rule-following or neither to be regarded
as stating facts nor to be thought of
explaining our behavior would seem that
the use of the idea of rules and
competence in linguistics needs serious
reconsideration even if these notions
are not rendered meaningless I know
you've I've written written down that I
mean they're alleged like crucial words
if right okay and beyond and the fact is
that in the way in the sense in which
the term rule is used in for thousands
of years in fact in the study of
language it's not the kind of really had
in mind so if somebody if you read a
book you know you study Latin let's say
or you studied it a thousand years ago
they would have a rule that tells you
you know Wendy uses the ablative case or
some right
that's not a rule and vikins nonsense
it's a description of a part of the
language right so the questions about
rule following just don't arrive but we
don't need to get hung up on the rules
and so Edgewood East or not I understand
that but in a certain sense he's talking
about any sort of computational state
but there so take take just a computer
alright forget about human beings for a
second see computers are different story
il K was looking I guess let me get into
it yeah okay yeah see what what why
aren't these questions asked about
insect right I'm an insect when you
study insects you attribute to them
computational state right is that a
problem
I mean is it not real like if you say
that an insect is doing you know is
determining the position of the Sun as a
function of the time of year and time of
day and here's the computation it's
using isn't that really why isn't that
science ah that would be but the
argument would be that the reason you
can get away with that is because you're
talking about what it's contagions that
you're attributing to the insect our
external istic gleen anger and that is
you couldn't do it in less do you see
where you had an investment true you
could do it in an experimental situation
in which you have a white and in fact if
you knew how to do it you could do it by
stimulating the
external sensory organs of the insect it
would all be interior there isn't
there's gonna be a Sun there no it's
just that yeah you're talking about it
the way it happens actually in the real
world but the same thing we would say
the same thing in an experimental
setting where you don't have an external
world well because you're talking about
the internal construct computations of
the insect on the occasion right love
sent notice doesn't matter what's out
there not a saving notice to shift there
though because he went from saying I you
went from saying you don't need the Sun
in the experimental setting to say and
you don't say you could run the
experiment in a world that didn't have
the Sun and that's a different story
right that's not a different story the
point is if you look at what insect
scientists are studying they're studying
what 17th century philosophers used to
call the constructions of the mind on
the occasion of sense now it happens
that in the world that they're looking
at the occasions of sense happen to be
related the fact that there's something
93 million miles away but the study
could go on as if it's what Hillary
called a brain and of that and the
studies are internalist
I because we know anything else to study
but this is disputed right I mean there
is this dispute about David Marr right I
mean there's two stories on this - Tyler
Burge and Martin Davis for example argue
that maras sort of fraught with
externalist sort of yeah but they're
just miss reading him okay I mean in
fact the have the know more personally
but I'm not sure if he was here he would
say this if you look at the informal
exposition in Moore and Mars vision
let's ablevision you look at the
informal exposition in order to motivate
what he's doing he says well you know
imagine you know an elephant or son or
anything like a stick figure and you're
trying to and you we want to know how
that thing out there is interpreted by
the visual system as you know some
three-dimensional object right however
if you look at the experiment
experimental procedures of more they
didn't have elephants out there in fact
what they were using was to kiss the
scopes and if they so were they were
having you know dots on screens
and if they had known how to stimulate
the optic nerve that would done that
when you go from the informal exposition
to the actual science you see that like
everything else it's a study of the
internal nature of the beast and in fact
you know and they would have loved to
get to the point where they could tell
you something about how you identify a
you know an elephant but they never
going to be near that however even if
they did it wouldn't matter whether the
elephant is there or not it would matter
what sensory what's the occasion of
sense again the 17th century formulation
of this was I think quite appropriate on
the occasion of sense the cognitive that
sounds archaic but the cognitive powers
of the mind construct complicated
internal structures which have all sorts
of properties and gestalt properties
what Hume later called the identity that
we ascribe to things and so on and that
looks correct and that's the way modern
science looks at it the fact that the
informal expositions you know to sort of
motivate what you're doing talk about
identifying objects on the outside
that's fine but you have to know how to
distinguish in formal expositions from
the actual scientific program and if you
look at the actual program they never
looked at things outside I saw it aside
from tickets to scopic images because
they're as close as you can get to the
occasion of since we're it's but time to
move on to our very eager studio
audience here so let's turn to them hi
how are you um I you mentioned event
semantics and how that's sort of been
pulled into well or is a part of some
linguistic research and I'd like to ask
a question about that and just hear more
about it and the the way Petrovski uses
it in the article and yeah in the book
has to be on your table he'll take a
sentence we've been referring to this
book and I should point out it it's
called Chomsky and his critics which
just came out from Blackwell's right
and the the articles by Paul Paul
piotrovsky I think and so it'll take the
sentence John boiled the water and I'm
going to ignore the sort of the larger
context but and and then turn that into
something that's left something like
there was an event of which John was the
agent and it was concerning a boiling
and the theme was water terminated in a
boiling excuse me and the theme was
water something like that right and then
and then piotrovsky pulley tries to fit
that together with a syntactic account
of how that can how that formal
representation can turn into the the
sentence that you hear so you see you
recognize in your reply that it's open
question whether that is that with the
subject matter of this whole analysis is
in the language faculty or in the
cognate is something it's Anna carbon
Department of system system going all
internal right that's the assuming that
full syntax in the sense of it involved
with internal computation right fine so
the the the question then is is is and
you say it's an empirical question
whether it's it's in the language
faculty or in the cognitive system so
first of all how what would be some ways
to determine empirically what what that
is and also what would it even mean for
it to be I have a trouble understanding
what it would mean for it to be in the
language faculty because then it seems
like our language faculty has certain
meta fits a certain event metaphysics
built into it event metaphysic it's a
well first of all there's no event
metaphysics in the ordinary sense of
event events are things out there and
all of this is formal manipulations
inside and we're now asking the question
what is the architecture of the of the
mind which is like asking what's the
structure of some benzene molecule you
want to know the structure of the
benzene molecule we can't just think
about it you know you have to have some
theory that tells you how you look at
such questions well the study of the
architect Errol answers to the question
what the architecture of the mind is but
that come easy to find you want to find
out what the language faculty is well
you know you're going to add when you
talk about any subsystem of an organ
say the circulatory system or the immune
system or the digestive system or
whatever it may be you're kind of
proposing that it makes sense to look at
a complex organism as as if it has
components but each component having
kind of an integrated character with its
own properties it's worth studying in
itself it's not separable like you can't
cut the immune system out of the body
but you're saying there's things it's in
every cell you know but you're saying
look it has properties you can studying
by themselves you can learn things about
them when you put the whole picture
together you hope you'll understand
something about the organism well saying
when you're studying the cognitive
architecture we want to see is there a
component call it the language faculty
we don't know what it is if they
discover it and refine it and change it
is there a component which is critically
involved in what you and I are doing in
some fashion which has its own intrinsic
properties so is it going to turn out
say that it has a particular interface
conditions and then some kind of
internal recursive computational process
or if it does then we can the more we
understand about that and how it fits
into the general cognitive architecture
the clearer of these questions become
about whether something's inside it or
outside and those are very concrete
questions and it takes an afro you know
the would a corp referential relations
relations of intended referential
dependency okay are they inside the
language faculty or outside well that's
a substantive issue if you'd ask me 10
years ago I was at inside and now I
think there's evidence that they're
outside right on the edge and the reason
for that has to do with beliefs about
how the language faculty works so if the
language faculty does involve optimal
computation that requires cyclic
derivation and if an afro looks at
global properties conditions that your
learning theory well it's outside but
that's a question that you can't ask in
advance you have to ask what was it look
like what it seemed these faculties are
like
the more you learn about them the more
you can sit you know formulate these
questions clearly and that's the kind of
question that comes up about the
internal notion of event is it in the
language faculty the semantic component
of the language faculty or is in some
other faculty that's linked to it and
you can't you know you just can't
speculate about that you have to learn
about an egg assess my question I just
just from from ignorance I have a hard
time picturing what kind of empirical
evidence would count in judicata between
them and if I'd known it I would have
okay so I think these are the kind of
quest like what is the empirical
evidence that bears on whether and Afra
is on one or the other side of the
border of the language faculty when are
the empirical evidence in my mind at
least turns on whether in fact there is
a single secret derivational process
that goes you know they're called phases
stepwise that's an empirical question
but you know all kinds of things bear on
it coming from everywhere alright and
once that empirical question is
sharpened you can ask whether a global
property of an a frozen side your answer
thank you actually similar questions I
might say arise on the phonetic side so
takes a prosody prosody appears to have
global properties okay so is it inside
or outside the cyclic derivation which
is forming bigger and bigger unit well
if the properties really are global
account to it but then you can't answer
that you know and that the kind of
evidence that there is and that comes
from everywhere I might come from
chemistry for all we know that when we
try to figure out how these processes
work
you've made it clear that science plays
a primary role in philosophy and I was
curious to know what role if any does
philosophy play in science here I think
it helps to look at the question a
little more historical depth if you had
asked Hume are you a scientist or a
philosopher he couldn't answer because
there was no distinction if it asked
taunt are you a philosopher or scientist
he couldn't have answered in fact until
the latter part of the nineteenth middle
of the nineteenth century there was no
really clear distinction between science
and philosophy I mean some if you study
better than science and Oxford and
Cambridge it's that it's the department
of natural philosophy or moral
philosophy because philosophy was just
you know science which is one part of
philosophy it weren't the sting by the
latter part of the 19th century they
sort became separated and after that's
really a matter of choice you know
disciplines don't exist and we construct
them so I mean you know themes have to
have ways of organizing departments
because it's too much trouble that I do
everything but there's no boundary to
what's in chemistry you know and there's
no boundary what's in philosophy just
depends what philosophers want people
call so who come out of this tradition
want to stay and a lot of what they want
to study is questions and the
foundations of science or this you know
or or say the kind of things that the
centrosome is trying to clear up using
the results of science these are all
fine questions and people tend to call
them philosophy you could call them
parts of them at least you can call
thoughtful science or reflective moral
theory or you call me anything you want
but there's a range of questions which
have come to be in the domain of
philosophy and they can extend all over
the place I mean there are people in
philosophy departments that are working
on the foundation of quantum theory and
making contributions to it
hello I'd like to go back to inject
navigation once more and I take it that
we explore insect navigation because we
want to find out how insects navigate in
their natural environment and your right
to to point out that in an experiment we
can replace the Sun by by an artificial
light and so on but I mean it seems like
we still in an extremely in the whole
explanatory context we cannot just do
without the Sun and the actual objects
in the real world because otherwise I
mean an explanation of insect navigation
becomes meaningless and so it seems to
me that we have to have the assumption
that insects represent the actual Sun
and not just dots of light and we don't
have to have that in fact the way
science works of course you know you're
interested in the outside world but if
you're taking a physics course here they
don't use videotapes of what's happening
outside the window because it's just
useless until you let you figure out how
the world is working so you disregard
that beyond the earliest stages of
science I meant the earliest stages yeah
you see apples flowing from trees and
that kind of thing but as soon as you
get anywhere you start designing
artificial situations called experiment
in which you try to refine the evidence
so that it will shed light on principles
which you believe will ultimately bear
on what's going on outside the window
but that's not what you're looking at
the prints when you're studying an
organism say an ant you don't miss you
see that you know the ant is figuring
out where the Sun is and as a very
strange computation we can't do it as a
function of time of the day and time of
year but as you go beyond you ask well
what are the actual computations going
on inside that and if you can get far
enough you would set up experimental
situations and which wouldn't bother
with the Sun you'd figure out what those
internal computations are you then find
that they enter
for all kinds of other things you know
they're not done in isolation and out of
that you expect you're going to shed
some light on what's going on when the
court when the occasion of sense that
the insect is operating on happens to be
in a connected to an external object
like the one 93 million miles away but
that's just the kind of consequence of
the investigation of the and but if I
could follow up on this question I mean
this seems to be inconsistent with what
you say and this reply to Ludlow here
where you're quoting gala stuff right so
you say gala still 1990 argues that the
representations play a key role in
animal behavior in cognition here
representation is understood as an
isomorphism the one word one one
relation between mind bein brain
processes and an aspect of the
environment to which these processes
adapt the animal's behavior it's not
inconsistent he's making an empirical
claim it's a very interesting one and
which is is an introduction to a couple
of volumes on animal representation and
his conclusion which I quote there is
that for animals there is in fact a
one-to-one relation and isomorphism
between an internal event and some
property of the external world like an
odor it's the example aided by so the
property the external world was
particular odor which is out there in
the world or right but you could if you
knew how to do it you could just use the
sensory organs and he says that's the
way animal representation works which
this one the one correlation between
things that are outside the animal
though you can really studying them at
the sensory boundary and the internal
representations well if that's correct
that's interesting fact about animals
and they're very different from humans
in that case so then maybe he's right
about it you know it could be that they
take the example I mentioned there I
think it's taken from him that an ant
some species of ants at least will
identify a corpse of a conspecific on
the basis of a particular odor of course
if you give that odor and there's no
constant if ik around although exactly
the same thing because according to this
picture that he's saying well it's just
trigger
by the owner which usually has come from
conspecific but if you could control
odors the way you can control lights if
you could get the same behavior
according to em there's no conscious of
it yeah but but just one one more
clarification question it seems to me
that no scientists can claim he has
explained any kind of animal behavior if
if what we take to be its its natural
environment doesn't play an essential
role in this explanation and so I think
if there's no if we if the relation
between an ant Anna and the Sun for
example it doesn't show up in this
theory then we haven't really explained
what we wanted to explain well if it
depends what you want to explain if you
say the sciences as the southern
sciences have developed since Galileo
this is something of an innovation they
really are not trying to account for the
phenomena of experience I mean
indirectly that's what motivates them
but what they're trying to do is
discover the principles that enter into
the way the world functions and if you
ask the guys in the physics department
here can you explain what's going to
this videotape of what's going outside
the window they won't even bother
answering I mean I can't say anything
about that we too complicated way too
many factors and it's not even their
topic their topic is to find out the
principles of nature so like when
Galahad Galileo had a lot of problems
with this you go back and look at the
history he had a lot of trouble
convincing the funders the rich
aristocrats who were the funders mosted
convincing them that it's worth studying
something as ridiculous as a ball
rolling down a tinkle of a frictionless
plane nor first of all there's no such
thing you know who cares anyway you know
and it was a real suck it was a
conceptual breakthrough to get to the
point where you began to understand that
the phenomena of the world are of
interest for the sciences insofar as
they provide evidence for the principles
that of nature and as soon as you
proceed very far you find out that
the ordinary phenomena of nature is
useless for this purpose and you do what
are called experiment and sometimes
thought experiments like you look back
at Galileo there's no reason to believe
he ever dropped balls from the top of
the Tower of Pisa if you look at the
argument he gives a purely conceptual
argument convincing one to show that
that's what's going to happen and it
didn't matter whether he observed it or
not effect you don't observe it but if
because argument was convincing because
the logic of it and that's true a lot of
his experiments in if he read through
them you know scholars have now
determined he couldn't carry out his
experiments there was no way for him to
do it some of them he probably did you
know someone who's thinking about but
but the point is almost none of them had
to do with observations of you know what
you just a casual look at the world the
same with the theory of perception so
for example take an example of Descartes
which I'll adapt to this situation but
it's a Cartesian example if you look at
it if I look out there what I see is a
lot of people sitting in a you know in a
room well Descartes points out you know
literally that's not what's hitting your
eye what's hitting your eye is you know
some something that's coming from that
guy's head and that guy's foot but
there's nothing about people sitting in
a room nevertheless what you see is
people sitting in a room and then he
says well how does this happen and then
comes the whole story about on the
occasional sense the cognitive powers
make things complicated construction
which include imposing the structure of
people sitting in a room of these
fragmentary sense sensations that are
coming to me but you don't in perceptual
psychology but as it proceeds you don't
study phenomena like people sitting in a
room that's just way too kind with it
but this isn't fair to the questioner
though because he's not he's not arguing
against idealization I mean you could
have a perfectly controlled experiment
and still talk about for example in a
simple take an old sort of skinner type
experiment the pigeon pressing a bar and
then you can describe that behavior as
the pigeon going moving its whatever
it's claw or whatever or you can
describe it as bar pressing B
right now so I mean this is not it's not
an issue about idealization our partner
could easily
yeah but we're asking - he was at Rome
at least I understood him to be asking
something different if the scientist
cannot give an account of my seeing
people in a room they're not giving an
explanation that's far too strong I mean
the scientists are giving explanations
even if they can't get anywhere near
describing real-life situations and in
fact that's about all of modern science
the bar pressing is an interesting case
because Skinner did impose on it the
interpretation for oppressing and that
turns out to be wrong it turns out with
closer look that the pigeon pecking
which is what I was doing actually
incorporates different instinctive
behaviors the behavior of pecking for a
seed and pecking for water turn out to
be different
instinctual behaviors which happen to
converge in this experiment is mislead
yourself if you go it isn't as if isn't
that scariest mistake is that he he was
an internist and if he'd been an
external list then you would see them
pressing for a seed and forehead
pressing for water it's nothing
different these are different ranges
this and they do the externalism and
internal ISM I mean the motivation for
distinguishing seed from water comes
from observing pigeons but if you want
to really carry it out further you'll
find out what's going on in the pitchers
pigeons head on the occasion of scent
and if you could carry out the programs
far enough you'd forget about the seed
in the water it just like David Marr
does he doesn't talk about external
things because he's trying to really
discover what the principles are so as
an internal ISM and external ism what it
has to do with is giving the right
idealization of the wrong idealization
and we're always doing that I mean every
experiment involves you know all kinds
of interpretation instead what you're
going to think about this thing and that
thing as the science is getting will
refine you try very hard to not to cut
it out because you can't but it leads to
be conscious consciously aware of what
you're putting
yeah so you can sort of compensate for
it if it's the wrong thing to put in
okay next question I think I have a much
less sophisticated question than the
previous one but you have characterized
in I language generally as interface of
sound and meaning and at the same time
here you've also been very critical of
the various senses of the term meaning
and reference so I just wanted to ask if
you could clarify what do you mean by
meaning well I mean that's again like
David Moore saying I'm trying to figure
out how you see an elephant we start
with the intuitive notions of sound and
meaning whatever they are and you know
you go back to Aristotle and he
describes language is a pairing of
something like sound of meaning saying
in Greek the Meo that's where we start
with but as we proceed we're going to
refine both of these notions so sound as
it's used here it doesn't have to do
with what you and I call sound and
ordinary experience talk and meaning
will be something very special so like
maybe it will be you know David Sounion
event semantics okay maybe it will be
something built on that and maybe sound
will be something built on you know Mars
my colleague Mars Haley's conception of
instructions for articulatory gestures
or it will be whatever it turns out to
be as the science is progress and it
will have ended up having some loose
relation to what we call sound of
meaning but you know more so than energy
or work or life or any of the other
concepts that are dropped in the
sciences although they often keep the
sounds when they talk about their new
concepts
so that's to be answered you know not to
start with okay thank you okay I guess
that's I guess that's it thanks a lot
appreciate it
you
