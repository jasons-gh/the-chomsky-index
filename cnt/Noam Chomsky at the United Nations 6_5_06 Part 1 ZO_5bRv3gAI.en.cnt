hey open to you question do you think
the US will attack Iran I think there's
you know don't sit in the Oval Office
obviously but there's pretty good
evidence I think that the Pentagon is
strongly against it that the US
intelligence to the extent that we know
anything as opposed to it and its fact
it's hard to find anyone in favor of it
except that planning happens to be in
the hands of an extremely small
unusually autocratic group of people
there's a kind of a don't like to use
the word but a sort of a quasi fascist
element in the administration they want
top tight control of planning in every
respect secrecy authoritarian control
and so on and it's really up to Cheney
Rumsfeld rice maybe two or three other
people they might decide to do it I
suspect if they do the reason will be
that they have created such a
catastrophe in Iraq they've created a
situation where they can't stay in they
can't get out and they might just decide
that almost as an act of desperation to
just hit the whole system with a
sledgehammer and see what happens you
know that's I mean a you know man-eating
tiger in your backyard is dangerous but
a wounded man eating tiger in your
backyard is a lot more dangerous
and I think that's what we're facing so
I can't predict
let me get you two something less
political what do you think about global
warming what do you think about the need
to use less oil and what do you think
this is going to do yes to global
politics well there's just overwhelming
scientific consensus not only that
global warming is taking place but that
human intervention is accelerating it
and there's also an overwhelming
consensus that it could be catastrophic
and it's what's called a nonlinear
process you can reach you can increase
and then come to a point where it just
has radically different effects possibly
catastrophic effects there's debates
around the around the edges but the
consensus is real and there's no doubt
that the use of hydrocarbons that
accelerates significantly and yes there
should be a very concerted effort to
follow the near unanimous advice of the
international scientific community and
change move significantly towards
conservation towards renewable fuels
towards modifying social and economic
arrangements so as to reduce the the
intensity of the focus on hydrocarbons
and remember a lot of this is just
social engineering and it's not an
economic necessity so the probably the
the most extraordinary social
engineering project maybe in history
took place in the United States in the
late 40s and 1950s to try to destroy the
quite efficient electrical
transportation system and replace it by
and train trains you know I have to tell
you the USS one of the worst rail
systems in the industrial world and
that's all planned it was planned very
carefully and it to try to the effort to
shift the economy to reliance on oil
automobiles trucks airplanes and so on
hydrocarbon consuming economy that led
to big social effects it led the
suburbanization of the country to
destruction of the inner cities all
kinds of social and cultural changes and
that's not graven in stone you know the
social engineering projects can be
reversed this was a combination of state
and corporate planning in fact it was
literally a conspiracy literally went to
the courts and they charged General
Motors Firestone rubber and Standard Oil
of California with conspiracy and
destroying the Los Angeles public
transportation system to try to shift it
to oil and cars and so on I think they
they were actually find if I recall I
think they were fined $5,000 just about
enough to pay for the victory dinner and
afterwards but and then the government
came in with national defense highway
act that defense has to be put in any
legislation to pass it pretext was you
have to move missiles around the country
or something like that and so on then I
went down to state and local levels
which extended the same planning well
you know all of that can be reversed its
state corporate planning which can be
turn be turned into a same direction and
the American population is very strongly
in favor of it so for example take say
the Kyoto Protocol's
it's not everything but it's a small
step the population was very strongly in
support of them in fact so strongly in
support that a majority of bush voters
thought that he supported them because
such an obvious thing to support they
thought well you know Bush must support
it which tells me something about how
American democracy functions but there's
no doubt that there's a public support
fair degree of public understanding and
it just has to be done
not only here but everywhere where the
results could be extremely dangerous
what has to be done cut I don't think it
has to change the political I mean has
changed the political systems become
more democratic but that's for a lot of
reasons so the public opinion enters
into public policy right now there's an
enormous gulf between public opinion and
public policy on a whole range of issues
including this how to happen everybody
knows you have to institute
energy-saving devices which are many of
which are already available and can
there'll be more with further research
that conservation is a major part of it
and shifting of a general lifestyle so
as to reduce reliance on excessive
energy consumption I mean this you know
it's not a law of nature that you have
to sit in New York gridlock in New York
City and your Hummer or an SUV
you know that's those are social and
economic policies and they could be made
different will that will that solve the
problem well no one knows it's possible
that were passed a tipping point where
nothing much can you know where maybe
you can't stop a serious catastrophe but
one thing is certain the longer you wait
the less you do the worse that's going
to be and methods are understood they're
not great secrets
