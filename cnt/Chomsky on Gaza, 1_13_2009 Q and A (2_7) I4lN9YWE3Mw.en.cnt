first of all I just would like to offer
my condolences I would like you to
elaborate a little on on you talked
about the plan this was planned planned
in a military sense and planned in a
propaganda sense and I would like to ask
you to elaborate on aspects of the way
in which the propaganda side has been
given expression in a couple of areas
first of all I noticed that CNN and
Reuters among other major corporate
media used the term incursion repeatedly
secondly another reporter from the New
York Times you mentioned ethan bronner
Steven Erlanger who's reporting from
Jerusalem had a story reporting on what
Israeli military sources had reported
had discussed with him apparently
regarding people with weapons in Gaza in
civilian clothes popping out of holes
and and and and went into other details
and thirdly there was interesting timing
to me of a major front page feature
story based presumably on timed leaks
regarding Iran and Iranian the the fact
that the Bush administration had
supposedly said to Israel that they
would not be authorized to fly over Iraq
to bomb alleged nuclear facilities but
that instead the Bush administration
were intensifying covert operations
against those alleged programs in Iran
and finally the interesting fact that
all merit supposedly spoke out against
the occupation only weeks before
launching this major invasion okay I not
sure I got everything but the meticulous
planning of the invasion is discussed
extensively in the Israeli press
and to some extent here too so and it
describes both aspects the military
planning on the propaganda effort and
its how effective it's been you know one
could argue it's there's one area which
is very effective in American elite
opinion and in the press but probably
not among the population the only poll
I've seen shows the population very
divided roughly 5050 on the invasion
despite the massive propaganda which is
just replicated on us without deviation
in the media including the examples you
mentioned as for reliance on Israeli
military sources well of course that's
part of the part of the propaganda
system kind of like the US and Iraq
where reporters could do in if they were
embedded and meaning propaganda agents
and the freelance reporters who tried to
report some of them were just dropped
out of the corporate media others could
do it as freelancers the in the case of
Gaza Israel I simply borrowed all
reporters foreign or or it's even
Israeli because they don't know I make
sure that there's no direct reporting
what you get is you know cell phone
calls or something like that and reports
from people like not Gilbert this
Norwegian doctor and UN officials and so
on but you know that's all part of let
the call their house Barack campaign
that Israel has to word Hebrew their two
words for propaganda one of them is
standard word for propaganda the other
hospira is for their own propaganda and
the word means explanation the tacit
assumption is that everything we do is
so obviously right that all we have to
do is explain it to people so it and
then they'll understand why we're
actually exactly right and that hospira
campaign does work among American
intellectuals and Western
European intellectuals generally as for
the populations it's an open question I
should say even on the rejection isn't
although it's almost a hundred percent
supported by the educated sectors and
the media and so on of course not cold
that the facts are always suppressed
it's not among the population roughly
two-thirds of the population is in favor
of the Arab League plan normalization of
relations within the international
borders basically the international
consensus but as usual public opinion
has almost no effect on policy it's an
interesting fact about American
democracy it's in fact a matter of
principle there's kind of principal
reasons which go back to James Madison
or why that has to be the case and it
clearly is the case and the public knows
it so about ninety-five percent of the
public objects that public opinion is
not taken into account by the government
but you know there are two legged beasts
to they don't really understand
important things the but that's part of
the control about the civilians popping
out of holes now you can pull that
straight out of Nazi propaganda British
propaganda during the Revolutionary War
in fact any Imperial War I mean any
invading imperial power would be
delighted if resistance if people who
are resisting put on uniforms and stood
out in an open field so they could be
destroyed by overwhelming military force
and they get very upset when Minutemen
and others don't accept these rules they
should be wearing red coats like the
Hessian soldiers British mercenaries so
sure that's standard I mean what's
interesting is that I think you said air
langer could even repeat such nonsense
without collapsing and ridicule about
Iran that's we don't know the details
but the reports are interesting they do
indicate two things one that the US
or Israel from overflying Iraq which
would make it very difficult for them to
attack Iran and the other aspect is that
they apparently admitted that they're
carrying out terrorist actions inside
Iran that's not the first time there's
been evidence of that for some time
including major terrorist acts from from
Pakistan and Afghanistan but again
that's normal for an out outlaw state
the failure to the lack of support for
an Israeli attack is interesting I mean
I think it's pretty clear that Israel
does not want that the United States
does not want Israel to attack Iran that
could lead to a major conflagration with
huge effects for American troops for oil
supplies everything else it wasn't much
discussed but there was a resolution
congressional resolution debated in the
house HR 362 I think it was which called
for the u.s. to an effect impose a
blockade on Iran bar shipping in the
Gulf and so on it had an enormous
support a pack the Israeli Lobby was
passionately and supportive lettin
pulling out all the strings it initially
had some very overwhelming congressional
support but it was voted down it was
voted down in part thanks to lobbying by
the anti-war movement which is hardly a
massive lobby in the United States but
it was voted down mainly because the US
government didn't want it and the lobby
consistently slinks away silently when
it comes into conflict with us power for
good reasons they know they haven't got
a chance and they want to harm
themselves and this past very calmly as
well any other such cases as 40 marked
he did say in hit basically in his
resignation speech he had to resign
because of charges of corruptions
so he resigned and still in office
basically resigned and he didn't make a
speech that didn't make a speech he had
an interview in the press at that time
in which he withdrew all of his earlier
positions all of them and said that
Israel must accept the international
consensus as to withdraw from the
occupied territories and maybe a some
shipment modification of borders agreed
upon mutual modification agreed upon by
both sides in fact he went back to the
essentially the Taba proposals which as
I say were almost realized except that
Israel blocked them at the end that was
his resignation speech and it's
interesting it shows that he understood
and as you say it was followed very
shortly by rejection of possibilities of
political settlement crucial rejection
several times and the US Israeli
invasion of Gaza which is now underway
you can make of all of that what you
want
