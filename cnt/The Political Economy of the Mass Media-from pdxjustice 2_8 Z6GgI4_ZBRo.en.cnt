this because it will encoding him it
will make people so curious and so
arrogant that they will never find
humility enough to submit to a civil
rule and that's a problem John Locke a
couple of years later explained what the
problem was he said day laborers and
tradesmen the spinsters and the
dairymaids must be told what to believe
the greater part cannot know and
therefore they must believe and of
course someone must tell them what they
believe now there's a modern version of
the end of course you just mean those
categories he meant the general public
there's a modern version of that this
goes all the way up to the modern times
it's disgusting the American Revolution
and all the way through to the modern
period let's just come up to the
contemporary period now in last in the
modern period you get a much more
sophisticated development of these ideas
so for example Reinhold Niebuhr is a
much respected marla stand commentator
on world affairs he wrote that
rationality belongs to the cool
observers but because of the stupidity
the average man he follows not reason
but faith and this naive faith requires
that necessary illusions be developed
emotionally potent oversimplifications
have to be provided by the mythmakers to
keep the ordinary person on course
because of the stupidity the average man
that's the same view basically walter
Lippmann who is the Dean of American
journalists is the man who invented the
phrase manufacture of consent he
described the manufacture of consent as
a self-conscious art and a regular organ
of popular government this he said is
quite important this is a revolution in
the practice of democracy and he thought
it was a worthwhile revolution the
reason is again the stupidity the
average man the common interests said
very largely elude public opinion
entirely and they can be managed only by
a specialized class whose personal
interests read
beyond the locality that's Nibiru's cool
observers you can guess who's part of
them this is the person who pronounces
these views is always part of that group
that's the others who aren't this this
is in walter lippmann book public
opinion which appeared shortly after
World War 1 and the timing is important
World War one was a period in which the
liberal intellectuals John Dewey circle
primarily were quite impressed with
themselves for their success as they
described in their own words for their
success in having imposed their will
upon a reluctant or indifferent majority
there was a problem in World War one the
problem was that the population was as
usual pacifistic and didn't see any
particular reason going out and killing
Germans and getting killed the Europeans
want to do that that's their business
and in fact woodrow wilson won the 1916
election on a man date which was peace
without victory that's how he got
elected and not surprisingly he
interpreted that as meaning victory
without peace and the problem was to get
this reluctant and indifferent majority
and get them to be to create emotionally
potent oversimplifications and necessary
illusions so that they would then be
properly jingoistic and support this
great cause and the liberal
intellectuals were convinced that they
were the ones who had primarily
succeeded in doing this and they thought
it was a very good at ask for obvious
reasons and in fact they probably had
some role whether that as much role as
they think he could question but some
role they used all sorts of necessary
illusions for example fabrications about
hun atrocities Belgian babies with their
arms torn off and all sorts of things
that were concocted by the British
Foreign Service and fed to the educated
classes in the United States who picked
him up and were quite enthusiastic about
them and distributed them they used such
devices as what they called historical
engineering
there was a phrase proposed by Frederick
pacsun an American historian who was the
founder of a group called the national
board for historical service that was a
group of historians who got together to
serve the state by explaining the issues
of the war that we might better win it
that's historical engineering the Wilson
administration established the country's
I think first official propaganda agency
it's called the Creole Commission which
was dedicated to convincing this
reluctant or indifferent majority that
they better be properly enthusiastic
about the war that they were opposed to
that that had some institutional
consequences in fact there were a number
of institutional consequences to this
whole period one was the institution of
the national political police FBI which
has been dedicated to thought control
and repression of freedom ever since
that's its primary activity and another
development institutional development
was the enormous growth of the public
relations industry a lot of people
learned lessons from the capacity to
control to control the public mind as
they put it a slogan of the public
relations industry one of the people who
came out of the Creole Commission was a
man named Edward Bernays who became the
patron saint of the public relations
industry that's a big substantial
industry which is actually an American
creation though it since spread
throughout other parts of the world it's
dedicated to controlling the public mind
again quoting its publications to
educate the American people about the
economic facts of life to ensure a
favorable climate for business and of
course a proper understanding of the
common interests bernays developed the
concept of engineering of consent which
he said is the essence of democracy
that's and of course didn't bother
saying that there are only some groups
who are in a position to carry out the
engineering of consent those who have
the power and the resources he himself
showed how this was done often by for
example
demonizing the government of Guatemala
the capitalist democratic government
that we were planning overthrow with a
successful CIA coup he was then working
for the United Fruit Company which was
opposed to the government because it was
planning to take over unused lands of
the United Fruit Company and hand them
over to landless peasants pain the rates
that the United Fruit Company had given
us their value for tax purposes which of
course they regarded as very unfair
because they had naturally been lying
and cheating about the value so that was
his achievement and that in fact the
public relations industry in general has
been dedicated to this project ever
since the Creole Commission incidentally
is a predecessor of a contemporary
phenomenon that the Reagan
administration constructed it's their
office of Latin American public
diplomacy that's by far the largest
propaganda agency in American history
maybe one of the largest of any Western
government and it was also dedicated
controlling the public mind it was
dedicated primarily to controlling the
debate and discussion over Central
America to demonizing the Sandinistas as
one of its officials put it and
mobilizing support for the US terror
states in the region and it did it by
framing the debate by intimidating
critics by producing fabrications which
were then happily repeated by the media
so for example one famous one just to
illustrate some of its achievements when
ronald reagan in nineteen eighty-six
read a spectacular and effective speech
which convinced Congress to vote one
hundred million dollars of aid for the
Contras right after the World Court had
denounced the United had condemned the
United States for the unlawful use of
force and called upon it to end this
aggression this speech was extremely
effective it described all the whole
litany of Nicaraguan crimes and it ended
up by saying that these communists
actually concede that they're planning
to conquer the hemisphere and
under- all they themselves say that they
are carrying out a revolution without
borders that was the peroration that's
why I ended up you know big excitement
Congress voted the aid of the Reagan
administration declared that this this
meant war this was a real war and
everybody was excited and happy now that
phrase revolution without borders Axew
had already been used it had been used
by a State Department pamphlet that was
called revolution without borders
describing sandanista crimes and there's
actually a version of that phrase that
exists the phrase is a appears or
something like it appears in a speech by
sandanista commandant a Thomas burfi he
had given speech in which he said that
the Nicaraguan the Sandinistas hoped to
construct a kind of a model society a
society which will be which will work so
well and will serve the needs of the
poor so well that others will be
inclined to try to do the same thing for
themselves
