a seat oh wait a few moments until
everyone gets settled before we begin
oh now i have only two cars all right so
I loved them everyone and good evening
once again my name is Angela Kelly and I
actually like to start by thanking you
Joseph garson's as Joseph acknowledged
many of the co-sponsor groups and
individuals who made this evening
possible I think we should also
recognize his leadership
and his vision as you know we didn't
start talking with us almost a year ago
now wondering what this new moment would
be but he had this vision that we must
come together at this pivotal time as we
confront both new possibilities and
worsening crisis before us so the theme
of this evenings panel is the challenge
before us of which there are many and
they are both complicated and
interrelated as Joseph pointed out in
his welcome so as we look ahead to the
ways we can confront the intersection
intersecting challenges before us and as
we strive to find new ways and new
strategies for renewing and expanding
our activism in these uncertain times we
are very fortunate to have two extremely
evident and esteemed leaders here to
guide our thinking as we kick off this
conference this evening but before we
get into our keynote panelist remarks
which I know we are all very eagerly
awaiting I missed a few practical
announcements it seems like we must be
doing all set for speeding if there's
anyone else in the hallway please do
come in and find the fee thurs seats in
front back people will focus on the
audience will continue to help guide
straight folks in I'm just want to
remind everyone or announce if you
haven't seen in your program yet that
after the panel this evening there will
be three breakout sessions where we will
have the chance to go deeper into the
issues raised by our speakers this
evening and it will also be a chance in
the breakout sessions to continue to
build and strengthen the relationships
among us which we know are really was
key to sustaining our movements and
alliances going forward so just to be
thinking about it as you're listening to
the speakers the topics and locations
for these breakout groups are in your
packet if you have one but if you don't
there will be a group of focus on
processing this panel discussion I'm
sure
have a very rich and intense
conversation with our speakers and
macarons will stay right here in room
104 there will also be a group focused
on organized on organizing on how we
translate what we hear tonight into
strategies for action and that
conversation will happen in room 112
which is down the hall in this direction
to my left and your right and finally
there will be a third group focused on
Obama the Obama era how we engage the
Obama administration the movement up put
them into office and that group will be
meeting down the Hawaiian description to
my right your left and Pearson 1060

and that will also be in cabot
auditorium and finally just like to call
your attention to a few of the many
great materials in your packets if you
have one tonight and it's not you'll get
one tomorrow as joseph mentioned it's
very timely that we are meeting here
today
after hearing the announcement of
President Obama's policy and plans for
Afghanistan which are certainly trolling
for many of us in the peace movement who
want to see that occupation also ended
as we know there continues to be great
suffering for Americans for the Afghan
people for the world community and for
the global economy for each day these
wars go on and on so please do take a
look at the call for national action for
peace in Afghanistan and your packet or
encouraging calls to the White House the
comment line is on there we're also
encouraging folks to Mark's with many of
us within united for justice of peace
afsc many of the co sponsoring
organizations are also endorsers of the
march next weekend on April's fourth in
New York City the theme of which is
beyond war a new economy as possible so
a way to link together many of the
issues on our mind since we will do this
weekend and there's also called for
local actions for peace in Afghanistan
and april sixth and ninth and i know
some folks in the room already working
on setting up lobby visits and events
locally so please do check that out and
there is also flyer with more
information on the rally next Saturday
and how you can get tickets for that so
so we said well right now rich
conversations tonight we want to move
forward taking action so these are a few
concrete ways you can do that in the
coming days so now we can turn our
attention to it I'm sure you've all been
waiting for the remarks by our very
special guests Noam Chomsky and Bill
Fletcher jr. both of them have
contributed so much to our movements
over the years each panelist will have a
little over half an hour to share his
thoughts on the challenges before us and
then we should have some time for Q&A
and discussion so first it is my great
honor to introduce professor Noam
Chomsky as he probably doesn't see much
of an introduction in this crowd he
certainly deserves
professor Chomsky is a long time
intellectual leader speaker author and
activist whose work has been vital to
many social and political movements over
the last several decades is professor
emeritus of linguistics at MIT and the
author of numerous best-selling
political works his latest books are
failed states they've use of power and
assault on democracy and what we say it
goes and a book about him the essential
Chomsky edited by Anthony our know of is
a new collection of his writings from
the 1950s to the president that was just
published last year so we welcome and
thank you for mr. tomski
how's that ok well the overall title for
the conference is so broad that I was
quite puzzled about how to get started
but as usual the morning papers connect
a belief story as you heard was that the
president obama announced his new Afghan
policy actually what's called half pack
policy Afghanistan Pakistan that's
actually good mainly distinction between
Afghanistan and Pakistan this imposed by
British imperial power with called the
Durand Line which cuts right through the
question territories the most troubled
regions and the people there have never
accepted they don't accept British
imperial decision the Afghan government
as long as of functioning up through the
70s never accepted it so we'll go at act
act like Obama the new policy as you
know as to the new announcement is to
send four thousand additional troops in
addition to the 17,000 already
determined that he sent there there was
a little item if you search from the
Pakistani Foreign Ministers they please
don't mom anymore but that's not very
interesting so there's also
to increase the bombing to terms and
then bombers and they have effects so
one of the most troubled regions work is
the blotter fight going on that is the
jrb province let's go up the Pakistani
side of the Grand Line local act
militants there don't depress that the
fighting was largely motivated by a
drone bombing which I don't think was
even reported here where the Pakistani
president a drum hit a madrassa school
killed some 80 85 people and these are
what Winston Churchill called
uncivilized tribes they don't understand
hi marlon cultural level and they get
upset by things like that so it started
the reaction just blew up into a big war
everyone the permanent tax has that
effect how many cars I President of
Afghanistan his first message to Obama
was a plea to stop the attacks on Afghan
civilians he also called heredia a
deadline for a withdrawal of all farm
truth he even went on and said that he's
once negotiations among the whole Afghan
he's impassive that he would be glad to
welcome home are ahead of the Taliban
who's an Afghan for discussions about
how to terminate conflict and he said
that
the US but like that they'll have a
choice of either accepting it hurts
right now well the second choice is the
one that was made as soon as cars that
scar that was very popular remember love
all about it wonderful costume and so on
but hey that's just announced we after
these breaches of discipline his image
changed sharp ladies and then there's a
corrupt infective so on peptic do
something about it and what's being done
about it is what you'd expect Britain in
the United States agreed to replace it
they can't formally do it but they're
going to restructure Afghanistan which
supports outright so that a new
administrative officer will be
introduced to directly take
responsibility and you take orders from
us as far as I can be as a public figure
I don't think his letter to Obama was
ever answered except by more attacks the
there it is that it is there another
possibility gather there are other
possibilities I mean there's an Afghan
peaceful substantial one which for years
it's been calling for an end to the
violence put down your guns if you want
to be here or fine but comes with eight
and reconstruction exactly the scale is
known but at Western polls taken out in
Afghanistan indicate that about 75% of
the
relation and I want negotiation one
Afghans I mean to all Afghans and they
want to settle the run affairs of a
comical assembly your God devoted to
peace and the fires are there they
should be there for eight and
reconstruction going we don't know the
numbers Washington Post one of the few
comments on it car slotting pedelec
constables that one of the big problems
the the US forces the new forces are
going face when they get that pagana
stand it gives one of the problems will
be insurgency the other problem will be
there not one and the like to somehow
deal with this tricky issue the far as I
said is not super popular popularity
runs about fifty percent according the
Western polls bus almost twice as high
as the popularity the Western forces the
American forces so that's another taken
back difficulty has to be dealt with in
there another aspect of the escalated
attack in the AfPak is the consequences
which would be extremely grim for
Pakistan as well as Afghanistan another
aspect is that the NATO as you know as
being encouraged to that they could be a
role in this it raises interesting
questions but why does NATO exist
pretty simple question there was a
detective theoretical reason up until
about nineteen ninety believe it or not
is another question but claimed that is
dinner to the defensive alignments to
protect Western Europe from being
overrun by the Marvel sort of directed
in Moscow okay maybe maybe not but
whatever one thinks of that argument it
was gone by the time that the Soviet
system collapsed at that time Gorbachev
by mr. Gorbachev made an astonishing
concession to the west he agreed to
allow a united Germany to join a person
militarized Germany to join a day of
hustle military alliance that's pretty
remarkable when you consider that
Germany alone had practically destroyed
the Russian twice in the past century
and now it was going to join that
allowed to join a major military
alliance of charting Russia and led by
the world's most awesome super power and
history hostile but he did insist on
condition this was the bush number one
administration was favored because the
condition was that it was accepted by
pushing Baker that NATO would not expand
one inch to the east that was the end of
him that would give Russia some kind of
a buffer zone he also made a proposal
that there should be the nuclear
weapons-free zone from the Arctic the
boat patrols
any way of easing potential tensions as
far as i know that never got a response
Karzai's pleated stop killing us so that
was rejected but Bush and Baker did
agree pledge not to extend they have
each to the east the Clinton won the
next election one of his first acts was
to extend a very pregnant tank to the
Russians and of course it increased
tensions and hostility Russia dropped
its pledge no first usual but it's no
first use of nuclear weapons NATO has
never from but the pressure had drafted
insulated and rearmament development of
offensive weapons of course convenient
for all that escalated sharply under
under Bush same aggressive militarism
leads to that natural response makes the
world more dangerous well Obama's
national security adviser James Jones or
Marines on that is leading that exponent
of the idea that made 0 should expand
farther to the east end to the south at
the hoop Shepherd's that head of native
has explained that native
become an intervention force to protect
pipelines and ceilings others to ensure
that europe united states have control
of the world's energy system and that's
what we can anticipate as you probably
know there's major demonstrations next
week and stressful and protesting
nativist expansion in five minutes
existence and one task for the future
for us not far future now just to try to
do something about this tool starting
here they shouldn't be Afghanistan and
there's no reason why I should be
anywhere well that's a little bit of one
piece of the story affect it it's a
person much worse and the Bush
administration has Gideon stew plans to
establish an anti-missile system in
Eastern Europe in Czechoslovakia and
Poland a theoretical the reason it was
young was to protect Europe against the
Iranian our missiles slight problem is
that like this another problem is that
in conceivably if they had them that
Iran would ever
use unless the ruling mullahs have a
kind of a death wish I mean if Iran even
tried to arm a missile country be
vaporized aside from that the defense
system and check the Lockean Poland is
not the place that block Iranian
missiles but put it to the south the
suspect had been suggested and was
dismissed the only possible
interpretation of the missile system is
a threat against the Russian to turn
which means its first strike with and in
fact it's understood on all sides that
that's what missile defense is that ever
works to a monthly that what it might
conceivably is reduced willing to
contain the retaliatory starts never had
been first row and as I say this
recognize on both sides and it's
described in the strategic analysis
literature and by folkish congressman
and others as just the first right way
it's a weapon that says we can strike
you with impunity because you won't be
able to strike back and the Russians
don't have to read us on earth but
strategic arms journals to understand
that they can if they want they can read
four major arms journals and read
analysis by
analyst strategic analyst saying the
only possible function of the system is
as a threat for the Russian deterrent
hence of her strike weapon that goes
through the reasons were standing well
Clinton said the main his topic East
European advisers rope elbow to the
secretary Under Secretary of State for
East European affairs he testified the
expansion and this when it happened of
course it very extended he justified it
as saying that it is part of expanding
the European Union to the east but this
is nothing to do with the European Union
on other states that are members of the
European Union that aren't members of
native Sweden Finland to Austria inators
a military alliance I do with your
opinion there is a simple expansion of
what will was intended to be company the
us-run little intervention force that
one of the last things the world needs
other countries are part of this too so
for general Israel one of Israel's roles
as to services in the United States on
the recent election give us blocks
political settlement there is to be no
third base for us aggression that became
dramatically obvious it would have been
if it had been reported during the
attack on Gaza red mobility effect on
Gaza the Pentagon announcement its
ascending big shipment of arms to the
dis Rayal
pregnant no of the attack not many
people seem to care but there were a
couple of questions Pentagon and the pet
Pentagon answer comes are correctly that
these arms aren't intended for the
Israeli attack on Gaza there to be
pre-positioned in Israel so that makes
them okay the friggin question that it
be pre-positioned for anticipated the US
aggression in the region that's not so
there were no rejected that since we on
the world whatever we want to do
question presupposition incidentally
they also go probably noticed a new
yesterday that it was announced that
Israel had bombed the sedan during the
Gaza war because they claimed that they
detected and killing a lot of things in
a truck convoy they claimed that the
intelligence that detected that weapons
are being sent directly from Iran to
Gaza for the population you
that's the bench's really fact now that
justification for the bombing was
considered quite legit the commentaries
that ok that's understandable natural to
do that but for us to send arms to
Israel right in the middle of the effect
and they would question that the normal
standards apply well that's part of the
aspect native story more Buffett offers
a lot of work to do this point of
educational work that people understand
something that's happening in the world
but what about the other two major
Middle East problems that the US has to
confront bit of us already talked about
the one is brand the others Israel
Palestine well these would not have been
linked John Kerry the Senate to that
part Relations Committee senator made of
speech gave speech to the Brookings
Institute couple of days ago in which he
explained that we had a new possibility
for solving the digital Palestine
problem which has been such a hard task
for us to solve despite all our efforts
the
the new approach she said would be to
Rican sexualize it so that it's not an
Israel Palestine issue mom but a
regional issue okay that eliminates the
need pacifica problem it's a regional
issue how was it originally well our
goal should be to join the sea arab
states but he means the dictators who
rule them by violence and her with
natural friends and associates so join
with the arab states to alliance with
Israel to confront the real enemy namely
he rang so we have to be conceptualized
the problem it's now a past of getting
regional alliance which will confront
Iran and he says goes on say that up
until now the Arab states were wedded to
the famous of three nodes of cartoon and
then in 67 no peace no bird any dealings
with Israel and so on does they're
finally breaking out of that and now
they have a new 3 knows no to ran
no there any influence of fresh and so
on so a framework for broaching both
problems line up the our big Gators jump
in with Israel alliance against the real
people being here and he went on to say
how this would how this is happening for
the other developments of need that our
world he said now make this may make
them Israel Palestine agreement feasible
in his framework that one of them is
that he said by now the Arab states have
gone away from the three nodes and a few
years ago the Arab League produced a
proposal they are we proposal originally
initiated by Saudi Arabia which offers
as he put it the commitment to normalize
relations with Israel okay they can
normalize relations with Israel event
will have you finally Israel which is
been desperately seeking a partner peace
has they found one that's the Arab
states exam table normalize relationship
that will it's not the Arab League
proposal said and then something and a
lot has happened between 1967 and the
now which he wouldn't talk about it even
those of them and isn't notice that
commentators either because it's out of
history it reflects too badly on our
role in the region so long
the tasks of activists is to bring a
little history back so in between 1967
and 2009 doesn't sex when terribly
proposal was made there has been a lot
of have been major efforts to carry
forward when in fact is the Arab League
proposal namely a two-step settlement on
the international border the minor and
mutual modifications that's the official
US terminology up until nineteen seventy
one when the u.s. departed from the
world on this issue the that's the Arab
League proposed in that context it calls
for normalization of relations with
Israel but for Kerry and also for Obama
I'll come back to that the only part of
the proposal exists is normalize
relations or visitor what's happened in
between 20 in nineteen seventy one two
three knows were gone Egypt offered a
full of peace treaty with Israel code
nothing for the Palestinians just
withdrawal from the silent Egyptian
territory okay if that had been accepted
Israel within those security problems on
the Palestinian issue I think there
isn't
way they would pay attention to at least
Egypt is the major military force in the
Arab world full Chiefs treaty with ended
the security problems Israel understood
this but they rejected they rejected it
in favor of expansion at that time is
expansion into the northeastern China
where thousands of veterans are being
forcibly expelled driven in the desert
in Israel was planning to build a major
city a city with a million people
support yummy and a lot of settlements
to see him and others in the
neighborhood from which the inhabitants
of expelled so they chose expansion into
the Sinai over peace over security and
in fact that choice has governed his
early policy from then until now
security is interesting that expansion
is much higher much higher value well
the crucial question in 1971 with what
the US would do as it what woods is and
there was an internal struggle in the
United didn't be in the government
between State Department William Rogers
who wanted to continue with what had
been US policy namely no acquisition of
territory by force that means a
settlement on the pre pre genesis of
order international border with minor
mutual modification thing straighten out
some curved lines from the ceasefire
he continued proposed to continue with
that Henry Kissinger was national
security advisor at that time trying to
take over the State Department see run
the whole show and my opinion is if
Rogers had said it's raining Kissinger
with the sun shining but any of that was
instantly Rogers was in favor of this
kiss interpreted the opposite position
at his position was what he describes
proudly and is no more skill me meaning
no negotiations just forced he went out
and be your attic competition and the
United States backed Israel's rejection
of peace and favor of expansion and
that's what's in the policy ever since
up until this minute in 1976 the Arab
states that brought a resolution to the
Security Council calling for a two-state
settlement by that time the Palestinian
issue had reached the international
agenda the thirst a settlement on many
sixths Edward the pre system borders in
international border the US reacted by
be doing a US beat though worth bearing
in mind is a BB to one thing it doesn't
happen and for another thing it's wiped
out of history so try to find a
reference for anywhere son from the
margins or special review specialist
same thing happened 98 in others which
both under carter also
by the united states that meanwhile the
issue shifted the General Assembly were
similar resolutions are brought up
almost annually standard folks were
something like 150 to 250 one two three
sometimes dominica Marshall Islands
but essentially blocked by the u.s.
systematic review and because we're
after the press so a state not just John
Kerry circuit President Obama he has so
far made that one major foreign policy
declaration namely when he announced the
appointment of his the lilies negotiator
George Mitchell rendus which was
interesting it said that of course their
main concern in the region is the
security of Israel everything else is
secondary but they said there are
constructive moves coming from the Arab
side for the first time and he like
Kerry mentioned the Arab League peace
proposal is very constructive elements
in culture normalization of relations of
Israel and the art state should not
proceed to implement that and adding
very conceptual reconstruction and the
reorganization that means join us in
this alliance against Durant the real
enemy Obama intelligent person chooses
his words carefully surely knew that
that was not the Arab League proposal
they called for a two-state settlement
that the US alone has rejected for over
30 years and in that context
normalization so he was a mission of
that is a clear signal that he's
see us to continue with its
projectionists program have been very
rare departures from this derivative the
prayer and temper it's been a consistent
position and it's made very clear that
so I continued so ferry for example in
his speech that among other indications
that Israel finally has that partner for
peace that it's been desperately
earnings were is it not only arab states
that yes we want to normalize relations
with you but also the palestinians are
beginning to improve their age and
mentioned one example palestinians have
accepted a military force trip arm that
he wasn't restrained by a general baton
US general felt by Jermaine dictatorship
and that military force has proven that
it can that the Palestinian Authority
can finally act responsibly and he
explained every day during the gas
attack the US run the security horse was
able to prevent any expression of
sympathy for people in Gaza but
of the West Bank so they're doing the
job and that means they're beginning
back responsibly and maybe we can commit
them into the civilized world he also
said that of course Israel rested
there's some things to not just
Palestinians and the Arabs he said it
has to do with fries settlements what
does that mean well all the settlements
are criminal that's not even question in
fact Israel was informed by its highest
legal authorities back in 1967 that any
settlement in the occupied territories
is in violation of the Geneva Convention
the foundation of international monetary
law and they recognize that that's what
state suits are going to do it anyway
that was reiterated a couple years ago
by the World Court clean you its justice
and a separate declaration said that yes
the Geneva Conventions apply to the
occupied territories so when you hear
talk about Israel should remove its
illegal outpost that's meaning every
person there's they are illegal every
settlement is illegal and when Carrie
says you should freeze the settlements
he's saying continue the criminal
activity that is breaking up the West
Bank into a viable can tons and making
it possible any
meaningful Palestinian state there's
another aspect to freezing settlement
I'm sure Carrie doesn't know his animals
too like you can read about it than a
new report of excelling the Israeli
human rights organization just came out
a couple busy but one of the ways in
which is free settlements is by
expanding so put a brain the round which
takes in Palestinian land private land
and just keeping it pushing it as a call
to security barrier that you can do
anything didn't push it outward and of
course you have what's called natural
growth so 50 natural growth between
instead on the fringes of the city so
that's carries recommendation for the US
and Israel of course insists that the US
must not deal with Hamas they committed
a crime i stewed they want a democratic
election and that's not perfect in fact
as soon as is the only free election in
the Arab world really palestine january
2006 they won the election they weren't
supposed to so instantly the US issue
that initiated by myself in it for
putting the main way not the first time
and this is when i'm right alongside the
rhetoric about our loads of the mocker
he wishes Makka secret agenda so on and
so forth the US and Israel of course
initiate a program to punish the
Palestinians a serious program for
example us blocked European Union effort
to send to medical supplies pencils and
things of the together because maybe
they be used by come on like Israeli
prohibitions today they don't allow the
macaroni and it's where the paper in
because bombs with so that even
solicited a brief comment from Tori
Clinton but if it continues with so we
can't conceal them and of course as
always there's a pretext the pretext is
that Hamas doesn't accept three
conditions that we impose one that
recognize Israel to they have to
renounce violence and three they have to
accept previous agreements particularly
in this roadmap I the fact that he can
say that anybody can say that without
the press corps collapsing and ridicule
is pretty impressive I'm does the US
except those three conditions Aziz our
exhibit I have the US and Israel
renounce violence did they recognize
Palestine that they live live up the
past agreements like say the roadmap in
fact Israel immediately announced when
the roadmap
up here that wasn't our accepted the way
they did it this president ago we accept
that it's wonderful we had 14
reservations which completely
eviscerated in one of the merits of the
jimmy carter's book is that for the
first time he broke the silence on that
and it's no reviewer ever mentioned that
that was the one novel contribution
within the mainstream look he actually
had an appendix in which he gave 14
reservations which the US approved of
inside agreements and a perception
series of three settlements that's
another one so that's pilgrim solve the
israel-palestine problem mainly shifted
to put it to the side continued better
blocking of a political settlement good
morning the action mentioned in this
connection over one of the last thing
that the political settlement is
accepted by the entire world europe the
non-aligned countries that hamas
excessive for years Hezbollah your hands
of a except just the us-israel blocking
again constantly Obama this very same
the media can't talk about maybe don't
know more work done well what about it
ran Terry also taught that Iran he said
we can't take course the table of course
we want to negotiate with a friendly and
so on but one of the options is forced
it seems to bother nobody that the
threat of force is explicitly violation
of the foundations of international law
violation of UN Charter which bars the
threat or use of force in their national
affairs but we're about a moment is
supposed to have reached out his hand in
friendship he ran a couple of base
covered is never of snoozers message
what did he say actually he said well
have to talk to you but you have to meet
some responsibilities you have to give
up arms and violence and then again I'm
anybody here that and not collapsing
ridicule I mean Iran has to give up arms
and violence to prove whose military
budget equals that of the rest of the
world combined it's not the who carries
a digression regularly wait on the
borders of the rent in fact when was
around last guilty you said well it
doesn't matter if it tests more work for
us Joe Biden the vice
amplified this he said that will be
willing to deal with Iran if it accepts
our conditions in advance of negotiation
and has an ugly picture hangers he said
enough stop its illicit nuclear programs
why and of course in terror the weather
it's illicit nuclear program I mean
there was a it certainly protect the
Iranian Christian was not a glistening
that's how you ND designers a
non-proliferation treaty so it must be
if they were weapons program well there
was a national intelligence estimate
that November's in 2007 which concluded
after long deliberation that they don't
have a weapons program and haven't had
it for years Obama responded to that he
said yes that was what intelligence
decidedly rejected he also said nor they
need 11 his administration said we don't
have any good evidence we don't like it
so rejected so therefore whatever
they're doing is village heart as far as
terrorists concerned public regime of
that was plenty of term with what the US
is pointing to is their efforts to
alleged efforts probably true who is
this Hezbollah and Hamas to defend
themselves against the us-israeli
attacked that's terror in our lexicon
nobody's allowed to defend themselves
against air force or the force our
clients so that's terror in the
what is the world think about this what
would you read it's that constant rate
is that the international community has
demanded that I random stuff draining
the duration but who exactly is the
international community well what about
the majority of states in the world
which are been on a line moved where
they forcefully insistently support
Iran's right to enrich uranium as a sign
of the non-proliferation treaty so
they're not part of international
community what about the American
population a large majority of them
agree with an online but probably 75
percent chrn has this right so the
American populations are part of the
international the fact what the
international community is mr.
determines also always use is Washington
and whoever had to brew at moments
episode young they command that then
stop any kind of uranium enrichment
because we say that our intelligence
estimates is the opposite that they're
doing for weapons production and the
American opinion
this is kind of important for activists
it quite interesting other respects I'm
a large majority of Americans like
seventy five eighty percent think the
United States are the non-proliferation
treaty that means eliminate its bitter
weapons and corresponding majority
roughly eighty seventy five eighty
percent advocate any nuclear
weapons-free zone in the the beliefs
that means Iran Israel any US forces
people out there okay whatever problem
there may be could be mitigated and
probably overcome by lose in that
direction but that's not electoral
option telling the public that one said
well install stop depending everything
all of this without elaborating is
plenty of work for necklace want to
become a cage these issues like I said
about domestic financial issues that I
think bills talk about that
