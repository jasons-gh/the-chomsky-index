during the 1980's the Reagan
administration is responsible for
roughly 200,000 people slaughtered and
that doesn't mean just killed you know
that means tortured and mutilated and
raped I mean Paul Pott style tortured
that's pretty serious business hundreds
of thousands millions of refugees large
areas the country destroyed all of this
in an effort to block social reform the
Republicans attacked Dukakis as a
card-carrying member of the ACLU that's
a very interesting phrase that means an
organic card-carrying is of course means
real really communist no that's what
that's supposed to imply so here's an
organization that's committed to the
defense of the Constitution and
according to the Republicans that's
communists well you know I think that
characterizes modern conservatism it's
really a profoundly reactionary movement
which is deeply opposed to the values
that on which the country was
established I quoted the trilateral
commission view of the educational
system namely to system of
indoctrination of the young and I think
that's correct it's a system of
indoctrination of the young that was the
way the liberal elites regarded and
they're more or less accurate so the
educational system is supposed to train
people to be obedient conformist not
think too much do which told stay
passive don't cause any crisis a
democracy don't raise any questions and
so on that's basically what the what the
system is about Noam Chomsky concludes
his two part series analyzing the mass
media and American society right now on
alternative views
this will be the concluding section of
our two-part series featuring dr. Noam
Chomsky from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology one of America's foremost
critics of the mass media and American
Society Noam Chomsky is co-author of a
very good book on the mass media called
manufacturing consent and this program
he will mainly take questions from the
audience we also will present some
information from the progressive
magazine on mass media distortions and
now here is noam chomsky speaking from
of claire wisconsin in political
discourse every term has two meanings
you got to start by recognizing that so
democracy has an official meaning which
is something like you know the ability
of the public to take part and running
their own affairs or something but it
also has a technical meaning the one
that's actually used something is a
democracy if it's run by the business
classes if business runs it especially
business elements they're supportive of
us interests then it's democracy if not
it's not a democracy doesn't matter
nothing else matters virtually you'll
check you'll notice that this criterion
works quite perfectly for identifying
democracy same is true of the term peace
process it has a dictionary meaning in
the dictionary meaning a peace process
is some kind of process that's trying to
lead towards peace but it also has a
technical meaning the technical meaning
in its technical meaning it refers to
whatever the United States happens to be
advocating at a particular moment
wherever diplomatic initiatives the
United States is advocating that's the
peace process notice it follows that
it's a logical impossibility for the
United States to be opposed to the peace
process that's a nice consequence yet to
prove
the United States is for peace you don't
have to do any laborious inquiry into
the annoying facts because it's true by
definition since the peace process is
whatever the United States is up to the
United States always supporting peace
and the US enemies are always opposed to
peace because they're not supporting
what the US is up to and by definition
that means they're opposed to peace
you'll never find in the US media or for
that matter in u.s. scholarship for the
most part any such phrase as the United
States is opposing the peace process the
United States is trying to block the
peace process you can't find such
statements because they'd be logical
contradictions actually made this
statement and a talk in Seattle a couple
of months ago and there is a media
analysis group in the graduate school
there in a couple weeks later I got a
letter from somebody saying he was kind
of intrigued so he did a data based
study of the new york times over ten
years and he found i don't know like 900
references the peace process and checked
them all out and in fact there's not one
case where the united states was opposed
to the peace process it's pretty
remarkable because that was a period
when the united states was trying to
undermine the diplomatic negotiations
and settlement in Central America and in
the Middle East and so on notice that's
pretty remarkable even the most sublime
state you'd expect that it wouldn't
always be in favor of the police for
peace process maybe just by error or
misunderstanding but in the case of the
United States it's 100 I suspect it's a
hundred percent you might check and see
if you can find any exception and the
reason is it's just true by definition
since the priest process is whatever we
do now there are two major examples of
peace processes in process now one of
them's in the Middle East and ones in
Central America there's no time to go
through the details but if you look
you'll notice that in the Middle East
the United States has been trying to
block a diplomatic settlement for the
path of the arab-israeli conflict for
the past 20 years and it's still trying
to block it and in this is virtually
isolated in the world opinion that's
exactly what's going on now if you like
I'll give you some details I have a
detailed discussion of it then the
current issue of zeemagazine if you're
interested but I think it's quite clear
nevertheless
the discussion is the United States is
trying to advance the peace presses
there's another peace process going on
in Central America which is no less
interesting read you from the front page
of the New York Times today the lead
story in The New York Times today which
picked up on the airplane says US envoy
urges Hondurans to let the Contras stay
okay let them stay in Honduras the track
you come out and then comes a long story
and you turn to the second page the
continuation page and it says on its
face the administration proposal to keep
the Contras in place would seem to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
regional peace agreement which calls for
their relocation but administration
officials say there is no inconsistency
well that's about as close as you can
come you know on its face it seems to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
peace agreement well the peace agreement
is quite explicit the 1987 peace
agreement which the United States has
succeeded in undermining and destroying
says explicitly that the one
indispensable element in obtaining peace
in the region is the end of any form of
support logistical military
propagandistic etc for irregular forces
like the countries now it's not it
doesn't seem to be inconsistent with the
spirit but it's flatly inconsistent with
the words to keep the Contras in Prague
placed well the same is true of
everything else about that the there was
a there's that was the 1987 peace
agreement which the United States tried
to undermine and did undermine the
support of the media but there are
others there's a right now is the bait
going on on so-called humanitarian aid
to the Contras well the term
humanitarian aid has a meaning in fact
the World Court and its decision defines
humanitarian aid it you look up
paragraph 243 of the World Court
decision and it defines humanitarian aid
as aid given for the hallowed purposes
of the Red Cross namely to relieve human
suffering and crucially it says aid that
is
even without discrimination to civilians
on all sides of any conflict only under
such conditions that anything qualifies
humanitarian aid well that means all the
stuff given is called humanitarian aid
has nothing to do with humanitarian aid
its military but you'll never find this
discussed in the media I doubted he'd
find one reference to this in the media
so now we're talking about humanitarian
aid that's going to be voted Bush
administration hopes to keep the Contras
in place in violation of the 1987
agreement well it was also a Central
American presidents agreement just last
month and that said something to it said
the Contras have to be relocated away
from Honduras so this is flatly
inconsistent with that not the spirit
but the wording furthermore there was a
ceasefire agreement between Nicaragua
and the Contras last March over the deep
objections of the United States last
March twenty third and that ceasefire
agreement has some very specific terms
in it it says that aid can continue to
go to the Contras in cease fire zones
all of which are in Nicaragua when
provided by a neutral agency that's what
the wording of the agreement says
congress passed legislation right after
that sent to send what they call
humanitarian aid to the Contras but if
you look at the legislation it says
specifically that it must be in accord
with the ceasefire agreement and it must
be in accord with Central American peace
agreement well that means that the only
aid that Congress could legally send to
the Contras in accordance with its own
legislation is aid given by a neutral
agency like the Red Cross to Contras in
cease fire zones inside Nicaragua that's
not just my interpretation the ceasefire
agreement also specified an
international official in charge of
monitoring the agreement it's a
secretary general of the Organization of
American States he wrote a letter to
President Secretary of State George
Shultz stating that the aid that the
United States was sending was
inconsistent with the ceasefire
agreement and he was wanted to call the
attention of the Secretary of State to
this serious violation of the ceasefire
agreement and the Congressional
legislation
I was never reported Congress proceeded
to send the aid the neutral agency that
they selected was US aid State
Department subsidiary that's the US
that's the neutral agency and they're
sending it illegally to Honduras in fact
the aid that they're sending is not only
in can flatly inconsistent with the
Central American peace agreement it's
even in consistent with Congress's own
legislation that's pretty tricky you'll
never find one word of discussion about
this this is against the background of
years of the United States trying to
undermine every effort at political
settlement of that of those conflicts
whether they were through the contadora
group of Latin American democracies are
the United Nations or the Security
Council over the United States vetoed
resolutions calling on all states to
support international law and so on and
it continues but nevertheless according
to the media the press the United States
government is supporting the peace
process well I'm suggesting that
wherever you look if you look closely
you'll find exactly the same thing
you'll find quite a remarkable degree of
civility and subordination to establish
power particularly remarkable because
there's no force behind the there's no
authority that can impose force this is
willing subservience not compelled
subservience and the kind that in fact
flows I think just from the the logic of
the institutions for the reasons that I
mentioned well let me return finally to
a prediction of the propaganda model
that I mentioned already namely that
however well confirm that is it cannot
be part of the discussion it's kind of
got to remain outside the spectrum of
debate and respectable circles maybe
with some very marginal exceptions the
reasons are the ones I mentioned they're
pretty obvious that conclusion again is
quite well established empirically and I
think we may assume with fair degree of
confidence that that will continue to be
the case Noam Chomsky will take
questions from the audience later but
right now here is some information from
the progressive magazine featuring a
study by martin lee and Norman Solomon
from the organization fairness and
accuracy in media
and it's about the categories of
distortion from information from the
establishment media one category is
loaded language for instance one person
one group that might be struggling for
civil rights will be just engaged in
civil disobedience and the other end
will be labeled as terrorists another
example is that New York Times said that
Moscow is going to violate the us-soviet
treaty but when it came to the Americans
violating the ABM treaty they only said
that the Reagan administration was going
to reinterpret the treaty also they use
left-wing right-wing very interestingly
and with a great deal of of distortion
New York Times correspondence for
instance said in about the municipal
elections in Berlin both the extreme
left and the extreme right have gained
in the selection okay who was the
extreme right well it was the Republican
citizen party which was very racist and
very very right-wing but who was the
left-wing party and he was concerned
about the greens the little greens you
know the ecology pro-peace people and so
this was the this is the way the New
York Times distorts things you know
Suharto is moderate and the greens are
leftist and only a few of the nuttiest
reactionaries are right-wing whereas one
could argue that George Bush's right
wing that NBC is right wing and GE and
most of the corporations are advocating
policies that in an earlier age would be
seen as right wing to the right of any
moderate center that you can possibly
imagine well whoever is in power old we
usually designates themselves at the
center and anything to the other side of
it or badasses well there's another
distortion they of course they throw
around the word communist all the time
for people they don't want communist or
leftist or Marxist even calling the
Sandinistas communist in the New York
Times and
works all the time although they were so
far from it it was incredible number
they also talked about the budding
democracy in El Salvador that lovely
land of death squad they I always took
me to death in Vietnam or they say well
50 communist troops were killed and
injured today you never hear him talk
about the how many capitalist troops
were killed or injured and always a
communist how many counter-revolutionary
interventionist imperialist forces was
shot another category of distortion in
this article and aggressive is
unattributed assertions and suspicious
resource sources their references with
Dan Rather had an article in which he
said blood quint reports that the
Palestine Liberation Organization
conference in Algiers was orchestrated
by Moscow well where did he get that
information nobody said when they tried
to nail down Dan Rather on at CBS said
well that might have been a strong word
orchestrated by Moscow might have been
ill chosen well 150 million people
around my ever saw it and they didn't
make a retraction in point of fact the
networks are constantly conduits for
disinformation it's not just the CIA
that plant stories like Qaddafi was
going to assassinate Reagan remember
that one but the administration are
constantly feeding lies into the media
that then the media broadcast again
using his cover of unattributed two
sources I found out in the research I'm
doing on this book on a US television
the john mcwethy who is the ABC defense
and pentagon reporter has been a
constant source of disinformation for
years during the Reagan administration
there are so many leaks from the
government so coldly to you so many of
you consider plants because of just in
this information which the government
wants to get into the regular immediate
or they'll say well US intelligence
experts believe or CIA people think but
they don't say who it is
and so you can know exactly who's
pumping out this disinformation let's
return to Noam Chomsky as he takes
questions from the audience the first
one was about his opinion of PBS and the
ACLU the ACLU is an important
organization of the ACLU in fact became
the ACO you right at the time of the Red
Scare Wilson's Red Scare and in response
to that severe repression and since then
it has a pretty admirable record of its
conservative rec it's a conservative
organization very conservative the term
conservative is another one of those
that's been distorted out of any
relation to its meaning but in the real
sense of the term conservative the ACLU
is a conservative organization which is
trying to preserve basically
conservative values 18th century values
and it does a pretty good job on it it's
had bad periods it went along with
McCarthyism for example and it doesn't
take the really hard cases those are
taken by more militant civil rights
organizations but it has done very good
things it's very striking fact that
about the political system do you recall
what happened with the ACLU in the last
elections the Republicans attacked
Dukakis as a card-carrying member of the
ACLU that's a very interesting phrase
that means an organ card-carrying of
course means real really communist you
know that's what that's supposed to
imply so here's an organization that's
committed to defense of the Constitution
and according to the Republicans that's
communists well you know I think that
characterizes modern conservatism it's
really a profoundly reactionary movement
which is deeply opposed to the values
that on which the country was
established and that's why they would
call a an organization calling for the
defense of the Constitution a subversive
organization now what was the Democrats
defense against this charge that they
were that Dukakis supported the
Constitution his defense was to deny
that he supported I mean he didn't say
yeah of course I'm a member of the ACO
you and proud of it what he said is we
gave it they published a list of cases
of the ACOs that he disagreed with that
was the Republic
response well that tells you something
about a leet opinion i know i don't
think the ACLU is an illusion I think
it's an important organization I'm proud
to be a card-carrying member and to
speak at their meetings and stuff I also
think there are more courageous
organizations to take harder cases what
was the second question oh yeah public
broadcasting well public broadcasting is
an interesting case in a lot of
countries public broadcasting is tense i
mean how free public broadcasting is
public broadcasting is not subject as
much at least to business and to
corporate and advertiser pressures
however of course it's subject to state
pressures and how free and independent
public broadcasting is depends typically
on how free the state is not like in a
free society public broadcasting will be
free for many years the BBC was very
independent with Thatcher another
anti-democratic reactionary the BBC has
been become much more constrained
because the British government is also
imposing harsh constraints on freedom of
expression under Thatcher another's
mislabeled conservative but turning to
the United States public broadcasting is
very weak as compared with virtually any
other country any other democratic
country you know any of the you look at
the industrial democratic societies they
all have public broadcasting some of
them are only public broadcasting for
example in Israel is only a state TV in
England until recently there was only
state TV and now there's another channel
to other generals i think in canada fa
till recently there was only cbc there
may be another one now I forgotten but
that's common I mean those are major
channels and that's true of most
countries and how free they are depends
on how free the country is in the United
States they're very weak because here
things are run by corporations this is a
business run society and things supposed
to be under corporate control so public
broadcasting is very limited and in fact
it survives to a large extent on
corporate donations which is a
constraint Gulf and Western in one
famous case forced wnet TV in New York
to cancel a program on hunger simply by
saying they remove their Seban shin and
they submit and public broadcasting is
is you know it varies across the country
in the major centers like Boston and
Washington and New York it's very very
narrow it's in fact it's I think it's
more tightly censored in corporate radio
and television in other parts of the
country like you know Laramie Wyoming
and Des Moines Iowa and may be here it's
more free and that makes sense the same
is true of the commercial media because
in the ideological centers it's much
more important to control what people
think what they think out and then
sticks doesn't matter so much because
there's not much they can do about it
and as a result the it's more open I
mean I can see that myself if i go to
Laramie I get interviewed on public
television on public television but that
same conceiver chua Lee inconceivable in
blossom you know maybe a minute now and
then or something any interest of you
know fairness version but that and big
and the reason is that you know for the
main centers like say Boston are subject
to what's called the liberal bias
meaning tightly controlled by
ideological managers who know their
business and don't let things get out of
hand I think it's possible to put the
kind of pressures on public broadcasting
that can't be done on corporate media
but to that that requires organization
and real participation there are other
forms i should say one of the most some
of the most interesting and important
things are listener supported radio now
that's usually a small-scale operation
you know fly-by-night operation but the
very important that's really out of
corporate control or state control and
you can tell you travel around as i do
to communities and the ones that
listener supported radio are quite
different there's just an independent
culture that can sustain itself there
with people participating and you know
involvement of the community I mean it's
just much more democratic and that you
can see the results but that's you know
very limited resources because resources
lie essentially in the business
community another way they distort it is
to when they'll have a government source
adds credibility right to Secretary of
State or somebody like that but then
when they have non government sources or
critics they'll have somebody from a
foreign government that I have a Russian
or they'll have a sub Ortega from
Nicaragua but they don't show the people
in the United States who are progressive
critics of the US government they always
make it looks like it's those dirty
foreigners against the good old stars
and stripes so this is one way of
showing presence and when they do have a
point counterpoint he got to the third
stage where a MacNeil letter program
they had a thing on nuclear weapons
issues and who was the Dove they had was
old Sam Nunn giving the dovish point of
view in fact Frank fair that same group
that puts out this analysis that you're
reading has recently published a report
on the mcneil air show we're over a
nine-month period they documented who
the spokespeople were from the different
groups of the society on the program and
they documented that it's almost
primarily conservative groups and
spokespeople as corporate spokespeople
it's these conservative think tanks that
dock to dominate the special guest in
expert segments and there's almost no
labor union people environmentalists
public interest group people and no one
left the center's ever on there
supposedly i think it was there Jim lair
said he doesn't like moaners and whiners
from the left and so he gave his
producers instructions not to bring any
of those types on the program
and they did a case study for instance
of the Exxon Valdez story that during
the period they were monitoring the
macneil/lehrer program was one of the
big stories and they didn't have one
environmentalist on despite many special
segments on the show they would tend to
have the governor of Alaska Exxon
corporation spokesperson or a
congressperson that they never had
environmentalists on who you would think
would be the experts that could really
assess the impact of the oil spill on
the environment likewise when they have
a segment on Central America they rarely
have people from st. nicaragua or the El
Salvador left they always have these
right-wing conservative types here in
the US who are pontificating about
Central America and so you get a very
narrow spectrum of opinion on our public
television program the first cousin
category to what we're talking about in
this progressive article category is
stenography or journalism I thought it
was very interesting that the there was
an article in The Daily Texan where a
woman who was a journalism major she was
complaining because she said that a
journalism professor told her that her
job is mainly to be a quotation gatherer
well that's apparently what's the wasn't
use me do you like because they come up
there and they take down word-for-word
all the things these government
officials have to say even when they're
lies they don't check them out see if
their lies their statements are not
caught corroborated they just quote them
and put them before you on the evening
news and their little sound bites but
they don't balance this by getting some
of these other people on that we've been
talking about some of the other
progressives or critics from the
American of laughed or progressive point
of view another category is Kissinger
Haig disease it seems that David
Brinkley and meet the press space a
nation hot and Nightline they seem to
have those two
Martians recall anyway there they seem
they love the military and all the
bloodshed that they can cause but they
have Kissinger and Haig on time and time
and time again of course they don't tell
you that Kissinger has his own business
which is involved in a lot of these
activities which they're talking about
on the evening news in fact Frank we've
given the report that mother Jones has
about what Institute's what think tanks
in Washington provide the guest experts
for either Ted Koppel and the public
affairs discussion shows or the PBS
shows and it's almost always the
Heritage Foundation the American
Enterprise Institute or other of these
right-wing organizations and think tanks
occasionally you'll get the Brookings
Institute which is a very moderate
centrist think-tank giving some of its
experts on these programs but you never
have the institute for policy studies or
any of Nader's think tanks or any of the
left progressive organizations giving
their spokespeople most of whom have
academic credentials who have written
books who have PhDs who are college
professors whereas most of the people
that are the soundbite experts from the
American Enterprise Institute and the
Heritage Foundation have very minimal
academic credentials many of them don't
have PhDs many of them have not
published major brooks but they're taken
as the expert because they know how to
produce the sound bite the twenty-second
blurb that the networks are looking for
plus they're safe if you were leader of
the country on issues such as central
america and israel
you were the one that was making the
decisions how would you deal with the
problem in the Middle East now if I were
the leader of the country i probably
wouldn't do anything very much different
from anyone else no matter what I
believe and the reason is I would be
under such tight constraints from real
objective power that I just wouldn't
have any leeway there's good reasons
with but so let me instead of going into
that I go into that if you like but
instead of doing that let me answer your
first question what if let me take your
other way of formulating what do I think
we ought to do well I think there's some
pretty obvious answers both in the
Middle East and then at least there's a
general framework for obvious answers in
the Middle East and in Central America
in the Middle East there's been a very
broad international consensus on a
political settlement of the arab-israeli
conflict then there has been for many
many years that consensus for example
was expressed in a resolution that came
to the UN Security Council in January
1976 that's 13 years ago it called for a
two-state settlement establishment of a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip a settlement on the
internationally recognized borders
namely the pre June in nineteen sixty
seven borders and then it just repeated
the wording of un 242 the main UN
document with guarantees for the
independence and territorial integrity
of security of every state in the region
and it's right to live in peace and
security within recognized boundaries
and then it went on to discuss some
modalities you know for achieving this
end that's the basic framework of the
international consensus well that
particular resolution was vetoed by the
United States Israel refused to attend
the session the resolution was initiated
by the three major Arab state Syria
Jordan in Egypt three confrontation
States it was supported by the PLO in
fact it was openly supported by the PLO
according to the Israeli delegate who is
now the president of Israel it was in
fact prepared by the PLO notice that
that is worth noting this because that
means that already 13 years ago our
effort had gone exactly as far as he did
in that
his press conference on December 14th
which was alleged by the media to have
changed everything nothing changed he
just repeated the same position had been
saying for the last 13 years reasons why
the United States changed its position
but that's different this was ported by
the Soviet Union it was supported by
most of Europe it was supported by most
of the alliant non-aligned countries in
fact virtually by the entire world
that's why the United States had to veto
it alone well that's you could argue
about details but something like that is
a probably the only plausible least
interim settlement if you wanted to
pursue it seriously you'd have to talk
about economic relations of a federal
nature between the two states and all
sorts of other things and modalities to
secure it and so on and so forth but
that general idea has been a very broad
international consensus for years the
United States is alone virtually aside
from Israel and opposing it I mean not
totally alone like its supposed by
Qaddafi there are rejectionists aside
from the United States part there's
marginal groups around the world like
Khomeini you know the Afghan rebels I
mean a few other groups that oppose it
but primarily it's posed by the United
States that's why it doesn't get
anywhere now that has disappeared from
history on the assumptions of the
propaganda model that's not part of the
peace process why because the United
States was opposed to it and it's a
logical impossibility that the United
States should be opposed to the peace
process so therefore that to go on from
history when the United when the New
York Times or any scholarly monograph
for that matter reviews the peace
process they don't include this because
this is not part of the peace process
well that's only one example there are
many others and I think that's a general
framework for settlement as far as
Central America is concerned I think
it's pretty obvious what ought to happen
generally speaking I'm in the United
States has carried out major crimes in
Central America really major crimes in
the night I mean first of all our whole
history let Central America one
miserable areas of the world and it's an
area where US influence has been
enormous for a century well at once that
tells you something you know I me not to
think very hard to figure out what that
means and it's for reasons there are
reasons for it you look in the
details you can find out reasons for it
even the so called constructive programs
were actually lethal like take the
Alliance for Progress you know most of
our lot of what happened in Central
America is just because we impose
dictators and gangsters and terrorists
and so on if they ever try to get
independent as in Guatemala but every
once in a while there's something called
a constructive program the Alliance for
Progress is the famous case well I know
the Alliance for Progress was like a
plague for the worst plague that hit
central america until the reagan
administration that's killer isn't a
category by themselves the Alliance for
Progress first of all was a completely
cynical operation I mean the Alliance
for Progress was not instituted by the
Kennedy administration because they
suddenly discovered that there are poor
people in Central America and they knew
that all along it was initiated because
they were afraid that the poor people in
Central America were going to follow the
Cuban model now that means it began as a
purely cynical operation okay and that
showed the Alliance for Progress was
designed to impose on Latin America
altogether in fact an agro export model
they're supposed to shift production
from subsistence crops to export for the
benefit of us agribusiness in the
American market well ask consequences
for example it means that farmers in
Central America are expected not to
produce rice and beans for them people
locally to eat but asparagus and the
broccoli and flowers for yuppie markets
in the United States well for one thing
it means that I may need so I got to
import food which they import from us at
high costs which is good for American
agriculture subsidize usually by the
american taxpayer now subsidized by them
and it also means that and that food is
not going to be equally distributed it's
going to be distributed to the rich
furthermore the production is going to
be by the rich because it takes capital
inputs to produce the fancy fruits for
the American market so there's going to
be landless peasants furthermore they
going to produce beef in fact every
Latin American tral American country
beef production
moved up rapidly under the alliance for
progress while beef consumption reduced
and the reason is that ranchers moved in
often with North American connections
drove peasants off their land turned it
into grazing lands so they could send
beef to North American markets for
hamburgers great for Agrabah for
American agribusiness and for pesticide
and fertilizer manufacturers and for the
rich in Central America but not very
good for the people now you take a look
at you look to your favorite economics
book or latin american studies book and
they'll tell you that the Alliance for
Progress created an economic miracle
well you know from a certain point of
view it did a gross national product
went up all through Central America so
did malnutrition no and the reason is
obvious you drive people off the land up
in the hills and you take over their
land and you produce beef for export and
fancy Crocs it's good for the gross
national product just means the people
starve in fact the crisis of the 1980s
is largely caused by that plague well
let's just take the 1980s during the
1980's the Reagan administration is
responsible for roughly 200,000 people
slaughtered and that doesn't mean just
killed you know that means tortured
mutilated and raped I mean Paul Pott
style torture that's pretty serious
business hundreds of thousands fact
millions of refugees large areas the
country destroyed all of this in an
effort to block social reform in all
three major countries where we were
involved in Honduras and El Salvador and
Nicaragua now that's serious what should
we do well the first the first thing we
do is stop torturing them a second thing
we should do is pay reparations because
we own and and after that maybe there's
some hope that they could reconstruct
from the damage we've done to them I
think that's what we ought to do try to
find anybody suggesting that in the
mainstream however you can't express
this view not because it's false but
because it's true and if you look into
it you'll find that it's true I think
now what should we do
I mean let's go back well we should do
we are free to act plenty of things that
we can do one thing we can just provide
eight ourselves you want to wait for the
state to order you to provide aid they
need it badly I mean nicaragua's really
the hurricane last October was the final
blow they're gonna have mass starvation
there now the government of course is
delighted the US government they won't
send them a penny because they want them
to suffer as much as possible but
American citizens are much more
independent and in fact they've raised a
lot of money for example there's one
small Jesuit center in North Carolina or
Virginia or some worthy quest for peace
scrolled the Quixote a center a little I
think they too have three staff members
or something they've raised millions of
dollars from people in the United States
who are able to think for themselves who
weren't just slaves of power and those
are things that can be done you can help
people survive and you can have to all
put pressure on on Congress on the media
to do something about this a lot of ways
of doing that weighs all sorts of ways
ranging from civil disobedience to
writing letters to the editor to you
know mass popular organization you know
they're not going to put you in jail for
it and that since a very free country
which means if you don't do it you have
a lot more responsibility than if you
don't do it in a place where you are
afraid that you're going to be repressed
so there's no shortage of things to do
it's just a matter of willingness to do
them and the willing is to do them
begins with a willingness to recognize
reality that's the hardest part I think
once you recognize reality won't have
any more questions about what to do
because too obvious so the first thing
to do is to recognize the reality now it
takes a little work but once you
recognize it I think it's obvious what
to do another category in the article in
the progressive is passive phrases
glossed over euphemisms shows how for
instance New York Times said that
salvador allende's policies in 1972-73
era before the coup and Chile the end
his policies caused chaos which brought
in
the military kind of obscuring the fact
of his a US government particularly the
CIA and US corporations like I T&T which
fomented the chaos in the first place
and the notion of the chaos prompted the
military of the Chilean government to
move in a restore order really was
rather downplays and neutralizes the
American role and also the brutality the
coon which people later tens of
thousands were jailed tortured
disappeared and just plain killed well
in turkey Turkey has been an invisible
record of on civil rights they've
tortured people murdered people
incarcerated trade unionists and it's
it's been horrible in Turkey but the
Washington Post said that they call
these controversial measures and turkeys
military despot pursued a quote
down-to-earth approach as he sought to
deal with a rough and tumble of everyday
politics ruffin Thompson murder and
torture rough and tumble weather Miami
Herald had an article to they mentioned
this category there was that it was head
like chemo phobia may be as bad as
chemical saying that the people who are
trying to fight the chemicals that are
in our food and in the air are really
bad because being afraid of those good
chemicals is really harmful the woman
who wrote it said that the best
scientific estimates which he didn't
specify say that ninety-nine point nine
percent of carcinogens and the diet come
from natural sources which she didn't
identify she said the synthetic
chemicals account for only 0.01 percent
of the carcinogens which the Americans
consume none of this none of this was
had any identification or source for any
of these assertions there's been quite a
bit of this talk about so-called camo
phobia yeah this is the corporations are
pushing this big the other thing that
the big polluters are doing who
are producing chemicals and wastes and
different things that are pesticides
that are poisoning environment and our
food they're producing these PBS nature
shows for their pedants penance for
their crime and fair in their latest
edition of extra their newsletter has a
list of the biggest chemical polluters
in the world and their crimes and the
penance that is the PBS series that they
fund so BA BASF that's one of Europe's
most energetic toxic dumpers it funds
the PBS program adventure Chevron which
is California's largest petrochemical
polluter funds the PBS program National
Geographic special DuPont the major
chemical polluter the world's largest
producer of ozone eating chemicals
produces discoveries underwater
georgia-pacific which is a clear cut
timber and paper mill polluter produces
forever wild about the environment and
on and on and on through the biggest
polluters their crimes and the whole
series of PBS nature programs that they
produce that very rarely talk about
pollution and some of the problems of
these corporations destroying the
environment so this is the way they buy
protection by controlling the PBS
programs about nature and the wilderness
and making sure that their crimes are
not investigated when I graduate I'm
going to be a history teacher history
teachers what do you suggest in high
school what do you suggest I do in that
context to perpetuate well you know
that's really important you know a lot
of people I suspect many of you if you
think of your own experience I know me
you can remember cases where a teacher
really made a terrific impression on you
I mean most schooling is just trained
training for stupidity and conformity
but every once in a while and that's
institutional to their reasons for that
but occasionally you know you get a
spark somebody will challenge your mind
you know make you think encourage you to
think and so on
tremendous effect you know you just
reach all sorts of people of course if
you do it you're going to be you may
very well have problems you have to
tread a narrow line there are plenty of
people who don't want students to think
they don't they're afraid of the crisis
of democracy you know people start
thinking and you get all these problems
I was quoting at the beginning you know
they won't have humility enough to
submit to a civil rule no I'll start
trying to press their demands in the
political arena or they'll you know have
ideas of their own instead of believing
what they're told and privilege and
power typically doesn't want that so
they can react and the high school
teacher who tries to get students to
think may find the repression firing and
so on said a lot about the role of the
media in a so-called down democracy I'm
wondering how you see the role of our
educational system what it's doing right
now what forces are driving it and what
constraints are on it and how should it
operate well I quoted the trilateral
commission view of the educational
system namely it's a system of
indoctrination of the young and I think
that's correct it's a system of
indoctrination of the young that was the
way the liberal elites regarded and
they're more or less accurate so the
educational system is supposed to train
people to be obedient conformist not
think too much which told stay passive
don't cause any crisis a democracy don't
raise any questions and so on that's
basically what the what the system is
about even the fact that the system has
a lot of stupidity in it I think has a
function you know it means that people
are filtered out for obedience if you
can guarantee lots of stupidity in the
educational system you know like stupid
assignments and things like that you
know that the only people who make it
through our people like me and like most
of you I guess who are willing to do it
no matter how stupid it is because will
we want
and go to the next step you know so you
may know that this assignment is idiotic
and the guy up there couldn't think his
way out of a paper bag but you'll do it
anyway because that's the way you get to
the next class and you want to make it
and so on and so forth well there are
people who don't do that you know there
are people who say I'm not going to do
it is too ridiculous you know those
people are called behavioral problems or
something like that they end up in the
principal's office or in the streets or
selling drugs or whatever and all of
this is a technique for selection for
obedience and I have I don't how to
prove this but I have a feeling that
when you go to the elite universities
you find more obedience and conformity
probably because you're getting the
students who were better able to do it
well all of that is functional that's
the way it works but it and it works
right through graduate school I mean if
you Dierks how do you get the graduate
school it's already a little more varied
because some real contradictions develop
in the system the problem is that you
can't have progress this way no now
especially in the sciences and
engineering that's a problem because the
corporation's need science and
engineering you know if you don't have
innovation you're really in trouble so
they have to encourage creativity and
independence because you can't get
anywhere if you just copy what somebody
told you you have to be challenging
things all the time challenging
everything you know thinking new
thoughts and so on and there you got a
real contradiction it's hard to train
people to be creative and challenging
and so on and yet to ensure that
somewhere else in their lives they're
conformist and obedient and never think
so you have problems that's a serious
problem in Japan dentally we think of
Japan as this tremendous superpower but
that's very misleading Japan for example
it's very poor in science for example
and they're aware of it and part of the
reason is it such as part of it it's
part of the same thing that makes them
good workers obedient workers it's a
very obedient society very differential
and conformist society and one effect of
that is that you you know there are real
constraints against independent fries
and thinking
and you see it in the sciences very
clearly the but it's a problem here too
so there are those contradictions when
you get to graduate school they're
beginning to show up they show up much
less in the ideological subjects because
they're it doesn't matter so much if
people have you know there isn't the
profits aren't made by historians having
original ideas about the French
Revolution so they can have conventional
ideas and that means that the the
pressure to try to support innovation
and freedom is much less and the
professor the pressures for conformity
on the other hand are much greater
because in the ideological subjects it
begins to be dangerous if people think
the wrong thoughts it's not so dangerous
if they have new ideas about physics so
so you but nevertheless you know you
begin to get a little flux in the system
by the time you get to graduate school
and even at lower levels you find it I
mean there's you know there are teachers
who do stimulate thought and sometimes
they get away with it and all the way
through you know if people are learning
things you just you just can't control
you can't make them just regurgitate
what they heard now there's a lot of
pressure to turn the schools into the
Marine Corps and there's a lot of
support for it for example there's this
bestseller last couple of years by Allen
bloom that was all over the
supermarket's closing the American mind
yeah which ever you know huge bestseller
supermarket racks which is where I read
it and things like that well you take a
look at what he's saying and it was
plenty you know a lot of enthusiastic
accolades for it and so on he was saying
that a couple of smart guys will decide
what the great thoughts are and every
student will memorize them and that's
education okay well you know I mean
that's a way to turn people into pure
automata I mean even if they happen to
pick the great thoughts there is no way
less likely to get anybody to think
about those thoughts than to make that
the curriculum that finishes them off no
but and I think that's the purpose
really i mean the purpose is just to
impose a fire
you know here's the great thoughts all
this other stuff is rubbish just learn
those you're okay I'll pick them you
memorize them that's basically the line
now of course that's that's the opposite
of Education that's the way you study
Talmud or something like that but it's
very popular and I think it reflects the
same concern over the crisis of
democracy faq Ellen was it bloom himself
was extremely the incident that really
got to him was a case in cornell where
he was a professor where some black
students took over one of the administer
one of the buildings and he was he said
that's just like the knots you know the
fact of the Nazis his old business about
the nazis and so on and so forth well
you take a look at what happened and
that kidding tell you what he thought
the and he says the faculty capitulated
you know just like Heidegger capitulated
to the Nazis and so on what actually
happened if you look back is that there
were real grievance is undoubtedly their
students shouldn't have done that they
did go into the building with guns and
so on but it was settled very amicably
it was settled amicably nobody was
killed the ingredients is worth to some
extent dealt with and the net result was
better than it was before but he didn't
tell you what he thought they should
have done but it's sort of implicit I
mean I guess they should have bombed the
place or something like that but that's
what really set him off and in general
what set many people off was the you
know the the 60s are now described in
the literature as if it was a time when
students were running around burning
libraries and you know destroying the
foundations of civilization and so on
what was actually going on is they were
asking questions you know they were
raising questions they were looking into
things that people hadn't looked into
before they were not just obedient and
from the point of view of a lot of the
faculty that's equivalent to burning the
buildings we can't even that small
distinction you can't make that and this
pressure to turn the school's back to
the days when you didn't have to worry
about those things like disobedient
students asking questions about things
that you didn't tell them to think about
and so on the last category of media con
game article in the progressive by
martin lee in norman solomon is the
numbers racket first any of you have
been in
ministrations have seen this before
where the media will say all if it's
somebody they don't like them well it'll
just be a small number and the cops will
always underestimate what the organizers
and and other people who participated in
particular thing say really happened for
instance there was a story in New York
Times at fifteen thousand Jews and
Palestinians join Jerusalem peace rally
people who saw the peace rally who were
there said there had to be at least
35,000 the organization peace now said
this also another way they distort the
during the mid 80s the State Department
always kept saying and the the media
always just do to fleece repeated their
quotes that they're between 2500 and
3500 Cubans in Nicaragua as military
personnel and they eventually up that up
to thirty thirty-five hundred to five
thousand Cubans in Nicaragua well when
Raphael del pino Diaz defected to the
United States in nineteen eighty seventy
said now there are only been 300 to 400
Cubans in Nicaragua and that was the
number which the Cubans and the
Nicaraguans have been saying all along a
more significant way of media distortion
in this numbers racket category that's
when they start talking about
unemployment because the bureau of labor
statistics releases these figures which
you hear repeatedly all the time on the
news but they really hide the true
extent of unemployment for instance not
counted our people without jobs who
haven't looked for a job in over a month
because the prospects are discouraging
and they're all so they don't count in
it people who retire early they don't
they count in the people as being
employed who only worked one day a week
you can't hard live on that but
nonetheless that counts as somebody
who's employed but the bureau of labor
statistics actually puts out another
report called the u7 rate which factors
in all these other things we just
mentioned the discouraged employment the
early retirees so it's a much much
considerably greater
more accurate figure than the one you
get on regular media so in 1986 when the
media reported the average national
unemployment rate with 6.2 percent the u
7r eight which the journalists ignore
was fourteen point three percent and
that was much more accurate but of
course that would have everybody all up
near and excited they don't want you
that Miss country got to keep the people
cool so what's the worth of all the news
you get from the media particularly on
television British journalist named Ed
Harriman says despite the wonders of
communications technology the news often
seems little more than folklore a steady
stream and nursery tales for adults and
that's the end of this alternative views
I'd like to thank Laurie Lachlan Melissa
Crowley and Michael Faris for their
editing assistance of this program also
Pawlikowski and Jim dickerson who
provided the tape with a speech of Noam
Chomsky from Eau Claire Wisconsin
