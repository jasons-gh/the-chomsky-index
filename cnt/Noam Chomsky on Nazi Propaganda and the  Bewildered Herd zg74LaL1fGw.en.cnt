yeah that's more things that Alex Gary
brought out in his work
water liftman was the leading public
intellectual of the 20th century very
prestigious and a progressive yeah he's
he was a Wilson Roosevelt Kennedy
liberal you know on the progressive side
and very much held in the liberal
intellectual circles a great figure and
but he did have a seasoned democracy
which he hated hated in few democracy as
it leads to generally this is not the
way he's depicted but it's very
transparent in his essays Alex quotes a
lot early
one of the things he said is with you
just quoted that the policy-making has
to be limited to the responsible men
he's of course wondering everyone who
propounds these theories is one of the
responses in there so we responsible men
small group of people without special
insight or understanding we have to be
able to make decisions and we have to be
free of the trampling in the roar of the
bewildered fairy the water creditors the
population so the general population he
went goes on to say have to be
spectators not participant in his words
they have to be put in their place they
are the population they're called
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders they
have nothing to do with decision making
so you've got to keep them out there
somewhere and when he was writing this
is 1920 this is really the days of the
origins of the huge propaganda system
it's not called propaganda in the United
States it's called the Public Relation
system or advertising or some word like
that it's a straight propaganda system
and that's understood by of it so if we
can for gurbles who ran the Nazi
propaganda system
it was very frank about it he said we're
taking over the techniques of American
commercial advertising their propaganda
system and they did it and they did it
pretty well after the Bolsheviks tried
to take it over to but they were
normally better to embed afina Rutan
propaganda system but they're Nazis
relearning efficient did it well and it
was American commercial advertising and
the idea is to see if you can as the
business press put it at the time we
have to somehow direct people through
the superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption and if you do
that the responsible men us will be
protected from the ignorant and
meddlesome Outsiders without their
commodities going the debt is almost
instinctive and it's not over if done in
fistic ated way here but it's done in
many systems so for example to take a
different case when when the British
ended slavery they had Colin you know
that slave colonies in the West Indies
to make it in places like that and there
was a problem it was discussed in the
British Parliament what are we going to
do the plantations that when these
slaves are free there's a lot of land
around them they'll go off into the
hills little games over plot of land and
live happily ever after the slaves in
the plantation they the same idea they
said what we have to do is get them
trapped into debt consumption system if
we can convince them with corporate web
patient propaganda in those days not
corporate propaganda to live feels that
they have to have these commodities you
know wish that I'll get at the company
store and go into debt let me freeze in
the crap the United Fruit Company 50
years later that hit on exactly the same
policies in the Caribbean there were
freed slaves coming over from from the
Caribbean islands to the Atlantic coast
of Costa Rica with a banana plantation
and so on and the ideas well how can we
enslave these people what they'll just
kill welcome to the land there's plenty
of land and they'll be fine and same
idea that we got it in we got a instruct
that make them believe that it's
necessary to have silk stockings and
Stetson hats this isn't a quasi traffic
women have to have silk stockings and at
this that's a fact get him at the
company store you know you finish these
methods and it's just turned into a
sophisticated system by the major
propaganda but the our system here it's
quite striking that the huge growth of
public relations propaganda was in the
freest most democratic society it was in
England in the United States it was
picked up by others later like say the
Nazis in the world but they're basically
invented here and there's a reason for
it
you go back to roughly the time of the
First World War the British Conservative
Party the growing court protect
appearance or they recognized that
people had won enough rights so it was
hard to control them by force there were
parliamentary Labour Party's there were
unions women which wasn't going to get
the franchise it's just hard to control
people so if you can't control them by
force as you could in the past you have
to control them some other way otherwise
you'll get this evil demon of democracy
growing which is a threat to privilege
so how do we control them if you can't
control them by force by controlling
attitudes and please it's almost
automatic so then put your resources
into propaganda systems and in fact in
the 1920s it was actually choral
propaganda so Edward Bernays the sort of
the public relations industry his main
book them it was called propaganda it
was Frank by the 1930s term propaganda
begun to get bad connotations
not too so so the term propaganda that
was dropped you don't quarterly
propaganda anymore but now you call it a
free press or something like that and
that's the same thing and if you read
bearnaise this book also in the nineteen
twenties it's the same as lifting one
same words an intelligent minority must
make the decision the rest of the
population has to be diverted something
somehow also they don't interfere for
their own good of course you could turn
through with President Obama's favorite
philosopher my whole neighborhood
another perspective the commentator
highly respected his view around the
same time was that people are kind of
stupid and will harm themselves and like
a three-year-old running out into the
street can't read it through that you
hold it back and therefore we have to do
is feed people necessary illusions and
emotionally potent oversimplifications
it's practically a definition of the
corporate media yeah don't even have to
get examples open front pity necessary
illusions emotionally potent
oversimplifications
divert them to the superficial things of
life or frighten them that's another
thing that that fear is a very effective
technique of control of people by the
longer power and these measures used
over and over again whether it's a
British plantations of the early
nineteenth century or in front pages
today last election for example it's a
kind of instinctive and natural and
understandable
