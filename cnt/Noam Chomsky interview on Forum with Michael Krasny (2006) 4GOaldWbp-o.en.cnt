the New York Times called noam chomsky
arguably the most important intellectual
and the Boston Globe has referred to him
as America's most useful citizens
certainly intellect and radical activist
citizenship have been hallmarks and
touchstones to a career in the public
eye of one of the world's foremost
linguistic experts the creator of
generative grammar and longtime MIT
professor now emeritus of linguistics
and philosophy in addition to his
pioneering work in linguistics Noam
Chomsky is the author of numerous
best-selling political works including
America and the new mandarins hegemony
or survival and imperial ambitions his
newest book is called failed States the
abuse of power and the assault on
democracy and he joins us for this
morning's second hour of forum from
Wellesley Massachusetts and a phone line
that we hope is going to hold now I'm
good to have you back after all these
years so welcome very good to be here I
guess I'd like to start where you start
you start with Bertrand Russell and
Albert Einstein in your new book and you
get into something that as you say isn't
probably talked about enough and that is
the nuclear threat by quoting those two
and their concern about keeping the
planet and making sure that aggression
and all the sort of things that lead to
volatility don't happen as much as we
can stave them off what I'm wondering is
especially since you mentioned people
like Graham Allison is the increased
nuclear threat and you mentioned for
example militarization of space is the
increased nuclear threat because of the
United States as you seem to imply
largely and even more so than it is with
North Korea Iran or bin Laden well yeah
in terms of scale there's just no
question of the the u.s. is and this I
think is just the consensus among
strategic analysts and there's more less
obvious from looking at it the u.s. is
far in the lead and escalating the
serious threat of nuclear war I mean you
can just take a look at the quotes I
give and the sources I say which are
from right in the mainstream there's a
serious threat from from North Korea
from Iran and conceivably from al Qaeda
but in large measure we're responsible
for escalating those threats for example
why would
say take Iran which is in the case of
al-qaeda the major threat is that they
will somehow obtain well conceivably a
missile but possibly material that can
be used for nuclear weapons where
they're going to go well one of the
places they might get them and they have
them in fact is from the invasion of
Iraq the discussed there the you talk
about the looting in your book you know
I mean this is a system there were means
developed with weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq it was known they
were under supervision of UN inspectors
and being dismantled when Rumsfeld and
Wolfowitz sent their troops in
inspectors were kicked out they didn't
bother safeguarding them and they were
systematically looted systematically UN
investigators continued to inspect and
so forgive me there were WMDs as you
point out yes they were there they were
being dismantled also means the
development like precision high-tech
precision equipment for that could be
used for developing nuclear weapons they
were systematically looted not by
individuals and we can only imagine and
fear where that went to but nevertheless
that's a pretty remote grip Linda be is
likely excuse me that they could go to
the former Soviet Union or Pakistan
though Pakistan is most likely that's
been the center of the Soviet Union
doesn't want to but Pakistan has been
the center of the majors smuggling
operations for years and where did the
Pakistani nuclear weapons come from well
Reagan administration the Reagan
administration pretended year after year
I stress to pretend that that Pakistan
was not developing nuclear weapons they
knew it was it was in fact and one of
their leading nuclear weapons developers
became the center of a major
distribution network sending the parts
and material for nuclear weapons all
over the place tech say North Korea and
there was an agreement
one of the good things that Clinton did
was a framework agreement which in which
North Korea was to stop its nuclear
weapons-related activity as apparently
it did as far as anyone knows I in
return to for actions by the United
States like water reactor or other
things
neither side totally lifts up to its
obligations the u.s. included but when
Bush came in he just abandoned or said
no we're not going to do this okay look
ago they went back to developing nuclear
weapons as everyone predicted can it be
dealt with young similar ways Iran is a
more striking case Iran as far as anyone
knows is living is operating within the
framework of the non-proliferation
treaty and they have something secret
going on and there's reasons for
suspicions about that but it's not known
however Iran has repeatedly offered to
negotiate all of these issues in 2003
for example Iran this is under the
moderate Hitomi government but with the
support of the hardline clerics they
offered to negotiate all outstanding
issues including nuclear issues
including a two-state settlement for the
Arab Israel or Palestine conflict the
everything the Bush administration
didn't respond it just centered the
Swiss diplomat who had brought the
office well those offers have been
repeated including the two-state
settlement and they're just ignored the
well that's a good way of accelerating a
conflict the Iran did make a an
arrangement a deal with the European
Union in which 2004 in which they agreed
to suspend their legal perfectly legal
uranium enrichment program
they said they'd suspend them and in
return the European Union was to provide
phrasing was firm guarantees on security
issues well we all know what that means
security issues refer to the us-israeli
threats to attack Iran those threats
themselves are serious violations of
international law and Iran rightly wants
some kind of guarantee there won't be
attacked
well the bush administration refuses the
European Union couldn't live up to its
side of the bargain
so finally Iran dropped the bargain -
and be returned to enriching the uranium
the way that's described in the West
mostly here almost universally is that
Iran broke the agreement but that's you
know it's not exactly the story well
there they say they're willing to go
back to it last January they again made
a similar offer now they're willing to
negotiate now the US has slightly
shifted its position and this is
described in the press as a great shift
towards moderation and negotiation but
take a look at it the US has agreed to
negotiate if you but it is unwilling to
withdraw the threat so it's willing to
negotiate under that's you know at the
point of a gun it's not a negotiation
furthermore it's willing to negotiate on
the condition that Iran agrees in
advance to the desired outcome namely
permanent suspension of uranium
enrichment well you know that's maybe
even sell that in the press but that's
not a serious offer what about the
narrative we're getting in the press
here though that Iran essentially not
only wants to destroy Israel its Prime
Minister has said that the Zionist
entity should be annihilated or words
that have been at least from Farsi
perhaps interpreted to mean that and
they have certainly armed Hezbollah for
that purpose
well the West in the u.s. in particular
loves the ravings of Montana Judd and
they're very widely publicized but he
has a superior the what's called this
what they call the supreme leader the
Ayatollah Khamenei II who was the was in
charge and probably in a reprimand to a
mod integer he repeated last June I
think it was the he repeated the Iranian
proposal to accept the two-state
settlement to the Arab to the Palestine
Israel or conflict the way he put it was
that Iran accept the position of the
Arab League on this issue well the
position of the Arab League is the 2002
Arab League agreement to a Saudi plan
Palestinians also agreed the plan was
for full normalization of relations with
Israel if it accepts the international
consensus on a two-state settlement
well that's Iran that's the superior to
Medina Judd I don't think that was
published anywhere but it's a far more
important I mean in the mainstream at
least it's far more important statement
then I'd any judge and it's been
reaffirmed so you can read in the London
Financial Times that it was reaffirmed
by an Iranian diplomats a couple of
weeks ago
well the west dozen want to hear that
what about arming Hezbollah has bout
Hezbollah is regarded in Lebanon it's in
Lebanon it's just called the resistance
let's take a look at this morning's
newspapers they conceded by now it's the
resistance do they want to destroy
Israel coastal as leader and nasrallah
has said explicitly that he doesn't
regard Israel as a legitimate state and
as well I won't accept it but if the
Palestinians accept a two-state
settlement that's you'll go along they
won't disrupt it says it's a Palestinian
issue whatever the Palestinians accept
they will accept they are a Lebanese
organization and they deeply integrated
into Lebanon and they want to solve the
problems of Lebanon and in the way that
they prefer talking with Noam Chomsky
his new book is called failed States the
abuse of power and the assault on
democracy the thesis of your book Noam
Chomsky seems to be that the u.s. is a
terrorist State under its own definition
and it doesn't comply with the universal
law in other words following the
principles that it expects out of other
nations you also call it a failed state
because of something you described as
democratic deficit that public opinion
is not reflected by public policy it
goes back I think in many ways does it
not to some of your earlier work where
you say public policy is shaped by media
but nevertheless people sort of in some
ways really come above that plenty of
others have been writing about this for
a long time but it is reaching pretty
extreme levels in this book in fact I
run through some of the recent the kind
of public opinion studies that we've
taken right before and right after the
2004 election and they're pretty
striking they show a dramatic gap
between public policy and public opinion
that's one of the reasons why the party
managers made it were very careful to
ensure that issues would basically be
off the agenda in the 2004 election it
would be restricted to what the PR
industry calls qualities personality or
something like that and most of the
public just remain totally unaware of
the positions of candidates on issues so
it takes a another Kyoto Protocol as an
example as you know the government
including the near unanimous Senate
Democrats to rejected the bush
administration said it's gone it's all
gone finished forever
newer than the public supports it so
strongly that a majority of bush voters
assumed that he supported it that's only
one example give a long list they're
just quoting the public opinion studies
what's happened is that roughly speaking
both political parties are pretty far to
the right of the general population on a
host of serious issues and these figures
are particularly striking because public
opinion is constructed almost person by
person the people are not repeating what
they read or what they hear because they
don't hear it and they all read it but
what we read is of red states and of
evangelicals who take conservative
positions and support the president's
policies and all that many of them do
not all of course but a majority they
met do locals do and they have been
mobilized as a political force but
that's not majority the population if
you take a look at popular attitudes on
peace key on International Affairs on
international crises which should take
the lead on difficult war on terrorism
on domestic issues like health care on
and on it's just pathetically different
I mean one of the striking examples was
the major study of public opinion right
after the federal budget was announced
in February 2005 first federal budget of
the second Bush administration there was
a major study by program on
international policy attitudes the most
respected polling institution public
attitudes were almost the opposite of
the budgets budget whereas the budget
was going up for public one of them the
good it to go down by large majorities
military spending supplemental for iraq
and afghanistan and so on where spending
was going down the public wanted to go
up also by very large majorities health
education welfare renewable energy
you support for the United Nations just
right through a long list actually I
quote the results there
well those and another useful comment
about this is that the results that were
apparently not reported a friend of mine
who does database searches checked
carefully it couldn't find a single
report in any American newspaper a very
dramatic information information that
says the public is completely opposed
radically opposed to to the federal
budget meaning public policy and the
same has been true on occasion after
occasion that's a serious problem inside
the United States talking with Norm Chow
ski again his new book has failed States
the abuse of power and the assault on
democracy you mentioned Michael Shire
who's been on this program leading us
terrorist specialists and talk about his
view which is I think pretty much your
view that once again the policies of the
invasion of Iraq and which you pretty
much linked to oil and but have
increased the threat of terror
of course President Bush has said
publicly it's better to fight the
foreign forces and the terrorists on
their own turf meaning Iraq presumably
but as you point out in the book you got
about five to maybe ten percent only of
forces from outside of Iraq come on II
that I also point out there quoting
Anthony Cordesman and other terrorism
specialists but according to Israeli and
Saudi intelligence who were the most
informed that five to ten percent are
almost entirely people who had no no
earlier records they were mobilized by
the attack on Iraq quote other terrorism
specialists who actually I think there's
a near consensus on this who pointed out
that the I arrived Bush is now fighting
terrorists in Iraq but he created them
they weren't there before
it's an incubator for training
terrorists it's an incubator for
training terrorists the CIA's conclusion
I too was the warning as well the same
intelligence agencies and
terrorism specialists who are now
reporting and lamenting the sharp
increase in terror caused by the war in
Iraq but before the war they were
warning of the same thing and we didn't
need them to figure it out it's obvious
this is going to happen and so it seems
gonna happen then almost surely is going
to be the result of the u.s. Israeli
invasion of Lebanon it's creating the
generations of radical Islamist jihadist
you bring a lot of history to bear in
the book some of it fascinating I mean
early on when you talk about the Cuban
Missile Crisis and how close even by a
word we came to actually a nuclear
threat but also later on talking about
the invasion of Iraq and the historical
precedent going back to Jackson that is
President Jackson Andrew Jackson and
John Quincy Adams the Secretary of State
is fascinating well actually the reason
I bring that up is because the majors
there's one major scholarly book by John
Lewis Gaddis a well-known respected yale
historian who if the book is about the
roots of the Bush Doctrine which he
approves of I mean criticizes tactics
but basically approves us so that's the
major scholarly book on the roots of the
Bush Doctrine he starts with Andrew
Jackson and the Seminole Wars and John
Quincy Adams and what I did in reviewing
it is just point out the facts which he
ignores from his own sources I mean
using his own sources the right
scholarly sources I just report what
they in fact say it's almost the
opposite of his conclusions and in fact
what they say is correct that probably
is the roots of the Bush Doctrine and
it's shocking and dangerous the idea
that a war can be fought without
congressional approval not partly that
and Adams in fact recognized with regret
later in his life but this had
established the precedent of wars fought
in violation of the Constitution
executive wars but much more serious
than that is the principle which again
is actually recognizes and emphasizes he
said the Adam
Jackson war which was the conquest of
Florida and the destruction of the
Seminoles what they called the lawless
Indians and runaway slaves the that the
principle behind it as he says was that
expansion is the path to security so if
you want security you have to expand
well that's that is a doctrine and that
is the Bush Doctrine except now let's
expand the whole world and in fact the
space sure you want total security you
don't have to rule everything and what
you're going to do by ruling everything
is create insecurity like for example
increasing the threat of terror and of
nuclear proliferation what do you say to
the kind of criticism you get which has
been strong through the years that you
essentially take to anti-american align
and that you're much too harsh
especially for a Jewish American on
Israel well first of all the idea that I
take an anti-american line is a very
intriguing one it's a standard concept
in totalitarian states if you identify
state power with the culture of the
society the population and so on if you
make that identification strict
totalitarian doctrine then a person who
criticizes state policy is anti-american
and the Soviet Union needs to call an
anti Soviet so the dissidents were anti
Soviet they weren't against Russia
against Russian culture or Russian
people but they were against state
policy so it's a striking totalitarian
concept it's an interesting fact about
the United States that it's used freely
here but almost in no democratic society
I mean take say Italy if somebody
criticizes Berlusconi's policies then
nobody will call them anti-italian so
its hegemony really that brings that
it's a criticism policy yeah and the
if you want to know the history ever
Israeli knows because they know the
Bible of the origins of the concept
anti-israel it goes back to the Bible it
goes back to King Ahab who is the
epitome of evil in the Bible and he
condemned the prophet Elijah for being
way called in Hebrew a hater of Israel
was a hater of the Jews no he was a he
condemned the acts of the evil king that
made him a hater of Israel well you know
that's the origins of this concept this
totalitarian concept let me ask you to
hold that thought because we're coming
up on a break and I want to invite our
listeners to join us in fact you're
cordially invited to participate in this
live program our guest Noam Chomsky your
calls are welcome toll-free eight six
six seven three three six seven eight
six whether you're listening to us on
radio internet or Sirius satellite join
us at that number its toll-free
[Music]
[Music]
this is forum I'm Michael crash near
attack enos hour with Noam Chomsky whose
new book is called failed States the
abuse of power and the assault on
democracy he's with us from Wellesley
Massachusetts and we're gonna go to your
calls here forthwith I just want to
follow through on something brought up
before we went to the break I guess
professor Chomsky that criticism has
been not only perhaps too harsh on
Israel which I think you just answered
quite well but that you have perhaps
also maybe not been critical enough in
fact I've seen this in print a couple of
times the treatment of the Palestinians
by the Arab states I've been quite
critical about that but yes it's true I
don't concentrate on that the very
simple reason for it you and I happen to
share responsibility for what the US and
Israel are doing to the Palestinians we
have only the most indirect
responsibility for what the Arab states
are doing the Arab states hate them I
pointed that out over and over and have
undermined them at every point but and
but we have responsibility for what we
do and what we can influence and when we
could indirectly influence the Arab
states so our closest ally and oldest
ally and most valued ally in the Middle
East is Saudi Arabia where the oil is
the most extreme fundamentalist
government in the world makes Iran look
like a flourishing democracy so yes we
have a certain amount of influence on
Saudi Arabia and we could for example we
could influence Saudi Arabia so for
example mistake a current event a case
the Arab League in the invasion of
Lebanon the Arab League in defiance of
public opinion of us pointed out the
Arab League leaders tyrants who run the
states took a mildly pro-israeli stance
and a stance that's harmful to the
Palestinians well we could have
influenced them to do the opposite
except that that's what the US
government wanted in fact they had to
back down under pressure from their own
populations as for Lebanon you know my
where I was last May you know I think
that as I spoke there it's a don't talk
about it here they should be offered
decent lives in existence in in
Lebanon's that have been confined in
miserable refugee camps okay that's a
serious problem for Lebanese to deal
with but make much sense for me to
criticizes I mean I do when I'm there
but not here you here rarely the
overwhelming issue both in scale and
because it's our responsibility and we
can do something about it is us Israeli
policy so surely other concentrate on
that we understand that principle very
well with regard to official enemies so
let's take say Soviet dissidents I mean
do we care what they said about the
United States or you know the Congo or
anyone else we cared about what they
said about the Soviet Union or take
irani and dissidents today do we care
whether they condemn the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon no we care what
they're saying about Iran and that same
principle applies to us even more so
because we have privilege and a very
free society so we can do lots of things
that they can't do again we're talking
about Noam Chomsky oh try to get as many
of you on here with us as we can we
begin can with you good morning welcome
hi all right thank you for taking my
call i I really know I'm down skiing
you're one of my these heroes I I rent
all your DVDs and I watch them carefully
and they just make me feel I'm sold well
informed and in the world and I just
have a question for you about Iraq in
the beginning of the war I have the
theory that the sanctions were about to
come off Iraq and Iraq had already had
these signed contracts with France
Germany China etc to sell their oil to
those countries and the American oil
companies and George Bush couldn't let
that happen
so they invaded they annulled those
contracts and signed a contract is only
American companies and I and I I feel
like that was their justification for
the war no I was just wondering what you
thought about that
then I can hang up
thank you for the call thank first
thanks for the kind comment we don't
nobody knows the answer to that question
we don't have information about the
internal discussions and debates going
on within the executive branch and
there's a more general point that we
should bear in mind why are all these
things kept secret why is there a
classified records well if you run
through the declassified record in the
United States or anywhere else that I
know about you discover that the issues
are not security except security of the
government from its own population they
essentially want to keep the population
and ignorant of what they're doing and
usually for good reasons those we
mentioned earlier the public is usually
opposed so we don't know what their
internal thinking was what you described
may very well have been a factor my
judgment and it's just an assessment
yours as good as mine but my assessment
is it was not a major factor the major
factor I think was to ensure that the US
government maintains control over the
vast energy resources of the Middle East
I stress control not access policies
would be the same if we were on solar
energy in fact they were the same when
the US didn't use a drop of Middle East
oil
the point is control for reasons that
were clearly expressed 60 years ago
namely that this is what the State
Department called the stupendous source
of strategic power the most
strategically important area in the
world if you control the energy
resources you have a lever of control
over the whole world
so that's extremely important the u.s.
had to withdraw its forces military
forces from Saudi Arabia and again
recognized this which talked about it
because it was just stirring up the
enormous popular anger infects one of
the main sources of al Qaeda so they
wanted to throw them from Saudi Arabia
that place them somewhere else they do
have many
but there couldn't be a better place in
Iraq everyone think Iraq has the FAR's
is known the second-largest energy
resources in the world also they're very
cheap and accessible you know if it dig
through tar sands and stuff and it's
right at the heart of the energy
producing region if they could install a
client state in Iraq which would do
their bidding kind of like you know saw
the doors what Amala and so on they
could install a client state and places
their military bases there oh they would
be an extremely important powerful
position to use we can add Brzezinski is
one of the more astute of the small
planning circles I happen to be critical
of the war but he pointed out that if
the u.s. succeeds in Iraq it will have
what he called critical leverage over
its industrial rivals Asian and European
critical leverage comes from having your
hand on the spigot that's been a guiding
policy for 60 years so my guess is
that's the main that was the main
driving force
you mentioned the troops in Saudi Arabia
and in your book you talk about troops
in Muslim lands pretty much being at the
top of Ben Laden's concerns or caveats
to the West particularly Saudi Arabia
because that's the most holy land right
Medina and Mecca there and but you also
mentioned predatory capitalism and and I
found myself wondering is it your sense
that if we would take troops out of all
Muslim lands and perhaps be less
predatory in her and can't the we being
the United States that there would still
not be the desire by bin Laden and his
minions to establish some kind of
Caliphate over the world does we have
been reading about well they don't
actually call for a Caliphate over the
world I mean that's crazy enough but not
that what they call for is for a
Caliphate over Muslim lands they have
never indicated any desire to establish
a Caliphate in Western Europe which
would be ludicrous in fact you can see
what happened in Russia and Afghanistan
and as long as the Russians were
invading Afghanistan
as Russian troops were there they were
organized by the US in fact they were
the jihadists were fighting the Russians
fact they even carried out terrorism
within Russia during those years as soon
as Russia withdrew that was the end of a
jihadi terrorism against Russia from
Afghanistan and no more I did continue
but from Chechnya which had also
unoccupied Muslim land and they've been
pretty consistent about this they
suspect that Michael Shore
might have said this if you ask him I
think that people who follow their Qaida
closely understand and agree that their
actions are pretty much consistent with
their words he did say that but he also
seemed to feel that there was enough
enmity against the West that they went
against what we could call the
judeo-christian world that he they would
like to see they would like to watch I'm
sorry they would like to see essentially
an annihilation of as they saw in 9/11
of many of those who are not of their
faith or their belief yeah well not the
line 11 case is interesting first of all
the background of it has again he's
written and others have written like it
is the the what what turned us on bin
Laden against the United States was in
1990 he wanted to lead a jihad against
Iraq when it invaded Kuwait and the
Saudi military backed by the United
States refused then they invited
American troops which to him or any you
know religious ultra religious and
Muslim is a other indignity and total
violation of Quranic principles and so
on inviting infidel troops to the
holiest country well at that point he
turned against the United States the
first attack on the World Trade Centers
number was 1993 shortly after that
probably not Osama bin Laden but the
Egyptian based jihadi and so it
continues from their point of view as
sharor is written it's a defensive war
you can hate it or like it that they
perceive themselves as fighting a
defensive war of the invasion of Muslim
lands now it's also worth bearing in
mind that the jihadi groups and
organizations even most militant of them
were quite angry about 9/11 and bitterly
opposed to it there's very good studies
of this by foe as garriga's who's the
main American scholar on these topics
and has studied their hottie Tottie's
very closely he reviews the facts and
sites you know angry fatwas by leading
radical clerics denouncing Osama bin
Laden for carrying out the 9/11 attack
which they were opposed to they regarded
as adventurist and the immoral and the
violation of Islamic principles and so
on well ok at that point which decided
to win there's you know his handlers
decided to invade Afghanistan okay
here's the US again attacking a Muslim
land so that changed all that the same
clerics who had Muslim land that was
essentially giving sanctuary of course
to us ever been like well it was and
there might very well have been a
diplomatic solution for that
recall that the the war was not
undertaken to overthrow the Taliban that
was not a warring that came three weeks
later after the bombing the war was
undertaken with the official aim demand
that the Taliban handover of a film bin
Laden and you know his colleagues
well the Taliban took a ambiguous
attitude toward that they asked for
evidence and notice that bush didn't
call for extradition
that would require evidence they just
said hand over the Taliban said we'll
give us an evidence and they made
various other proposals which may have
been serious or may not we don't know
because the Bush administration rejected
them insisted that he hand them over
even though they had no evidence in fact
they conceded that they had no evidence
eight months later the
head of the FBI Robert Miller get along
interview and the Washington Post is
first discussion of this in which he
said eight months later we suspect that
the 9/11 plot was hatched in Afghanistan
but implemented in Germany and the
United Arab Emirates well that's what
they suspected eight months later they
didn't know it in October
so they couldn't hand over evidence
within habit could that have been
pursued well again we don't know because
it wasn't tried they insisted on bombing
bombing the Talib the Afghans until they
follow us orders fact that became
explicit by the end of the month by the
end of October the they announced that
we announced the Afghan people will
continue to bomb you unless you throw
out the Taliban government well you know
that's pure terrorism and of course
Muslims all over the world bitterly
opposed it as did many others
incidentally the idea that there was
worthwhile widespread support for this
is just a myth you can read the Gallup
polls and late September when they were
talking about the bombing that was
overwhelming opposition to it throughout
the world particularly in Latin America
where they like in Mexico I think
there's two percent support these are
the countries that have had some
experience with but not in the United
States the United States was different
and England was somewhat different but
the only two countries in an
international Gallup poll that gave
support to the impending bombing the
only two were India F of the US and
Britain the only two were India and Nina
and Israel but India and Israel had no
interest whatsoever in Afghanistan India
was thinking about Kashmir and Israel
was thinking about the Palestinians got
more callers in here and Nick Iran good
morning good morning thanks for the show
and dr. Chomsky thank you for being a
continuous voice of reason and insanity
and at the time it's really neither in
my opinion I I think it'd be interesting
to note as well let's not forget wasn't
there a Taliban delegation that came to
Texas in the mid 90s did Nick
a pipeline with Unocal so there was some
friendship there on point but my real
question was in what I perceive as well
as an age of sort of neo totalitarianism
in this country and blanket ignorance
with good percentage of the population
my main issue has been the elections I
believe we've had two coup d'etat and
the statistics bear that out for any
rational free thinking person if I could
I just say dr. Stephen Freeman from the
University Pennsylvania has written
great analyses statistical analyses raw
election data etc I'm wondering if my
premise is correct that the elections
essentially are so rigged with all these
electronic voting machines etc knave
actually been stolen twice in terms of
presidential not to mention others how
does a population can't that's basically
some of the most part ignorant of what's
going on counter this massive fraudulent
hijacking of our electoral system you
can't throw them out of office what do
you do thanks very much thank you for
the call Noam Chomsky I don't disagree I
think he can certainly make a case that
the elections were run by fraud but if
you want my personal opinion that's a
minor issue I mean the elections are the
rut the electoral vote both in 2000 and
2004 was pretty close to 5050 I mean
maybe there's some chicanery and
juggling and so on but it was it was
kind of like tossing a coin the real
issue the fundamental issue about the
elections in my opinion is that they
didn't take place in the first place you
don't have elections when the two
political parties are unwilling to allow
issues to be discussed by the population
and when the elections are run openly by
the public relations industry which
sells candidates the same way they sell
to the based on television now when you
look at a television ad say a car ad you
don't expect to learn anything from it I
mean if we had a market system anything
like it General Motors would put up a
notice saying here the car
models we want to sell next year here
their characteristics they don't do that
though they put up you know a football
player an actress or the car carrying
out some miraculous action or something
and they try to delude you with imagery
not tell you about the not give you
information I mean we all know this we
know that it's all delusion and imagery
well when they sell candidates they do
the same thing so they create imagery of
Bush and imagery of Kerry they keep away
from the issues of the people for the
population doesn't know the stands of
the candidates on issues and we look at
the you see the debates is useless
futile debates are almost useless
they're just first of all the highly
programmed of the and the candidate and
the candidates will not discuss the
issues I mean just to take one example
take the last debate over twenty eight I
think it was it was on this focus on
domestic issues well for the American
population the most significant domestic
issue or very high or highest for a long
time has been the collapsing health care
system and it's the worst in the
industrial world by a longshot
and people suffer from it and for for a
long time
a midget large majority the population
has wanted some kind of national health
care system that's been shown and poll
after poll okay here we come to a debate
on domestic issues and actually the New
York Times the next day accurately
described what happened it praised it
but described it accurately it said that
Kerry refused to mention any kind of
government role in health care because
it has so little political support the
only support it has is an overwhelming
majority of the population but from the
standpoint of the political managers and
the liberal press like the New York
Times
that's not political support political
support main support from the
pharmaceutical corporations and the
insurance in the financial institutions
and so
not true they don't support it so
therefore has no political support and
carried and mentioned well what about
the population there is not part of the
system I mean and that generalizes in
case after case after case it's because
a lobbying is really known of elections
I mean it's it's because the pressure
girls are lobbying money it's because of
pressure groups and lobbying and they're
not only representing what goes on in
government but also donating large
amounts to the campaigns I mean there's
a very narrow concentration of economic
power in the country we all know that
and that overwhelmingly dominates the
electoral system in fact what takes a
the upcoming elections 2006 the whole
House of Representatives is coming up
for election well you go back to the
founding fathers a Madison the
conception was the House of
Representatives would be the Democratic
part of the government people would
actually their opinions would actually
be represented there but the Senate
which as Madison put it involved is
restricted to the wealth of the nation
the most responsible group of men those
who have sympathy with property and so
on the Senate would be the dominant
force and the population would be kind
of removed from mostly from picking
senators or bethey the house is supposed
to be the Democratic force take a look
at the next election that's coming up
count the number of House seats that are
even contested I don't remember the
exact percentage was a small percentage
count the number of incumbents who are
defeated I mean it has become the least
democratic a component of government
because it's all bought it's also
certainly attributable is it not to
gerrymandering and to gerrymander the
power of incumbency I mean it's our
whole system you know I mean
gerrymandering is a striking case and in
the last election 2004 so the reason the
Republicans did not decline in
House membership was because of the
radical gerrymandering in Texas which
should set up a situation in which
Democrats can win let me get you on here
Chuck good morning welcome to forum good
morning thanks very much
you mentioned the military
militarization of space I'd be
interested if you had any specific
information about weapons systems or the
role of NASA and that and what do you
think we should do in Iraq if we would
draw all the populations caught in the
middle of a civil war if we trained up
in Iraqi military in the absence of a
democratic government it seems like it's
just going to be our proxies fighting
other proxies or we could establish a
real democratic government and give them
a peaceful way to resolve their
differences but that's kind of what we
say we're trying to do now so I'd be
real interested to hear what you have to
say Thank You Chuck I'm John Doe a
traditional space in Stein's brief I
would just suggest that you take a look
at the sources that are cited in the
book of mine that just came out which
basically said everything I know about
it you know runs through the specialist
literature and about what I can say on
Iraq the United States definitely does
not want the democratic government in
Iraq I mean that's almost certain the
the idea of Grint if just think for a
minute what the I mean I'm it's amazing
that this isn't discussed is an enormous
discussion about withdrawal you know
exit strategies and so on but they
almost never mention the crucial issue
the crucial issue is that a sovereign
Iraq which is moderately democratic
would be a nightmare for us planners I
mean a sovereign democratic Iraq would
have aid would be it would have a Shiite
majority it was mildly democratic they'd
be the major force the Iraqi Shiites
have pretty close relations to Iran the
one of the main militias in the South
auto brigade was trained in Iran the
clerics were very influential had very
close relations with Iran the Ayatollah
Sistani the major one was born in Iran
they still have a in citizenship this
has come up on this show excuse me and
some experts have said yes but they have
a distinct Iraqi identity and they don't
necessarily follow marching orders from
Teheran I agree with that they you know
they don't necessarily love it ran but
they would much rather have friendly
relations with their powerful neighbors
and Hospital relations but aren't you
also saying that you would think that a
sovereign democratic state in Iraq would
mean essentially the United States would
not have a client state that's your
argument is well the US would
desperately eager to make it a client
state but suppose they can't suppose it
becomes sovereign and democratic mildly
Democratic then it will it's already
doing it but it will increase its
linkages to Iran furthermore there's
another problem right across the border
in Saudi Arabia
there's majority Shiite population
they've been very harshly oppressed by
the ruling tyranny that the u.s.
supports and as there are some moves
towards sovereignty and independence in
CIT RAC there they too are calling for
rights maybe for a degree of autonomy
and so on that happens to be where so
where you DOL is concentrated so the I'm
sure Washington planners are
contemplating which could be an ultimate
nightmare a shiite alliance loose shiite
alliance southern Iraq Iran Saudi
Arabians Shiite areas independent of the
United States controlling most of the
world's oil and I would be devastating
for us plans going back 60 years with
the British almost a hundred years the
furthermore can get worse of the u.s.
can intimidate Europe u.s. shakes its
fist and says withdraw investments for
Iran a big yulian companies do it the
u.s. cannot intimidate China so one of
the reasons are so afraid of China it's
not that some military force it just
isn't intimidated and they're increasing
investment trade not only with Iran but
even with Saudi Arabia they
you know you know the jewel in the crown
for the United States that could
continue if there's be accelerated even
if there's an independent sovereign
mildly democratic Iraq now these are all
things that the u.s. is going to try to
stop by any means it can't whether it
can stop them well that's another
question but that must be a high
priority that's why the US has been so
strongly opposed to democracy in Iraq
sure they talked about it but everyone
talks about democracy everywhere and a
constitution well the u.s. tried to
write the Constitution and when the
Iraqis refused us at the back off the
u.s. tried to eliminate elections with
caucuses and all sorts of other devices
and the invading army was forced to back
off not by insurgents they can deal with
that
they were forced to back off by massive
nonviolent resistance huge demonstrator
there's one of the real triumph of
nonviolent resistance
I regret that we've come to the end of
the hour but as always it's good to have
you on good to talk with you and thank
you so much for being with us Noam
