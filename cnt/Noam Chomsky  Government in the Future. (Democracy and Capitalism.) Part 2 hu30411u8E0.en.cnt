rousseau denounced the sophistication
and intellectuals who search for ways to
obscure the fact so he maintained that
the essential and defining property of
math is freedom they attribute to man
and natural inclination to servitude
without thinking that it is the same for
freedom as for innocence and virtue
their value is felt only as long as one
enjoys than oneself and a taste for them
is lost as soon as one has lost them as
proof of this doctrine he refers to the
marvels done by all free peoples to
guard themselves from oppression true he
says those who have abandoned the life
of a free man do nothing but boast and
secondly of the peace and repose they
enjoy in their chains but when I see the
other sacrifice pleasures reposed wealth
power and life itself for the
preservation of this soul good which is
so disdained by those who have lost it
when I see multitudes of entirely naked
savages European voluptuousness and in
your hunger fire the sword and death to
preserve only their independence I feel
it does not behoove slaves to reason
about freedom a comment which to which
we can perhaps give a contemporary
interpretation rather similar thoughts
were expressed by forty years later
he cannot he says express the prophecy
book accept the proposition that certain
people are not right for freedom for
example the surface of some landlord if
one accepts this assumption he writes
freedom will never be a team for one
cannot arrive at the maturity for
freedom without having already acquired
it one might be free to learn how to
make use of one's powers freely and
usefully the first attempts will surely
be brutal and will lead to a state of
affairs more painful and dangerous than
the former condition under the dominance
but also the protection of an external
authority however one can it be written
only through one's own experiences and
one must be free to be able to undertake
them to accept the principle that
freedom is worthless for those under
one's control and that one has the right
to refuse it to them forever is an
infringement on the right of God Himself
who has created man to be free this
particular remark is interesting because
of its context as well Conte and this
misc asian was defending the french
revolution during terror
against those who claim that it owed the
masses to be unready for the privilege
of freedom and his remarks to I think
have obvious contemporary relevance no
rational person will approve of violence
and terror and in particular the terror
of the post-revolutionary state which
has fallen into the hands of a grim
autocracy has more than once reached
indescribable levels of savagery at the
same time no person of understanding or
humanity will too quickly condemn the
violence that often occurs when long
subdued masses rise against their
oppressors or take their first steps
towards liberty and social
reconstruction Humboldt just a few years
before Conte had expressed the view very
similar to that he also said that
freedom and variety are the
preconditions for human self-realization
nothing promotes this ripeness for
freedom so much as freedom itself this
truth perhaps may not be acknowledged by
those who have so often used this on
ripeness as an excuse for continuing
repression but it seems to me to follow
unquestionably from the very nature of
man the incapacity for freedom can only
arise from a want of moral and
intellectual power to heighten this
power is the only way to supply the want
but to do so presupposes the freedom
which awakens spontaneous activity and
those who do not comprehend this he says
may justly be suspected of
misunderstanding human nature and
wishing to make men into machines Rosa
Luxemburg fraternal sympathetic critique
of Bolshevik ideology and practice was
given in very similar terms only the
active participation of the masses and
self-government and social
reconstruction could bring about what
she described as the complete spiritual
transformation in the masses degraded by
centuries of bourgeois class rule just
as only their creative experience and
spontaneous action can solve the myriad
problems of creating a libertarian
socialist society one might she's
chewing on say that historically the
errors committed by a truly
revolutionary movement are infinitely
more fruitful than the infallibility of
the cleverest Central Committee and I
think that these remarks can be
translated immediately for the somewhat
parallel ideology of the soulful
corporation which is now fairly
popular among American academics for
example Carl Kaizen who writes no longer
the agent of proprietorship seeking to
maximize return on investment management
sees itself is responsible to
stockholders employees customers the
general public and perhaps most
important the firm itself as an
institution there is no display of greed
or grasping this there's no attempt to
push off on the workers of the community
at least part of the social costs of the
enterprise the modern corporation is a
soulful corporation similarly the
Vanguard party is a soulful party and
both cases those who urge that men
submit to the rule of these benevolent
autocracies may I think justly be
accused of wishing to make men into
machines now the correctness of the view
which is expressed by Rousseau and
content Humboldt and Luxembourg and
innumerable others I don't think that
the correctness of this is the moment
susceptible to scientific proof one can
only evaluate it in terms of experience
and intuition but one can also point out
the social consequences of adopting the
view that men are born to be free or
that they are born to be ruled by
benevolent autocrats one of the second
question the question of efficiency is
democratic control of the industrial
system down to its smallest functional
units incompatible with efficiency this
is very frequently argued on several
grounds some say for example that
centralized management is a
technological imperative but I think the
argument is exceedingly week when one
looks into it the very same technology
that brings relevant information to the
board of managers can bring it at the
time that it is needed to everyone in
the workforce the technology that's now
capable of eliminating the stupefying
labor that turns men into specialized
tools of production this technology
permits in principle leisure and the
educational opportunities that make them
able to use this information in a
rational way and furthermore even an
economic elite which is dripping with
soulfulness to use Ralph Miliband's
phrase is constrained by the system in
which it functions to organize
production for certain ends power growth
profit but not in the nature of the case
human needs needs that whenever more
critical degree can be expressed only in
collective terms it's surely conceivable
and perhaps it's even likely that
decisions made by the
elective itself will reflect these needs
and interests as well as those made by
various soulful peeps in any event it's
a bit difficult to take seriously
arguments about efficiency in a society
that devotes such enormous resources to
waste and destruction as everyone knows
the very concept of efficiency is
dripping with ideology Maxima
maximization of commodities is hardly
the only measure of a decent existence
the point is familiar and no elaboration
is necessary well let me turn finally to
the two final points of reference the
 or state socialist in the state
capitalist as I've tried to suggest they
have points in common and an interesting
respects they diverge from the classical
liberal ideal or it's later elaboration
in libertarian socialism since I'm
concerned with our society let me make a
few rather elementary observations about
the role of the state it's likely
evolution and the ideological
assumptions that accompany and sometimes
disguise these phenomenon it's obvious
to begin with but we can distinguish two
systems of power the political system in
the economic system the former consists
in principle of elected representatives
of the people who set public policy the
latter in principle is a system of
private power a system of private
empires that are free from public
control except in the remote and
indirect ways in which even a feudal
nobility or pellet Aryan dictatorship
must be responsive to the public will
there are several immediate consequences
of this organization of society the
first is that in a subtle way an
authoritarian cast of mind is induced in
a very large mass of the population
which is subject to arbitrary decree
from above I think this has a great
effect on the general character of a
culture the effect the belief that one
must obey arbitrary dictates and accede
to Authority and I think in fact a
remarkable and exciting fact about the
youth movement in recent years is that
it's challenging and beginning to break
down some of these authoritarian
patterns second fact that is important
is that the range of decisions that are
in principle subject the public
democratic control is quite narrow for
example it excludes in
oil in principle the central
institutions in any advanced industrial
society that is the entire commercial
industrial and financial system and a
third fact is that even within the
narrow range of issues that are
submitted in principle to democratic
decision-making the Centers of private
power of course exert an inordinately
heavy influence in perfectly obvious
ways through control of the media
through control of political
organizations are fun fact phyllis by
the simple and direct means of supplying
the top personnel for the parliamentary
system itself as they obviously do dick
Barnett in a recent study of this
reports hit study of the top 400
decision-makers in the post-war national
security system but most have I quote
now come from executive suites and law
offices within shouting distance of each
other in 15 city blocks and five major
cities and every other study shows the
same thing in short the democratic
system had best functions within a very
narrow range in a capitalist democracy
and even within this narrow range its
functioning is enormously biased by the
concentrations of private power and by
the authoritarian and passive modes of
thinking that are induced by autocratic
institutions such as industries for
example it's a truism but one that must
be constantly stressed the capitalism
and democracy are ultimately quite
incompatible and a careful look at the
matter i think merely strengthens this
conclusion there are perfectly obvious
processes of centralization of control
taking place in both the political and
the industrial system as far as the
political system is concerned in every
parliamentary democracy not only ours
the role of parliament and policy
formation has been declining in the
years since World War two as everyone
knows and political commentators
repeatedly point out the executive in
other words has become increasingly more
powerful as the planning functions of
the state become more significant the
House Armed Services Committee a couple
of years ago described the role of
Congress as that of a sometimes quare
euless but essentially kindly uncle who
complains while furiously puffing on his
pipe but who finally is everyone expects
gives in and hands over the allowance
and careful studies of civil military
decision since world war two
this is quite an accurate perception
senator Vandenberg 20 years ago
expressed his fear that the American
chief executive would become the number
one world war lord of the earth his
phrase that has since occurred clearest
decision is the decision to escalate in
Vietnam and februari 1965 and cynical
disregard of the expressed will of the
electorate this incident reveals I think
perfect clarity the role of the public
in decisions about peace and war the
role of the public in decisions about
the main lines of public policy in
general and it also suggests the
relevance of electoral politics to major
decisions of national policy
unfortunately you can't vote the rascals
out because you never voted them in in
the first place the corporate the
corporate executives and the corporation
lawyers and so on who overwhelmingly
staff the executive assisted
increasingly by a university-based
Mandarin class these people remain in
power no matter whom you elect and
furthermore it's interesting to note
that this ruling elite is pretty clear
about its social role as an example take
Robert McNamara who's a person widely
praised in liberal circles for his
humanity is technical brilliance and has
campaigned to control the military his
views of social organization I think are
quite illuminating he says vital
decision making in policy matters as
well as business must remain at the top
that is partly they're not completely
what the top is for and he goes on to
suggest that this is apparently a divine
imperative I quote god is clearly
democratic he distributes brain power
universally but he quite justifiably
expects us to do something efficient and
constructive with that priceless gift
that's what management is all about
management management is in the end the
most creative of all the arts for its
medium is human talent itself the real
threat to democracy comes from under
management the under management of
society is not the respect of Liberty it
is simply to let some force other than
reason shape reality if it is not reason
the rule
and then man falls short of his
potential end quote so reason then is to
be identified as the sexualization of
decision making at the top and the hands
of management popular involvement in
decision-making is a threat to Liberty a
violation of reason reason is embodied
in autocratic tightly managed
institutions strengthening these
institutions within which men and
function most efficiently is in his
words the great human adventure of our
time well this has a faintly familiar
ring to it and I think it is the
authentic role of the the authentic
voice of the technical intelligentsia
liberal intelligentsia the technocratic
corporate elite in a modern society
there is a parallel process of
centralization and economic life there's
a recent FTC report which notes that the
200 largest manufacturing corporations
now control about two-thirds of all
manufacturing assets at the beginning of
World War two the same amount of power
was spread over a thousand corporations
I quote the report it says a small
industrial elite of huge conglomerate
companies is gobbling up American
business and largely destroying
competitive free enterprise furthermore
it says the 200 corporations are
partially linked with each other and
with other corporations in ways that may
prevent or discourage independent
behavior and market decisions what is
novel about such observations is only
their source the FTC they are familiar
to the point of cliche among left
liberal commentators on American society
the centralization of power also has an
international dimension it's been
pointed out that on the base on quoting
from fares that on the basis of the
gross value of their output us
enterprises abroad in the aggregate
compressed the third largest country in
the world with a gross product greater
than that of any country except the
United States and Soviet Union American
firms control over half the automobile
industry in England almost 40% of
petroleum in Germany over forty percent
that tell of the telegraphic telephone
and electronic and business equipment in
France seventy-five percent of the
computers within a decade given present
trends more than half of the British
exports will be from American owned
companies
furthermore these are highly
concentrated investments forty percent
of direct investment in Germany France
and Britain is by three firms American
firms George ball has explained that the
project of constructing an integrated
world economy dominated by American
Capital an empire in other words is no
idealistic pipe dream but a hard-headed
prediction it's a role he says into
which we are being pushed by the
imperatives of our own economy the major
instrument being the multinational
corporation which George ball describes
as follows in its modern form the
multinational corporation or one with
worldwide operations and markets is a
distinctly American development through
such corporations it has become possible
for the first time to use the world's
resources with maximum efficiency but
there must be greater unification of the
world economy to give full play to the
benefits of multinational corporations
these multinational corporations are the
beneficiary of the mobilization of
resources by the federal government and
its worldwide operations and markets are
back ultimately of American military
force now based in dozens of countries
it's not difficult to guess who will
reap the benefits from the integrated
world economy which is the domain of
operation of these American based
international economic institutions well
at this stage and discussion one has to
mention the specter of communism what is
the threat of communism to this system
for a clear and cogent answer when can
turn to an extensive study of the
Woodrow Wilson foundation the National
Planning Association called the
political economy of American aren't
policy very important book which was
compiled by a representative segment of
the tiny elite that largely sets public
policy whoever is technically in office
in effect that's as close as you can
come to a manifesto of the American
ruling class here they define the
primary threat of communism as a quote
the economic transformation of the
communist powers in ways which reduce
their willingness or ability to
complement the industrial economies of
the West that is the primary threat of
communism communism in short reduces the
willingness and ability of
underdeveloped countries to function in
the world capitalist economy in the
manner of
uncle the Philippines which has
developed a colonial economy of a
classic pipe after 75 years of American
tutelage and domination it's this
doctrine which explains why the British
economists Joan Robinson describes the
American crusade against communism as a
crusade against development the Cold War
ideology and the International Communist
conspiracy function an important way as
essentially a propaganda device to
mobilize support at a particular
historical moment for this long time
Imperial enterprise in fact I believe
that this is probably the main function
of the Cold War it serves as a useful
device for the managers of American
society and their counterparts in the
Soviet Union to control their own
populations and their own respective
imperial systems I think that the
persistence of the Cold War can be in
part explained by its utility for the
managers of the two great world systems
well there's one final element that has
to be added to this picture namely the
ongoing the authorization of American
society how does this enter in to see I
think want us to look back at World War
two and to recall that prior to World
War two of course we were deep in the
depression World War two taught a an
important economic lesson it taught the
lesson that government induced
production in a carefully controlled
economy centrally controlled could
overcome the effects of a depression I
think this is what Charles E Wilson had
in mind in 1944 when he proposed that we
then that we have a permanent war
economy in the postwar world of course
the trouble is that in a capitalist
economy there only a number of ways in
which government intervention can take
place can't be competitive with the
private empires for example which is to
say if it can't be any useful production
in fact it has to be the production of
luxury goods goods not not capital not
useful commodities which would be
competitive and unfortunately there's
only one category of luxury goods that
can be produced endlessly with rapid
obsolescence quickly Westing and no
limit on how many of them you can use we
all know what that is this whole matter
is described pretty well by the business
historian Alfred Chandler he describes
the economic lessons of World War two as
follows the government spent
are more than the most enthusiastic new
dealer had ever proposed most of the
output of the expenditures was destroyed
or left on the battlefields of Europe
and Asia but the resulting increased
demand sent the nation into a period of
prosperity the like of which had never
before had been seen moreover the
supplying of huge armies and navies
fighting the most massive war of all
time required a centralized control of
the National accompany this effort
brought corporate managers to Washington
to carry out one of the most complex
pieces of economic planning in history
that experience lessened the ideological
fears over the government's role in
stabilizing the economy is the
conservative commentator and point out
maybe added that the ensuing Cold War
carried further the D politicization of
American society and created kind of ins
a psychological environment in which the
government is able to intervene and part
through fiscal policies and part through
public work and public services but very
largely of course through defense
spending in this way to use Alfred
Chandler's words the government acts as
a coordinator of last resort when
managers are unable to maintain a high
level of aggregate demand as another
conservative historian Joseph Monson
rights and lightened corporate managers
far from fearing government intervention
in the economy view the new economics as
a technique for increasing corporate
viability of course the most cynical use
of these ideas is by the managers of the
publicly subsidized for industries there
was a remarkable series in washington
post about this last about a year ago by
bernard no sitter for example he quoted
samuel downer financial vice president
of LTV aerospace one of the big new
conglomerates who explained why the
postwar world must be bolstered by
military orders he said its basic it's
selling appeal is defensive a home this
is one of the greatest appeals the
politicians have to adjusting the system
if you're the president and you need a
control factor in the economy and you
need to sell this factor you can't sell
Harlem and watts but you can sell
self-preservation and new environment
we're going to increase defense budgets
as long as those bastards in Russia are
ahead of us the American people
understand this of course those bastards
aren't exactly ahead of us in this dead
Liam cynical game
but that's only a minor embarrassment to
the thesis in times of need we can
always follow the rescue bird Humphrey
and other luminaries and appeal to the
billion Chinese armed to the teeth and
setting out a world conquest again I
want to emphasize the role in this
system of the Cold War as a technique of
domestic control technique for
developing the psychological climate of
paranoia and psychosis in which the
taxpayer will be willing to provide an
enormous endless subsidy to the
technologically advanced sectors of
American industry and the corporations
that dominate this increasingly
centralized system well of course
perfectly obvious that Russian
imperialism is not an invention of
American ideologists it's real enough to
the Hungarians of a checks for example
what is an invention is the uses to
which it's put for example by Dean
Acheson or nineteen nineteen fifty or
Walt Rostow a decade later when they
pretend that the Vietnam War is an
example of Russian imperialism or by the
Johnson administration in 1965 when it
justifies the Dominican intervention
with reference to the sino-soviet
military blood or by the Kennedy
intellectuals who as Townsend hoops put
it in a article in The Washington
Monthly last month were diluted by the
tensions of the Cold War years and not
perceived that the triumph of the
national revolution in Vietnam would not
be a triumph for Moscow and Peking the
most remarkable degree of delusion on
the part of presumably literate men or
for example by Eugene Rostow who in a
recent book that was very widely praised
by liberal senators and academic
intellectuals outlined the series of
challenges to World Order in the modern
era as follows Napoleon Kaiser Wilhelm
Hitler and continuing in the postwar
world general strikes in france and
italy the civil war in greece and the
attack on south vietnam where he writes
in 1968 russia has put up to severe
tests and its efforts to spread
communism by the sword now there's a
very interesting series of challenges to
World Order Napoleon kaiser Vilhelm
Hitler general strikes in france and
italy the civil war in Greece and the
russian attack on south vietnam
if one thinks it through he can some
pretty interesting conclusions about
modern history well one can continue
this indefinitely I mean to suggest that
the Cold War is highly functional both
to the American elite and its Soviet
counterpart who in a perfectly similar
way exploit Western imperialism which
they did not invent as they send their
armies into Czechoslovakia it's
important in both cases in providing an
ideology for Empire and for the
government subsidized system here of
military capitalism it's predictable
then that challenges to this ideology
will be bitterly resisted by force if
necessary now in many ways American
society is indeed open and liberal
values are preserved however is poor
people and black people and other ethnic
minorities know very well the liberal
veneer is pretty thin Mark Twain once
wrote that it is by the goodness of God
that in our country we have those three
unspeakably precious things freedom of
speech freedom of conscience and the
prudence never to practice either of
them
those who lack the prudence may well pay
the cost roughly speaking I think it's
accurate to say that a corporate a lead
of managers and owners governs the
economy in the political system as well
the political system as well at least in
very large measure the people so-called
do exercise an occasional choice among
those who Marx once called the rival
factions and adventurers of the ruling
class and those who find this
characterization too harsh may prefer
the formulations a modern democratic
theorists like Joseph Schumpeter who
describes modern political democracy
favorably as a system in which the
deciding of issues by the electorate is
secondary to the election of the men who
were to do the deciding a political
party he says accurately is a group
whose members proposed to act in concert
in the competitive struggle for
political power if that were not so it
would be impossible for different
parties who adopt exactly or almost
exactly the same program that's all the
advantages of political democracy as he
sees it this program both parties adopt
more or less exactly and the individuals
who compete for power they express a
narrow conservative ideology basically
the interests of one or other element in
the corporate elite with some
modifications now this is obviously no
conspiracy i think it's simply implicit
in the system of corporate capitalism
these people and the institutions they
represent are in effect in power and
their interests are the national
interest it's this interest that is
served primarily and overwhelmingly by
the overseas Empire and the growing
system of military state capitalism at
home if we were to withdraw the consent
of the governed as I think we should we
are withdrawing our consent to have
these men and the interests they
represent govern and manage American
society and impose their concept of
world order and their criteria for
legitimate political and economic
development in much of the world
although an immense effort of propaganda
mystification is carried on to conceal
these facts nonetheless facts they
remain we have today the technical and
material resources to meet man's animal
needs we have not developed the coach
and moral resources or the democratic
forms of social organization that make
possible the humane and rational use of
our material wealth and power
conceivably the classical liberal ideals
as expressed and developed in their
libertarian socialist form are
achievable but if so only by a popular
revolutionary movement rooted in wat
strata of the population and committed
to the elimination repressive and
authoritarian institutions state and
private to create such a movement is the
challenge we face and must meet if
there's to be an escape from
contemporary barbarism
