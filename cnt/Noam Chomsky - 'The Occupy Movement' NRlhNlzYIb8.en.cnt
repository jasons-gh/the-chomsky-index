ladies and gentlemen welcome to the
great conversation we're privileged to
have with us today one of the most
prominent intellectuals the 20th century
indeed in a ranking of the most
frequently cited academic sources of all
time today's speaker ranked eighth just
behind Sigmund Freud and just ahead of
Hegel and Cicero he was the only living
person to make the list
our guest today has been a professor of
linguistics at MIT for over 50 years and
his contributions to the field of
linguistics cannot be overstated his
recognition of the innate human capacity
for human language has not only
revolutionized the field of linguistics
but proved indispensable the transition
from behavioral psychology to cognitive
theory yet today's speaker is perhaps
best known not for his tremendous
academic work but rather for his
political activism the genesis of his
political activism the Vietnam War is a
familiar tale and yet from the very
beginning his ideas have been anything
but typical weather for taking the media
modern corporatism or American
imperialism he speaks with a soft but
resounding voice he demands that we
turned to the fast when evaluating our
institutions and our policies not mere
rhetoric or intentions since he emerged
as a force in the political discourse
almost 50 years ago today's speaker has
been a singular and consistent voice
standing athwart American foreign policy
shouting style today he'll be talking to
us about Occupy Wall Street there's no
exaggeration to say that today's speaker
is among the intellectual progenitors of
that movement his ideas form the central
feces of the Occupy movement both in his
critique of growing income inequality
and modern capitalism his views have
found new residence among a generation
both Jason and emboldened by the Great
Recession on the political spectrum
today's speaker falls to the left but he
defies political classification
frustrating partisans of
major parties in equal measure but no
matter our political stripes he
challenges each of us to think
critically and carefully about the
institutions and ideas which shape our
lives and to continue in earnest the
great conversation please join me in
welcoming to rhodes college professor
Noam Chomsky
start by apologizing for keeping you
waiting for too long and it's one of
those days when everything that could go
wrong did go wrong starting at seven
o'clock in the morning I won't take you
through the Trail of Tears but I am
impressed with your patience and
perseverance however I can't give you
the prize for that when you travel
around a lot in the winter as I do talks
all over the place things go wrong
constantly and the prize at least in my
experience is the labor movement in
British Columbia where I was supposed to
give a couple years ago keynote address
at their annual labour conference
supposed to be about seven o'clock and
everything went wrong I got there around
midnight they were quite cheerful and
happy we went on most of the night
because there wasn't much point going to
sleep
I won't keep to that long tonight here
okay so let's get to the Occupy
movements the I think they will prove as
was said to be of historic importance
the certainly unprecedented both in
their scale and their character their of
course have been plenty of popular
movements over the years but none quite
like this and that makes sense the times
are unprecedented this is the first
major popular response to a radical
change in American history actually look
at the trajectory of American history
since the beginning it's been on a
pretty steady course of growth
development industrialization expansion
of Rights expansion of democracy there
have been ups and downs there's
regression to but and it hasn't been
very pretty in many respects I won't go
into that but the general of course has
been fairly steady over a couple hundred
years and that's changed it changed in
the 1970s quite significantly the during
this whole period during the I mean even
in the darkest times there was almost
always a kind of a sense that of
hopefulness we're going to get out of
this somehow we'll keep going on our
long course um just about old enough to
remember the great depression the first
couple of years were gruesome but by the
mid-1930s things were although that it
was in absolute terms much worse than
today the there was nevertheless a
feeling of kind of optimism about what's
going to come
my family was mostly unemployed working
class I could see they felt but the
there was the revived of the labor
movement had been totally crushed in the
1920s mainly by woodrow wilson's red
scared but it was beginning to revive
see ILO was organizing they were
sit-down strikes which are very
threatening to private power or sit-down
strike is one step before the
realization that we can take this place
over and run it ourselves we don't need
the bosses and that's frightening and
other the those and other pressures were
leading a sympathetic administration to
introduce quite significant reforms and
you could feel that you could feel at
the people's lives that the oppression
did man it didn't end until the Second
World War but which was a huge
government stimulus which did get the
country out of depression just as a much
smaller stimulus could get us out of
this much smaller recession but right
throughout the late 30s there was a
feeling a definite feeling that's going
to be over we can work together we can
get out of this it's going to be better
than now that's not true now throughout
the country there's a feeling of anger
or frustration hopelessness despair
hatred of everything hatred of
institutions you see it in polls and you
can see it is just go around there's a
there's a recognition of something which
unfortunately is true a policy is
designed to ensure that it's not going
to get better manufacturing
in the manufacturing industries the real
unemployment today is pretty much like
it was during the depths of the
depression but then there was an
understanding well it's going to come
back and now on the present course is
not going to come back not on the
president corazon please and I stress
again by design there are alternatives
there always have been the roads are
pretty and that's true today in our
particular concern always today as well
as other times always ought to be with
the most deprived African Americans
whose fate should be particularly on our
minds these few days the commemorating
the birth of art Luther King well I'm
not going to run through the basic facts
I think you're probably all familiar
with them they've been very effectively
brought to national attention by the
Occupy movement fact that's one of the
great successes you may have seen that
just a couple of days ago there was a
poll released as poll done annually by
the Pew foundation asking people what
they think is the greatest source of
tension and conflict in American life
and for the first time ever the what was
way the top was concerned over income
inequality that increased by fifty
percent since 2009 it's not that the
income inequality has increased but the
recognition and comprehension and
understanding of its significance have
and that's a tribute to the Occupy
movement which put this critical fact of
modern life on our particular strikingly
in our society put it on the agenda so
people who may have sort of known and in
their own personal experience see that
I'm not alone this is all of us and in
fact the u.s. is just off the spectrum
on this I mean it's like
world country the inequality is risen to
again historically unprecedented Heights
the imagery of the Occupy movement which
has taken over of the one percent uh 99
percent there's more or less accurate
but if you really want to be precise
about it the massive inequality is very
largely weighted by a tiny fraction of
one percent actually about one-tenth of
one percent a group so small that
they're not even picked up by the census
have too complicated sophistical
analysis to dig them up that's hedge
fund managers CEOs of financial
corporations their incomes of just off
into the stratosphere and that weights
the distribution very strikingly I'm as
bad and the rest of it's bad enough to
but that's a major fact the for the
general population it's been a
generation of essentially stagnation
there is of course economic growth not
as much as during the great growth
periods of the 50s and 60s but there's
some and and it's going into very few
pockets the real wages for the majority
have pretty much sag nated that's prior
to the collapse in which everything
crashed so have people have gotten by
sort of but they've gotten by by chaka
sharply increasing work hours there now
far beyond Europe which is a scandal in
itself that is the richest most
privileged country
the world is going in comparable
advantages but work hours are far higher
than Europe or other industrial
countries people of going deeply into
debt of course unsustainable and they've
capitalized on the regular bubbles that
have begun ever since the early Reagan
years as deregulation said there were no
price financial crises in the fifties
and sixties the New Deal regulations
were in place but starting not late
seven days particularly in the Reagan
years there's a kind of a fanatic
pressure for deregulation and it
predictably led to repeated crises the
jury bad bubbles you know blow up and
people think they're wealthy but Bennett
it collapses and you see this old paper
foil the latest one I could get worse
each time the latest one was the housing
bubble which and when that crashed there
were literally eight trillion dollars of
fake wealth disappeared that's why
people can consume and most people's
assets were in their houses which were
fake if you haven't read it yet you
should read the New York Times this
morning the yesterday the Federal
Reserve released as it does over here
the reef it releases the records from
discussions five years earlier so you
can find out what the Fed was talking
about five
years ago they released them for 2006
that is pretty incredible look at advise
you to do it these are highly trained
economists and bankers they could see
that the that houses were that house
prices were going way out of sight and
no relation whatsoever to any economic
fundamentals and off a track that had
been gone on for a hundred years I'm
prevent a hundred years house prices
pretty much track gross domestic product
size of the economy as you'd expect
about ten years ago they started
shooting off into the distance no basis
for it but they said it's fine nothing's
happening and the reason why nothing is
happening is because there is a religion
we can laugh about you know extremist
religious groups but these are some of
the most educated smartest people in the
world trapped in religious beliefs the
religions it had been pointed out joseph
stiglitz of ilori at about 17 or 18
years ago warned the profession that
they should not be seduced by what he
called the religion that markets know
best they don't you know and you look at
history to see reliance on markets
ask her over and over but the religion
took over nobody questioned that Alan
Greenberg the Greenspan was Saint Allen
West economist of all time but just read
the discussions from five years ago she
puts a few months before the whole thing
crashed they tell you a lot about our
intellectual culture and sobering and
revealing this is that's how people been
getting by that none of this happens
because of economic loss or it's not the
result of Technology it's no other
standard of asians it's by design just a
couple of weeks ago there's a very good
organization the economic policy
institute it annually puts out the major
the standard kind of databases about
what's going on in the economy a very
good analyses to state of work in
America at school they just came out
with a small monograph reviewing what
they've been describing and analyzing
for the last 25 years it's called
federer by design and it's exactly the
right title it's a failure for some I'll
come back to that but it's all by design
it was planned there are choices all the
way along and the choices that have been
made have led to these outcomes I which
should be encouraging because it tells
us that other choices can be made it's
not something that just kind of happens
well what happened in in the 1970s there
was a quite a sharp shift in the nature
of the economy not the moment but took
place by the 80s it was in place went on
there there was a shift from 22 major
shifts one towards financialization
devoting more and more of the economy to
financial manipulation rather than
making things that people made
production continued but it was offshore
so there's offshoring and financial
manipulations here there were number of
reasons for that the one reason was
simply that there was through the
earlier period of steady decline in the
rate of profit in manufacturing so that
people who were trying to make money
have capital to invest look for we can
make money and this is his decline in
the rate of profit manufacturing here
you go to where you make more profit
like by you know assembly Apple
computers and Foxconn and China
Taiwanese own factory China utterly
hideous conditions as suicides strikes
and so on but you make a lot of money
that way and also just by financial
manipulation and that was expedited by
the fact by something else that happened
the there had been international
economic system the Bretton Woods system
which was established by Britain in the
United States the two victors of the
Second World War that right after the
Second World War and it sort of on the
British side of his John Maynard Keynes
and the American side Harry Dexter boy
rural economies and they kind of planned
out a system
designed to encourage growth and
equitable growth and in fact that worked
in the 50s in the 60s is the highest
birth period in modern economic history
over a long stretch and it was equitable
so the lowest quintile did about as well
as the highest quinta that sometimes
called the Golden Age of capitalism that
was based on the Britain would system
which had a number of principles to it
one of them was control over capital so
controls capital controls can't just
export capital and regulated currencies
you can't speculate against currencies
so that cut down financial you know
chicanery and drove investment towards
productive investment well that broke
down in the early 70s for various
regions reasons that change decomp those
things change the economy enormously so
you go back to the 50s and 60s the banks
were thanks they were doing what you're
supposed to do in a kind of state
capitalist economy like ours they take
unused capital like say your bank
account and lend it to somebody who's
trying to do something productive with
it like start business or buy a house
it's the college or whatever it might be
that's what and there were small part of
the economy but now they're they're not
banks anymore there you know casinos
incredible amounts of money but it all
bursts because it's fake and when it
bursts the taxpayer has a task family
bail bail him out that's how did
repeatedly since the early 80s by 2007
read it right before the latest crash
and the worst crash i should say the
worst crash so far because we're now
building the next one which will
probably be in the works since
everything's still in place but they had
about forty percent of corporate profits
this is for under probably harming the
economy in fact the few general analysis
is one came after the Bank of England
recently as the try to estimate their
impact on the economy and it's a pretty
steady DD to downward pressure on the
gross domestic product so and that's you
know forty percent of corporate profit
well of course that is consequences it
sets in motion a kind of a vicious cycle
when wealth is a wealth is always of
course been concentrated but nothing
like the way there are a few cases in
the past which also were monstrosities
but this
the only one since the 1920s of the only
one you concentrate wealth that
automatically yields concentrate on a
political power concentrated will and
use many devices to influence you
control what the government does says
concentration of political power
concentration of political power
Renfield's legislation and the
legislation is designed to increase the
concentration of wealth so you get a
vicious cycle you get a fiscal policy
like sharp cutting back of taxes for the
very wealthy extreme was the bush tax
cuts but it's been going on since the
80s late 70s actually so fiscal policies
their rules of corporate governance
which give more and more power to
corporate executives marginalized
shareholders and others there a
deregulation which drives the process
forward and variety of those devices at
their other theme there was a new trick
international trade regime instituted in
the eighties in the 90s like NAFTA for
example North American so-called Free
Trade Agreement very bad name the
agreement it wasn't it's not free trade
and it certainly wasn't an agreement at
least if people are part of their
countries because it was opposed by the
people in all three countries involved
kind of a
Mexico but it's called the North
American Free Trade Agreement it was
North America basic very basic component
in fact that's true of all the world
trade organization structures is to set
working people in competition with one
another well he said working people in
competition with one another that drives
down wages capital is mobile after the
especially after the breakdown of the
Bretton Woods system so capitals mobile
Labor's in mobile you have you know
bitter vicious immigration constraint
principles to prevent labor from being
mobile so the automatic what that's
gonna lead to it it means that capital
will gain labor will lose and that was
it should mention that the supposed hero
of the people who call themselves free
market adherence is Adam Smith if you
look back at Adam Smith he observed
quite plausibly that the foundation of
free markets is free circulation of
Labor if Labour can't move freely you
can't talk about free markets the but
that's blocked its capital it's free not
labor well there were other things at it
as well at the same policy so for
example Reagan significantly changed
labor relations there had been major
attacks on unions for years but Raven
escalated it sharply he broke with thee
with many years of standard practice in
the
30 countries and made it possible for to
rely on scabs to break unions by the
time that first was the air-controllers
then it spread by the time it hit the
manufacturing sector doors caterpillar
was the first one a couple of years I've
broken a UAW strike by bringing strike
breakers at that point the I think the
US was the only industrial country in
the world that allowed it outside of
South Africa it was just unheard and
this increased when NAFTA came along
that it becomes clinton NAFTA offered
opportunities for employers to use
illegal methods to break strikes the
illegal method offered by NAFTA was to
make it possible for strike breaking by
employers to threaten to move the
enterprise to Mexico unless you back off
that's illegal but when you have a
criminal stage at doesn't matter nothing
you do virtually sold the business world
that they weren't but of course the
labor laws and the number of firing of
workers for illegal firing of workers
for organizing a shuttle way up and
while there were many other good studies
in this alongside of this came a
government insurance policy for
financial firms financial firms
increasingly were driving the mostly
fake wealth production but it but they
continually crash the so they
insurance policy and it kind of has a
name that's called too big to fail so
thanks if two banks are too big to fail
you're going to bail them out when they
crash well that's an incentive to say
you're if you're a bang to work in an
investment bank it's Goldman Sachs or
whatever it's an incentive to make risky
transactions which give high profit us
their risky and not to care too much if
it crashes the system so called systemic
risk because when it does is going to do
since its underpricing risk the taxpayer
will come and build out it's called too
big to fail that's Obama's first major
policy picking up from bush but it's
happened over and over since the early
80s well it's another measuring and so
it continues in fact what we're living
with now here it is a kind of a
nightmare that was understood by the
classical economist so if you read Adam
Smith and David Ricardo sort of founders
of modern economics they understood that
this could happen so Adam Smith for
example is interested in England of
course he asked the question what would
happen if in England the merchants and
the manufacturers do the ones who
improve the economy then if the
merchants and manufacturers decided to
invest outside of England and to import
from outside of England and what we call
neoliberal globalization suppose they
decided to do that he said well then
they would profit but England would
suffer however he said he didn't think
that was going to happen because they
would
what economists on Pensacola home bias
they preferred to business in their own
country so as if by an invisible hand
England would be saved from the ravages
of neoliberal globalization they didn't
use that phrase that's think it's a
pretty hard it's that usage of the term
invisible hand is kind of hard to miss
it's the one occurrence of the phrase in
his book wealth of nations in an
argument a warning against the nightmare
that we're living in and saying it won't
happen because by an invisible hand will
be saved since the emergence of
manufacturers would prefer to be at home
the David record of his successor great
economist to notice the same thing and
he was even stronger he said you know
this could happen everything will fall
apart but he he hopes that the people
who own and run the economy will care
enough about their own countries so they
won't let this end and divert sorry to
see the sentiment the spirit well the
1970s the first time the sentiment
disappeared and we're in the middle of
that night not a new one you can find it
in the classical texts now there is a
lot that the classical economist didn't
start didn't attend to
pay attention to the one is the growth
of democracy remember we're talking
about late 18th early 19th century and
since that time popular struggles have
one major games in expanding rights
democratic rights civil rights and so on
these two have been under quite severe
attack during the you can only call it a
really dedicated class war of the past
generation there are a lot of devices
but one device is just the skyrocketing
cost of elections that started same
period like plates out of these shut up
in the 80s while that hasn't fed as the
cost of elections go up the parties are
driven into the pockets of those who
have the money but in the corporate
pockets which permits the corporation is
to effectively by hit the election read
it on the front page of the newspaper
every day now are you watching
television you see it this for the
Republicans it was kind of reflexive the
Democrats sewer and now it used to be
coke moderate Republicans
shifting to the right and it goes well
behind this there's a very good scholar
has done the main work on this project
Thomas Ferguson's knee right about four
years tracing the way back but he's
pointed out something else food he
points out that uniquely among
legislators in the developed world US
congressional parties now pose a crisis
for key slots in the lawmaking process
outside investors and interest groups
become decisive in resolving leadership
struggles within the parties giving us
not the best country Congress that money
can buy but the worst that's correct and
the notorious Citizens United decision
of the Supreme Court two years ago
that's escalated it sharply again you
see that on the TV screen in the front
pages right now well that of course
undermines democracy there's a lot more
and there are either deeper factors than
this which aren't so obvious on the
surface but it's a think about it it's
it's clear that high concentration of
wealth and especially in financial
institutions that creates what some
economists have called a virtual Senate
of investors and lenders who carry out a
moment-by-moment referendum on
government policies and as they find
those policies to be irrational meaning
they work for the benefit of people not
profit then they vote against the
policies by crashing the economy by
threatening to
we're capital flight tax on the currency
and so on so government's end up having
what's called a dual constituency their
own population theoretically that's one
constituency and the virtual Senate and
guess who wins surprisingly that's
understood in the technical economics
literature and it's kind of interesting
to see how it's described in the major
scholarly literature on Finance or quote
from the major standard text barry
eichengreen person writes about this he
points out that in the 19th century
societies societies had not yet been
politicized by universal male suffrage
and the rise of trade unionism and
parliamentary Labour Party's so
therefore the severe costs that are
imposed by unregulated markets could be
just transferred to the population
however during the 30s and the court is
with the radicalization of the
population depression the anti-fascist
war that luxury was no longer available
to private power so in the Bretton Woods
system post-war system limits on capital
mobility substituted for limits on
democracy as a source of insulation from
market pressures that's pretty accurate
and then we have to do is add a
corollary when you dismantle the system
from the seventies functioning democracy
is restricted and you got to do some
things but one thing have to do is
somehow divert and control the public
that's pretty dramatic and especially in
the Republican Party the more business
oriented
the two factions of the business very
edges what they would be cool the
Republicans have just abandoned any
pretense of being a traditional
parliamentary party they simply serve
the corporate sector and extreme wealth
and they do it kind of with lockstep
uniformity I'm like the old communist
party everybody has I repeat the same
catechism well you can't win elections
that way so you have to find some new
constituencies and what they did was a
reasonable thing they turn two
tendencies of the population that always
been there but they haven't been
mobilized politically so evangelical
religious sectors that's kind of off the
international spectrum but in the United
States it's quite mainstream and
remember this country's way off the
spectrum and religious extremism and I'm
not even talking about the extremism of
those who think that believe in the
religion that markets know best that's
the worst religion we were talking about
the about two-thirds of the population
is waiting for the second coming and
about half of them expected their own
lifetimes about half think the world is
created a couple thousand years ago and
it's very good
I mean this little wanted a long story
in American history low reasons for it
could this was never active political
force between average becoming that it's
one of the sectors that the remnants of
the Republican Party could mobilize now
that they've abandoned any pretense of
being a political party the other major
sector which has also always been there
is a nativist people who are kind of
trembling with fear and hatred about
somebody's going to come and take
everything away from us and so on and so
forth that's also a strain that goes way
back a lot of ugly repercussions you
know them here in fact but it was not
really mobilized as a major political
force until recently now it is it's
connected to another development which
is in fact objectively correct namely
that whites are becoming a person to
become minority so you get the
Republican Senate House Leader wailing
that they're taking my country away from
me they were supposed to be supposed to
be our country and this is a real
sentiment that's been mobilized and
that's why you get what you see in the
Republican debates which the world is
looking at with kind of amazement
believes be going on but if you think
about the options available to a
political organization that's given up
pretending to be a political party and
it's just working you know for the one
percent if you like they don't have a
lot of choices and they actually have a
tire by the tail it's very clear that
the Republican establishment and the big
money most of it wants romney but the
constant
since they mobilized want anyone but
prompting it's too close to kind of
sanity how are you the close enough for
the big for the establishment you want
so every time somebody comes up and wear
it maybe there's a flood of money that
caused him to destroy them with attack
ads so you getting this isolation that's
been going on and as I say they have it
they may not be able to control when you
mobilize constituencies like that they
may get out of control actually we have
historical examples which aren't so
pretty so for example German
industrialists in the early thirties
figured they could control the Nazis
well didn't turn out that way these are
dangerous developers the Democrats have
their own problem they've abandoned the
white working-class almost completely
let's used to be their main constituency
and all of this is turning electoral
politics into racial politics if you
look at the statistics on how people
identify themselves is pretty
frightening could turn out very ugly
well let's go back to the monograph epi
monograph failure by design they point
out the analysts that it's not afraid
for everybody it's not a failure for the
designers of course and one percent it's
they're doing splendidly it is a failure
for you know the 99 percent to keep
imagery and it's a failure
country which is declining to be part of
what's called American decline and for
future generations is just burdens being
handed down to our children and
grandchildren not going away some of
them are these costs that are being
transferred are really colossal
infecting species threatening so one of
the most remarkable things that's going
on you know I'm just trying to look at
the world from the outside wouldn't
believe it we're systematically
destroying the possibility for future
tires and so a decent life that's I
understood around the world so there's a
lot of concern pocket are concerned even
in the United States but if you look at
their national polls that the u.s. again
is kind of off the spectrum there's much
less concern about environmental
catastrophe in the u.s. than in
comparable countries there's a lot but
not as much and that's certainly tied to
the fact that but this is an unusually
business run society highly class
conscious business world effectively
runs the society and tries to keep
things under control more so it's true
everywhere but more so than other
comparable countries and one of the
things they're doing and they're
perfectly open about it it's no secret
they put at the front page is run major
Trump end of the campaign to try to
convince the population that global
warming anthropogenic global warming is
just
a liberal folks if you're part of the
Republican charade this is part of the
catechism everyone has to repeat that
lockstep soul the real focus forget it
it's not going to happen and some even
have explanations like one of the
Republican disappointed in 2010 elected
in 2010 in and out cheers committee in
the house explained to the press that
can't happen because God told Noah that
he wouldn't have another flood look at
the Republicans every single one has to
repeat this it's claiming fears like
itit says maybe it's true he collapses
with the base riches under tremendous
pressure from the propaganda campaigns
organized by the Chamber of Commerce
they've our control him and it's to
affect immediate participate in their
own ways and that's it's getting to the
point where it's you know it's almost
surreal so just recently for example the
the government tried to it just
institute an inquiry would have been a
costless inquiry into the weather these
affect whether global warming is having
an effect on the highly erratic weather
patterns that have been coming along
Congress block the angry you can't
inquire into that and explain why if you
do you might be opening the door to
doing something about global warming and
you can't do it cuts back short-term
profit and if the world goes down the
tube that's the next generations problem
and these guys know what they're what's
happening at least many of them do not
illiterate the press barely reports it
but easily find it out so for example
the International Energy Association and
so a pretty conservative body I was
formed by Henry Kissinger they just came
into annual emissions reports their
latest one just came out a couple weeks
ago they said emissions are going way
beyond what anyone had predicted their
chief analyst said that in five visit
said that we have five years and would
try to do something about this after
five years the doors amount of clothes
will have reached the point roughly two
degrees integrated phrasing at which it
becomes irreversible and it starts don't
like you get these nonlinear processes
starts my way out so we're kind of
looking at what may be the final closing
of the door right before that the couple
of weeks before that the US Department
of Energy came out with its emissions
reports for 2010 the latest figures and
they were the highest varieties and
emissions on record far beyond the
worst-case predictions of the IPCC the
international group of scientists who
monitor these things at MIT where I have
that was not a surprise there's a
climate change group which for years has
been warning that the IPCC projections
are much too conservative and they're
plenty of scientists who believe this
but
kind of out of the discussion you know
talk about them well you know all of
this is this is I don't have to tell you
what this means but it means we are
purposely imposing a bird hack on future
generations which could be disastrous
that's serious another serious a lesser
bad enough but not as bad effect is just
the continued stagnation and living
standards under the one-percent can
survive at least for some time on
Finance and production from abroad like
at Foxconn but the 99 percent can't
really survive that way lets you produce
the things you need to here and there
are other effects the u.s. is slowly
losing its technological edge for well
understood reasons China up until
recently it's been kind of an assembly
plant doesn't produce much but it's an
assembly plant for the advanced
industrial countries on its periphery
and for multinational corporations but
manufacturing yields understanding and
learning it gives you a way to move up
the technological ladder you learn how
to do things it leads to innovation
design and so on and this is taking
place one of the domains which is taking
place quite strikingly is in solar
panels very rapidly growing industry
China's almost taken it over and not buy
cheap labor as much labor involved but
by careful planning by sensible
intervention to allow construction and
by just moving up just improving
low-cost manufacturing which gives you
ways of inventing and do I developing
new ideas that then take over it's
recognized here so the US Secretary of
Energy physicists true as in China
recently testified to Congress about how
we're going to lose the technology edge
but we can't believe that we're going to
invent the new technology if we're not
doing the manufacturing he gave this is
his exhibit a he toured one of the main
factories they said it's a high-tech
automated Factory it's not succeeding
because of a cheap labor it's developed
solar cells with world record
efficiencies and assigning a basis for
leaping ahead well that's going to go on
the decline of democracy is kind of
obvious on the front pages just bouncing
plea so for example in Washington the
big issue that we're supposed to be
concerned about as the deficit the
public doesn't agree the public take a
look at polls for a long time the public
says deficit isn't a big problem its
jobs that are the problem and done
strictly economic grounds very good
reason to think the public's right and
that's actually recognized even by the
most prestigious conservative economist
so there isn't any economics
correspondent and the world is more
highly regarded in the
and Martin wolf natural times he writes
that the US fiscal position is not an
urgent issue the u.s. is able to borrow
easy terms the astonishing feature of
the federal fiscal position is that
revenues are forecast to be a mere
fourteen percent of GDP in 2011 far
below their post for average of roughly
eighteen percent this non-american can't
understand what the fuss is about in
1988 at the end of Reagan's term
receipts were eighteen percent of GDP
tax residue has to rise substantially if
the deficit is too close and we know
where has to rise from it has to rise
from those who have the most income
they've been radically under
there may be a fiscal problem but it's
because we don't need in the revenues
that we had in the reagan years well it
is astonishing but it's easy to
understand it's a demand of the
financial institutions of the super-rich
and in a radically declining democracy
that's what counts so as an instrument
of class war the policies that the
public strongly opposes make perfect
sense well I should say that wolf has no
doubts about the source of the financial
crisis it says it's the result of an
out-of-control the financial sector
that's eating out the mark modern market
economy from inside just as the larvae
of the spider was eats out the host in
which it's been laid and there's good
evidence that he's right what's going on
you're too in a different way well even
if you keep to the secondary issue of
the deficit the radical the client
democracy is very striking so the public
has views on how to deal with the
deficit the views of public called the
poll after poll is raised taxes on the
very rich I get them back to what they
were and nobody's calling for getting
them back to where they were during the
great growth periods fifties and sixties
of a way higher but just you know say
back to the 90 so taxes on the rich and
preserve the the benefit system Social
Security and Medicare the
it's like even tea party adherence agree
to that they don't want you to touch
Social Security and Medicare well that's
the financial institutions demand the
opposite so therefore it's the opposite
that's happening no taxes on the rich
and carve away at the week benefit
system that's again part of the
catechism and the Democrats just kind of
go along because then I disagree that
much there is something that isn't even
discussable and that's the obvious way
to deal with the deficit is traceable
basically to two things one is a huge
military spending which is I'd say
that's untouchable so we don't do
anything with that but the other thing
which is very definitely touchable is
the completely dysfunctional health care
system the US has the only private eyes
world as that has more than twice the
per capita costs of comparable countries
and some of the worst outcomes look at
mortality infant mortality and so on
he's not very good well it's it has been
I think pretty well demonstrated that if
we had a healthcare system like other
industrial countries hardly utopian
there wouldn't be any deficit in fact it
actually is surplus but you can't talk
about this and you can't talk about this
because the financial institutions are
too powerful and in a declining
democracy it doesn't matter what the
facts are the matter what the public
wants it's pretty dramatic well these
have been major issues for years going
back to the Occupy movement are there
now much more prominent on much better
understood because the Occupy movements
but we should recognize thinking about
them that there are pitfalls that you
have to pay attention to one bit full
potential one has to do with tactics so
the tactic of occupying space has been
brilliantly successful and has great
impact but you know tactics have a kind
of a half life after a while they start
having diminishing returns people don't
like if you have to do something else
and at some point I think it's maybe
it's now the Occupy movements has to go
to a broader objectives they just have
to reach out to the expand into broader
communities that engage much broader
communities in the effort
have been successfully initiated
actually there is one important step
that's going to take place in a couple
of days a few days ago then chaves one
of the better civil rights activists
along with some Occupy Wall Street
representatives that an ounce the what
they call occupy the dream they want to
forge an alliance between the old civil
rights movement the Occupy movements and
it's going to start with the
demonstration planned and Washington on
mark Luther King Day which is quite
appropriate that was King's dream as you
know he was of course assassinated here
when he was supporting a sanitation
workers strike and on his way to
Washington to launch a try to launch a
poor people's movement well the noon
coalition they're saying calling what
they're planning an American spring
meaning inspired by the Arab Spring and
it could happen but will take dedicated
effort well the moons have been
criticized in the press not issuing
demands which is partially true so they
haven't tried the four injured party
line to which everyone must ask them
here like the old Stalinist parties or
like the Republican party today is very
similar
but that part that much is good I think
so quite spontaneously without any
special planning they have encouraged
the kind of letting 100 flowers bloom
lots of ideas but demands have emerged
in fact from the very first day many of
the demands are quite feasible
significant feasible very much within
reach so for example things like a
financial transaction tax tax which
every have number of countries works
very well that could have an effect on
cutting back a short term a speculative
manipulations which are a huge waste and
take the economy or just having a sane
health care system I mean it's not
utopian to say why don't we have a
health care system like other countries
and there are other measures like
efforts to allow working people to
exercise the right of Free Association
card check for example which Obama
settings have as a priority that dumped
pretty quickly the and it could reach
well beyond that and we're thinking
about it so another goal is achievable
is a shift from managerial control of
corporations to what's called
stakeholder control controlled by the
workforce community no that's not a
utopian idea in fact if you look at
standard work and business economics
it's actually discuss
proposed so one of the standard academic
studies of the modern corporation points
out that nowhere is it written in stone
that the short-term interests of
corporate shareholders deserve a higher
priority than all other corporate
stakeholders that means the workforce
the community and the rest of the
society that's affected by corporate
decisions other than I think the reason
why the Occupy movements shouldn't be at
least as imaginative ambitious as the
standard business literature that can
reach very far
there had back at night most probably at
the beginning of this process young late
70s there was one of the early moves to
try to shift the economy was the
decision of the US Steel to close down
some of their major plants in Ohio
Youngstown Ohio big steel steel Center
effective built the communities and so
on they want to close them down well the
the Union and the community with
considerable outside support offered to
buy the plant and running themselves
steel company didn't want to do that not
for economic reasons but I think for
class reasons not a good idea let people
think about that so the issue went to
court and the lid by storm Lynn Lake
long time civil rights labor activist
they made it to the courts they didn't
win in the courts but if they had more
support that would have could easily won
however Sanders are often they often
carry their own success with them they
leave a kind of a germ of ideas you can
follow and it happened so in these parts
of Ohio there's been quite a spread of
work around enterprises not huge ones
but quite a lot has very book on it if
you're interested by gar alperovitz
who's been directly involved and this
could go far beyond that so a couple of
years ago President Obama essentially
july's the auto industry it took it over
was collapsing there were a couple of
things that could have been done one
thing that could have been done is what
was done they reconstructed and hand it
back to same or similar people who run
it privately another possibility would
have been to hand the industry over the
stakeholders the workforce in the
community and have them produced things
that the country very badly needs for
example one thing the country really
badly needs is a high-speed rail you see
this
a lot more than a safe France or Japan
where it's very because the size of the
country the scale and so on well
interestingly at the very same time that
Obama took over the auto industry he
sent his Transportation Secretary food
to Spain to get contracts from Spanish
companies to build high-speed rail
installations in the United States and
this is kind of sick here we have the we
have those skilled workforce and the
installations we have the interest with
the resources but the decisions of the
designers those on the economy said we
don't want it so therefore you don't do
it well there are many other cases of
guys better on westnedge a convention
this takes public awareness and support
and the Occupy movement could provide
that these are old and which move in
that direction you're actually moving to
radical reconstruction of the society
along different lines but it's feasible
within region partly being done well the
achievements of the above-mentioned more
but the changes to finish the
achievements of the Occupy movements
have another dimension which is quite
significant especially in a country like
this one of the most significant
achievements of the Occupy movements has
just been to create authentic
communities that people who work
together for common n who support each
other they have a common kitchen or
common library or health services or
common assemblies where they talk about
things so on that's extremely important
in a country
this has been tremendous efforts to
atomize people to make each people think
I'm alone I things for myself period
it's drilled into you from childhood you
should be out for yourselves and compare
of anybody else and it's kind of
interesting to know how long this has
been going on and how intensely so if
you go back to the 19th century at the
beginnings of the Industrial Revolution
was mostly eastern Massachusetts in it
was very lively labor chris it was run
by artisans from the town's say irish
artisans were lost an hour ago factory
girls young women riddick the farms came
and worked at the mills and so on quite
an interesting press avail a lot of its
or even read it issues with a great
far-reaching very independent i think
the period of the free express in the
country and they bitterly condemned the
industrial system which they said is
just taking away the Freedom and the
Liberty and the rights of independent
people free people they they believed
that standard slogan was that those who
work in the mills should own and run
them why should we follow the orders of
bosses that's kind of like introducing a
new aristocracy we thought we were free
of that in the mid 19th century it was
probably immature a large part of the
population certainly northern workers
regarded wage labor as fundamentally no
different from
slavery it was different from slavery
only and that it was temporary actually
that was such a popular idea that was
exploded under Republican Party back in
that roughly the period of the civil war
that we have to fight against chattel
slavery and against nature later people
should be free to run their own affair
their own factories the but one of the
main you know objections and a lot of
the anger was directed at once against
what they called the new spirit of the
age gained wealth forgetting all itself
just completely contrary to the most
elementary moral consciousness that free
people have well you know there's been a
150 years of trying to drive that into
people's heads and it's I think it's
been some success Snowdown st. new
spirit of the age but in these
objections it just below the surface it
keeps coming up all the time today or
maybe yesterday if God is the centenary
of the Lawrence strike the great textile
strike in lawrence mass and you remember
perhaps that the slogan of the strikers
with bread and roses we were bred we
want decent pay we want these working
conditions but we also want dignity we
want to dignified life roses and that
means control of their own lives and
control of what we do and so on control
of the institutions in which we work
this keeps coming up
again in the Lord's town strikes in the
early 70s in my senses it's kind of just
below the surface when the proper
impetus comes it will rise again and i
think the Occupy movements are another
position to bring them to the fore
friend again well if these bonds and
associations can survive the repression
which is of course inevitable that could
be the basis for really turning the tide
in a fundamental way and resuming the
struggles for freedom and democracy to
go way back and have been fought
throughout our history always efforts to
repress them they keep rising again
grows quite dramatically in the popular
movements for which Martin Luther King
emerged as a great leader and it had
many achievements undoubtedly not just
for african-americans were lots of
others helped carry forward large change
in consciousness of a quite a wide range
but it certainly felt far short of dr.
King's aspirations I'm sure you remember
his last speech here at Memphis couple
hours before he was killed in which he
said that he climbed the mountain top he
could see the promised land a sense that
he was not going to get there but he
promised the poor and the persecuted
that they would I said promise that's
very far from being fulfilled in fact is
going backwards but
leaves us with the responsibility and
the tasks to try to realize that dream
not an easy one but it's one that we
have to find ways to carry forward
spoke about the community that occupies
created the way that the library of the
kitchens and the General Assembly's
create a sense of togetherness but
occupies the criticized for its lack of
a leader secure how important is it that
occupy maintain an emphasis on community
decisions and what are the advantages of
a movement that doesn't have a strong
well most movements gain a lot of their
major successes apparently don't have a
leadership it takes a missile regiment
went in civil rights movement
for decades it really began to take off
roughly 1960 with black students in in
the South started sitting at lunch
counters form snake started writing
freedom buses or somewhere their
students joined them I'd finally sort of
created a swell that Martin Luther King
was able to kind of ride he would have
been the first to tell you that there
the way I did say repeatedly they're the
ones who created movement he was able to
come and then provide then he and the
SCLC Christian labour conference they
did provide organized leadership which
got somewhere but it ran into a brick
wall the as long as they were focusing
on you know racist sheriff's in Alabama
they got plenty of northern support
sunstate started about say 1966 5566
they were starting to talk about the two
crucial issues in American society first
of all the Vietnam War and secondly
poverty and class issues at that point
the brick wall window and it's because
there wasn't the kind
of popular organizing in the north where
the real problem was that made it
possible to attack this stronghold so
it's okay to have you know maybe leaders
will come out will help or won't help
but the main forces I think Oh typically
comes from the popular movements
themselves at what point you tried to
develop some kind of structured
organization on things as any kind of
formula for that it becomes the right
thing to do it but there are certainly
things the word i'm in a leadership can
will almost always try to power itself
that can under so it's a quite not an
answer to question that has to
the course of seam puts the sensible
thing to do next like for example these
Enterprise Development snow highland
oaks talking about to have some
coordination like its others but leaders
of these are they help coordinate and
support developments that are taking
place at the workplace that's the kind
of service that a kind of quayside
leadership and perform as a service I
said the laws of you follow that comes
you made a number that county made a
number of allusions to the role of
organized labor as a driver of social
movements in American history and
recently there has been a sort of an
effort by the labor movement to reach
outfit or occupying late organizations
and that to some degree there was a
little bit of apprehension that they
might be co-opted by those organizations
that they would lose some of their
authenticity on what would you see is
sort of the connection between a labor
interests and
my own feeling that there are the
dangers that you mentioned with my own
feeling at least is that unless the
labor movement is revitalized the way it
was in the 1930s this is going to be
dead that's most people don't most
people are workers 13 or another and
unless they become organized and active
it's Eddie anything that develops will
be something coming from the periphery
and I don't think it will engage to mass
of the population or probably should I
mean what they say take the Arab Spring
so that's not the countries are not the
same as ours but this things you can
learn the what you read is and the Sun
totally false that the Arab Spring is
led by a tech savvy young professionals
with you know social media Twitter and
so on there's a lot of truth to that but
take a closer look in Egypt main country
the one of the young people who
organized the january twenty fifth
movement that then took off have a name
they call themselves the April sixth
move why the April sixth movement well
because some you can't remember that in
the United States there's some things
you're not allowed to talk about that
one of them is labor at militancy that's
kind of off the agenda but it's not true
of other countries in the April sixth
movement
named april six because in april six
2008 the egyptian labor movement which
has been very active in militant for
years organized massive strike actions
throughout Egypt starting in the main
industrial installations elsewhere too
and this group of young professionals
very properly tried to help him out by
using their technical skills so they
called themselves the April sixth
movement well that was crushed by the US
bank dictatorship but it was just one of
many efforts and finally the this april
six movement really got to be
significant when the unions moved in not
unions because and I'll had the form
unions for the militant labor groups
moved in massively within a couple of
weeks and then you really got mass
movements pepper essentially the same is
true in too busy in fact if you look
over the whole realm of Arab Spring
activities that notice first of all that
most of them have been crushed the
dictators are very well in place and in
particularly they're in place in the
countries which the u.s. really cares
about the oil dictatorships your show on
to their the Gators and do anything they
like the but they have for one a couple
of places and those happen to be the
place
is where there has been a long labor
militancy in activism busy also has a
major labor movement way back were
dressed but broke through there's
actually good work on this if you're
interested is it a joke lino who's that
Stanford is the main person who works on
labor movements of the were called in
many countries release North Africa and
he's pointed out that I think he's right
that there's a very close correlation
between some degree of success in the
movements and the level of militant
labor participation in fact one of the
Egypt you know the old regime is still
in power there's a lot of things that
are wrong but there have been some
achievements and one of the major
achievements is that the labor movement
has broken through the repression so now
you can freely organize and their
strikes all over the place they're
forming independent unions for the first
time they may be able to unify the
unions that still has to be done to
dismiss the same at my system you know
they don't want to draw the analogous to
closely but I think something like that
will be true here too unless the labor
movement is part of it they'll drift off
especially the white working class that
will be drawn away by nativism you know
fear other tendencies that certainly
exist and it will turn out to be
regressive
I just one less comment about that I
mean they sound as if it's kind of
impossible but look back at the history
you live in a history of US labor US has
a very violent labor history that much
worse than other countries and that
again industrial Gunners again reflects
the fact it's a business run society to
a large extent very high I the class
conscious business class so repeatedly
labor has grown and developed and then
been crushed the most recent period
before now is the 1920s the winter there
was a lot of militant labor organizing
the early part of the century like the
Lord strike camp the Ludlow's direct
others during the Woodrow Wilson's Red
Scare right after the Second World War
were pretty much crushed the labor
movement was a crushing independent
thought a lot more pre awful time in the
1920s the labor movement was practically
dead there's one of the major labor
historians I'd recently David Montgomery
has a he was labor activist himself that
became an academic they were historian
one of his main books is called the rise
and fall of the American labor movement
and the fall is the 1920s in the 1920s
the situation of organized labor
so awful that conservative visitors from
England than Australia were appalled
that the way important people are being
treated hundreds of workers were being
killed in the United States at a time
when this just wasn't happening anywhere
else and the movements were pretty much
crushed in the 1920s you know the end of
history utopia the Masters be one well
ten years later totally different so I
don't think it's possible that's right
you can't answer my question with what
you just said but I think the situation
is different now because of
globalization I think whenever there's a
recession workers are the ones who
suffer the most like you mentioned
before the they're pitted against each
other they were coming so they prepared
the workers are pitted against each
other companies can threaten to move
from one state to another or moved to
Mexico and I think now I think the
numbers showed that you know that was a
plummeted for unions United States at
stand up I don't know something like
less than ten percent and with so many
people needing jobs and the wages going
further down and down then you know
Chief flavor coming from other countries
it seems like the states in a position
where it was really bad for working
people and you know you were talking
about violence before but this is a
different type of struggle that I don't
think we've seen before and I was
wondering if you think it's vital to our
society how's it has a wave of movement
well I agree on the present course under
prison assumptions about how the society
has to be designed and run I think
that's right but come back to what I
said before who says that corporate
executives should have a right to decide
where production scary down or how it
started out I mean you could you know
the hundred years ago there were major
struggles here against the sweatshop
labor great shirtwaist factory fire in
New York was just about a hundred years
ago where dozens of seamstresses would
kill you know well that led to efforts
to improve working conditions and there
can also be efforts to improve working
conditions in Foxconn where they make
your Apple computers can yell and they
certainly wanted the working people
there wanna workers your cooperate with
them in doing it and also restoring
these opportunities here for the kind of
production that the United States is
very well placed to carry out like say
solar panels or high-speed rail this
reason why that can be produced here
we've got the skilled labor you've got
the resources it's going to take what's
called industrial policy but that's used
for everything that's why you have
computers the internet and so on but
these are
choice and it and the question is whose
number on it is it going to be run by
people in communities in the workforce
for their own producing the things here
that people need or is it going to be
run in a way which will increase the
profits for investors and bankers that's
globalization or not these questions
arise we entered in different ways there
was a question down here someone had a
mic thank you for mentioning the time of
idiocy of climate change keeping a few
things in mind the witness of current
environmental NGOs the shock doctrine
and the occupied movement could you give
some comments on language in regards to
solving climate change over these next
important five years and how language
can be influential shifting the pattern
yeah I mean I the first White Swan
tobacco slightly I'm you know the sign
on my door says link was but linguistics
I have nothing to say about this people
should be careful not to kind of pretend
that their professional expertise gives
them some you know a special right to
talk about other topics I think it is a
question but it's just one thing about
common sense the likeness of course
used and modified to try to delude and
control people and we can we don't have
to accept it we can use it in other
words so take take the constant fixate
concepts like free market it takes a
concept globalization which is already
brought up in the last 10 years actually
they've been two major globalization
movements they one of them and they
actually have regular meetings the one
of the meats in Davos Switzerland that's
corporate executives government
officials Thomas Friedman writes about
flat earth those guys so there that's
the official globalization there are
other meetings which are called which
the terminology calls anti-globalization
the people themselves call it something
like alter globalization different kind
of globalization those are the meetings
that take place a in porto alegre brazil
world social forum well both of these
are concerned with international
integration in that sense they're both
involved in globalization but a very
different kind the ones who've eaten
Devas are concerned with international
integration in a manner which expands
and extends the rights of investors
lenders bankers wealthy professionals
and so on the ones who meet in porto
alegre or other issues with other
countries of the south they beat the
south they're interested in
international integration
interest of people so they bring
together people of a very wide range of
backgrounds and concerns farmers in this
compazine over that meets indigenous
people I mean take say it takes a
climate change the climate unity
constructive / proaches to climate
change the ones that might do something
are coming out of those meetings out of
davis and they're coming from the most
repressed people in the world indigenous
people in Bolivia for example in an
Ecuador where the indigenous populations
have finally been able in the last
couple of years to become a major force
in the political arena in fact in
Bolivia they elected their own president
run the country they have taken strong
steps their way in the lead
internationally on trying to do
something about global warming for
example both in Bolivia Ecuador there's
the laws and even in the Constitution to
grant rights to nature well you know
people in the North kind of laugh about
that you know we're too sophisticated
for that kind of
that's done they're going to have the
last laugh that's coming out of the
globalization that's being organized
carried out developed many ways by
people whose main concern is
globalization but in the interests of
people and interests of their children
the interests of coming generations so
that's called anti-globalization but we
don't have to accept this terminology
and it brings over anybody look of
course the terminologies are manipulated
on the same international affairs so
what's the biggest issue today in u.s.
foreign policy and national policy is
the threat of Iran today just articles
in the press this morning about how the
United States is going to deal with the
threat of your rent by cutting off their
experts was supposed to latest cutting
off our experts how would we describe
that you know well we describe it as an
act of war in fact that's defined as an
act of war you take a look at policy
makers they say attempts to manipulate
the financial system that cut back our
experts is an active war we have to
react with nuclear weapons but when we
cut off their exports that's presented
as you know as humane
to try to improve the world is it ain't
different in fact what is the threat of
the rent that we're trying to prevent
I'm just greeted all the time it's the
most threatening thing in the world what
exactly is very authoritative answer
then mainly from the Pentagon and US
intelligence they provide regular
reports to Congress on global security
what's called security it's another or
well as and of course they talk about it
ran and if you look at the reports you
can pick up on the internet no we were
not the present they say it's not a
military threat and they go out and see
what the threat is it turns out that the
threat is deterrence the threat is they
might deter the United States and dis
clients from carrying out free use of
violence so therefore we can't tolerate
that was it tell us about us is that
amico a threat that it might prevent us
from resorting to violence freely the
other threat is that there's another the
quiz good point if you like then they
that Iran that tries to destabilize its
neighbors how does it destabilizes
neighbors it tries to expand this
influence into neighboring countries
that's destabilization on the other hand
we stabilize the neighbors by invading
them
that's like this message is so deeply
ingrained that you sometimes think one
of my favorites is former editor foreign
affairs the major establishment
international affairs journal that kind
of in a good the world scholar he was
once writing about the way we overthrew
the government of chile 33 said we had
to do it we had to destabilize chile in
order to establish stability and that's
not a contradiction if you live in the
or will in language of educated
discourse stability means they follow
our orders and the destabilizing means
moves towards independence which they
don't followers well you know this we
don't have to accept that terminology
and anywhere you look you find examples
is all over the place it's but but you
don't have to be a linguist to figure
this out you just have to think a little
which was actually a bit of a follow up
on me previous question about language
my impression is that there's a lot of
wasted wasted effort wasted iron wasted
a wasted the electronic ink etc from
people failing to agree on what they've
gone with are talking about once I'm in
the Occupy movement
I think a theme in your top has been the
apparent tension between capitalism and
democracy if you would tell me precisely
what you mean by capitalism by democracy
and what are depending the fundamental
tensions between them what what do you
mean by capitalism what do you mean by
democracy and what are the fundamental
tensions between them yeah that's a good
question these terms are almost totally
meaningless one of the ways of
preventing rational discussion is
emptying terms from any real meaning so
what is capitalism's but it's very quick
that's supposed to be us capitalism it's
supposed to be a system based on the
market where the government doesn't
interfere with the market I mean just
that our system I'm do you use a
computer that d is the internet define
an airplane where'd that come from it
came from the state sector do you do
almost entirely not totally but all the
hard work basic work comes from that has
comes with a very dynamic state sector
of the economy for decades and then it's
handed over to private enterprise for
profit takes these jobs who everyone was
talking about
died recently this undoubtedly a very
brilliant to the marketer he turned he
took the technology and the science the
innovations that had been developed by
decades of work primarily in the state
sector and he turned them into
marketable commodity okay that's a
talent but is that is that what
capitalism I'm in some kind of state
capitalism but then every system in the
world is some kind of state capitalism
but what about democracy well you know
democracy over there said we know the
rich you know we know what you learn in
eighth grade but if you look at the
history of democracy there are issues
that are fundamental and that had been
debated for centuries so let me take one
which is quite critical energy to the
founding of this country and it also
goes back to classical greece won the
first major book on politics is
Aristotle's politics which he discussed
various kinds of political systems
didn't like any of them decided
democracies probably at least bed or the
best but he noticed the problem with
democracy
James Madison and the Constitutional
Convention notice the same problem the
problem is that in a democracy if people
if everyone has an equal vote then the
poor will be the great majority will get
together and they'll find ways to take
property away from the rich so in
Madison's discussions of the
Constitutional Convention if you look
back he was fused England as the model
of course he said well if in England
suppose you allowed everybody to vote
well the poor people with carry out
measures behind that we now call and
reform Aristotle made essentially the
same point and they both thought that
this would be unjust to be unjust to
take away cooperative things from the
ridge so they both had solutions but
they had opposite solutions Aristotle
solution was to eliminate inequality and
he proposed what we would call welfare
state measures that's sort of a city so
things like communal meals you know
other things to make everybody more or
less middle class more or less equal he
said well would you do that this problem
would arise the Madison had the opposite
conclusion he said undermine democracy
so the system that was established here
is one designed to make sure that
democracy doesn't function you look at
the constitutional system which everyone
supposed to you know the original list
the tea partiers are summarized worship
take a look at it power and the
constitutional system is vested in the
Senate the Senate is Madison pointed out
have to be the wealth of the nation the
more responsible set of men the ones
most removed from the population so
there was no vote for senators vote went
through the legislators which are
controlled by the wealthy so you keep it
the wealth of the nation and they're the
ones who are who have to run the country
then of course you have the House of
Representatives in the constitutional
system they have very little power and
they're too close to the people you know
keep voting for them the executive was
just an executive not an emperor like
today it was somebody who administered
things so power was in the hands of the
wealth of the nation and had to be that
way because as Madison put it a primary
task of government is to protect the
minority of the opulent from the
majority if you don't have that killer
the gist system well that's one kind of
democracy another kind of democracy is
our social democracy we had try to carry
out social measures which will put
everyone you know more or less on a par
economically than they could make their
own choices which democracy do we want
well that's been battled about for 200
years
the United States that's a main theme of
American history which some could in
these words but which kind of democracy
is it so it takes a very interesting one
concept that's extremely interesting
right up till this present moment is the
concept person okay so you look at the
Constitution the Fifth Amendment says no
person shall be deprived of rights
without due process and speedy trial and
so on well what did they mean by person
suppose your Justice Scalia your
original list you wanna what they meant
by person well they certainly didn't
mean the indigenous population they're
not persons you can take away their
rights you could kill him drive away
anything you want sit in on persons what
about blacks and their incursions in
fact if three-fifths persons if you look
to set up the slave owners get more
votes and what about women or they
couldn't vote in fact they couldn't even
serve on juries freely until the 1960s
that's what they achieved Minh to the
civil rights movement so you know what
about people who don't own property well
they're marginally persons because there
were all kind of constraints of waiting
it boo so person was a very narrow
concept much an hour than human being
when you get to the Fourteenth Amendment
right at the Civil War essentially
repairs that wording but by that time
the blacks black slaves had been
elevated from three-fifths two persons
technically actually look
run run through the history but it's
still not persons that's where they're
sent to jail Livan massive poverty gain
elements of personhood in about nineteen
twenty-four I think when they think that
was a year when women were allowed to
vote but it literally wasn't until the
civil rights movement that they could be
allowed to serve on juries really done
they could in the north but not most of
the country so they weren't real persons
meanwhile the concept person since the
14th amendment has been both expanded
and contracted by the court not by
legislation famously has been expanded
to include collectivist legal fictions
established and maintained by state
power oracle corporation's so there are
persons and in fact almost all the cases
brought under the Fourteenth Amendment
or for them not for freed slaves and
since then that's been greatly expanded
so in the trade agreements like sayin
aston and corporations have rights way
beyond persons for example General
Motors invests in Mexico has to have
what's called national treatment means
it has to be treated like a Mexican
company if a Mexican comes to New York
that s for national treatment
many other ways that grates way beyond
persons the big Supreme Court decisions
like Buckley v Valeo which decided that
money and speech and then Citizens
United a couple years later that tells
these fictitious creatures entities that
they are persons who are permitted to
vile actions other real persons can't so
the concept have been greatly expanded
it's also an hour the Fourteenth
Amendment says no person shall be
deprived of Rights that what about
undocumented engines well you had to do
something about that so they're not
persons literally take a look at the
judicial record from then on it keeps
redefining that it just came up in
recent court cases with evolving
Guantanamo in which job committed aliens
don't have personal rights so they're
not persons well you know this all has
to do with how many what democracy is
but what would it mean to be a person
these are all decisions based on you
know power authority social struggle
which changes them sometime so women got
the right to vote let's say but they're
not kind of you can't pick them out of a
dictionary these are not concepts and be
defined in a dictionary they're defined
in the course of complex social struggle
class struggle
other kinds of struggle and that's where
they get their meaning and I think
that's true of capitalism's through
democracy whatever other current terms
you mentioned the role like this I'm not
now I am going to bring evening to a
close we've been listening this evening
to and quiet resolute Laden fact Laden
analytic dissident voice that offered no
simple solutions no easy slogans that we
can take away a give us lots of food for
thought gods of food for reflection
that's what we aim to offer on an
ongoing basis with the communities in
conversation series so again I ask you
to please go to our Facebook page like
us join us again and please thank
