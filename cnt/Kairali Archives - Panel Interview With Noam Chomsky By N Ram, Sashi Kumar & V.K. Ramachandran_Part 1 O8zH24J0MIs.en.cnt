welcome with this special program on
Kyra Lee channel channel this is a panel
conversation between Professor Noam
Chomsky of University Professors
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
nology and two leading experts in the
field of mass media
who is editor of frontline and also a
business sportscaster and and Shashi
Kumar the chairman of the Media
Development Foundation which has
established in Chennai na the nation
college of journalism lism Noam Chomsky
is perhaps the world's most renowned
known academic scholar he is the founder
of none of the modern modern science and
linguistics six he is a social theorist
activist media critic and author of many
books philosopher and a great
inspiration to people involved in anti
imperialist activism all over the world
I shall not take too much I should not
take any further time in fact in
introducing professor Chomsky and the
method of this program will be that our
two panelists will raise questions to
which professor Chomsky will respond we
will begin with the discussion of the
present international situation and
crisis in Afghanistan and go on to
discuss other issues in fields with
professor Chomsky Jung would you like to
begin
professor Chomsky Noam we are now been
told that the evidence has come because
it has been widely perceived that the
United States and its allies in this new
war against terror that's what it's
called have been unable to produce
concrete evidence but has the situation
radically changed with what is reported
in the newspapers
right now that the Sunday Telegraph for
the UK has obtained a videotape which
shows that Osama bin Laden is claiming
authorship of the of the September 11
crimes for himself and al-qaeda does
this make a world of difference in how
we should view this situation well there
is first of all a small lesson in how to
read the newspapers and disregard the
headlines and turn to whatever content
there isn't a story I didn't see the
videotape of course but from the story
that has been reported there's nothing
that says we did it or I did it or al
Qaeda did it or anything of the sort in
fact the statement that's reported is
very familiar it's what I see every time
I turn on BBC and CNN except that I see
it
said by Tony Blair or George W Bush what
he's what they say on television to all
of us day after day is there's two kinds
of terror there's the kinds I carry out
which is good terror and the kind you
carry out which is bad terror and that's
exactly what Osama bin Laden says this
is two kinds of terror we do it it's
good terror you do it it's bad terror
they are different Osama bin Laden's not
identical to Bush in Blair he's much
more modest so Osama bin Laden says we
will drive you out of our lands Blair
and Bush also say we will drive you out
of our lands but they mean different
things
if someone bin Laden means Muslim lands
Blair and Bush mean the world or the
universe which is correct that's their
lands that's the Imperial heritage so
they say we will drive the evil namely
what we don't like out of the world and
some of bin Laden says we will drive
evil what I don't like out of Muslim
lands but apart from that that you can
translate up and back very easily
between the two of them so it's a
familiar statement it takes another
difference I guess
that while Bush and Blair are happy to
take credit for the terror and violence
that they are carrying out there's no
question about looking for evidence
they're applauding themselves for
carrying out the violence of some of the
laden basically there's nothing he says
yes I think it was legitimate but that's
it now I know you've been spending many
of your waking hours giving interviews
and responding to questions and I
personally find it extremely helpful the
questions you raised and responds as an
analytical framework you you begin by by
assuming stating two assumptions about
two conditions that would you like to
state that for this discussion well the
in the talk that you're referring to I
began by saying that I'm assuming two
things one is that the terrorist acts of
September 11th were in fact major crimes
maybe crimes against humanity as Mary
Robinson the UN High Commissioner for
Human Rights called them I think that's
reasonable and the second assumption is
that we should be committed to trying to
reduce the likelihood of such crimes not
just that one but many others and in
fact the context is that there is an
ongoing crime which considerably
outweighs even the atrocities of
September 11th and that is the crime
being committed against the people of
Afghanistan the people living in
Kandahar and villages there are innocent
people I mean they're they didn't carry
out the bombing whoever carried out the
bombing of September 11 that wasn't them
the attack of September 11th but they're
the ones that were under attack under
severe attack we don't know the details
because when you kill were miserable
people nobody counts it's just normal
behavior but it's very likely in fact
almost certain that the
a number of victims of the us-british
attack on Afghanistan the far exceeds
the September 11th crimes and as it
continues it will they'll pale into
insignificance in comparison so those so
when we talk about stopping crimes we
don't just we do mean a terrorist
attacks like September 11 but which is
unusual in fact historically unique
because of the target I mean it's the
West does this to other people other
people only do it to the west so that's
unique but the ongoing crimes that are
being committed right now
which are far more serious are in fact
historically quite normal that's simply
how Europe conquered the world
no no continue so no if there's any
attention you've also spoken about the
irrationality the injustice of the of
the target of the of the war and that
it's not the people who committed the
crime who must face the punishment no in
fact no one even pretends that the
people who live in some village in rural
Afghanistan committed the crime or even
knew about it they are being targeted
because they're weak their their
traditional targets they're weak they're
poor they're miserable they can't fight
back so therefore you destroy them I
mean there's a long history here we
don't know if they I mean maybe the most
instructive part of the history is right
after first the first world war after
the first Britain of course mostly
controlled that area including India at
that time and after the first world war
Britain was no longer in a position to
control this huge region by direct force
it had been weakened by the war so it
turned to air power which was a kind of
a new technology at that time decided to
use air power to try to control the
native populations an interesting series
of events took place the
yeah Royal Air Force office in Cairo
asked permission from the war office in
London to use air power to deal with
what they called recalcitrant Arabs
Arabs is a very broad category includes
anybody Kurds Afghans anyone you like it
went back to Winston Churchill who was
in charge of the war office there were
some prick the other British embassies
were didn't like it the India office
thought it was a bad idea
this was right after I'm retired and
they were worried about the reaction in
India Britain started bombing people you
know were people over Churchill was
quite upset he was angry he said I do
not understand this squeamishness about
the use of he said poison gas against
uncivilized tribes the uncivilized
tribes he we thought was talking about
where Afghans and Kurds so I do not
understand this squeamishness about the
use of poison gas against uncivilized
tribes we should use any weapon
whatsoever that will save British lives
and maintain our control and poison gas
is a very good one because it will
inspire a lively terror among these
barbarians and enable us to control
poison gas at the time was the most
horrendous weapon there was the
counterpart to nuclear weapons today the
we don't exactly know what happened
afterwards
part of the reason is that no one in
England watched a look these records
were Declassified made public about 20
years ago as soon as I read them I
started writing about them and giving
talks about them there's been no
follow-up now we can be quite sure we'll
never fall if I find out the reason is
that
the British government 10 years ago
declared what they called an open
government policy so now we're going to
open up the government to public
inspection because we're so democratic
the first act of the open government
policy was to remove from the public
records office and presumably destroy
all records concerning the British use
of poison gas and air power to control
the uncivilized tribes so presumably
we'll never find out however this
continued the throughout the 1920s and
the early 30s Britain continued to rely
extensively on aerial bombing of
civilians which was a new terror weapon
at the time to try to control the
uncivilized tribes in fact in I think it
was 1932 there was an international
conference to try to which tried to at
that time there are many conference was
trying to reduce the threat of war and
violence
this one was concerned with constraints
to prevent the use of air power against
helpless civilians and Britain succeeded
in undermining the treaty and so it
never was passed Lloyd George very
eminent and respected British statesman
wrote in his diary this later came out
he was full of praise for the British
government for undermining this treaty
and what he said is we have to reserve
the right to bomb the niggers that's it
and you know MIT speech - it's done
deferred you make this actually quite
too many people split away that your
comparison between the action being
taken against Afghanistan and what the
sort of analogous response of Britain
would have been to the IRA bombing had
the bomb boss yeah and the thing i
already ira bombings of course we're not
the same scale was the World Trade
Center but it's a very serious one of
one of the bombs attempted to kill the
overs cabinet not as small
well how did Britain respond let's put
aside questions of feasibility which of
course are significant but one possible
possible response would have been to
bomb Boston where I live which happens
to be the main source of funding for the
IRA this is the Exile diaspora community
which raises money and very militant
policemen yeah yeah they're much more
like usual as is usually the case
diasporas tend to be much more militant
than home country so the Irish community
in Boston and other places is full of
fire and wants to want someone else to
do some killing and they provide
financing so they have to wait them out
and then of course they should have
wiped out west Belfast the Catholic
community where the IRA is based well
that would have been putting aside
feasibility that would have been
criminal idiocy criminal really and of
course it was never nothing couldn't
consider what they did do was sensible
yes when you talk about terrorism
factors and use of terrorism if I've got
you're right you you've said that state
terrorism all states are by definition
terrorists it's almost kind of almost
almost because a state is a system of
organized violence operating in the
interests of whatever domestic power
happens to be and that quite typically
leads to violence and repression I mean
it's not it's not automatic but it's
historically natural and the greater and
more powerful the state the more violent
it usually is following from that is
that no state can normally intervene
humanely in a situation like this I
think you have given two exceptions so
that it's interesting because one of
them belongs to India Indian
intervention in Bangladesh you think is
whatever the more humane intervention or
in consequence human cost we have to be
distinct I mean there are examples of
humane consequences not intention so but
so say destroying Hitler was a good
consequence but it wasn't oh
yeah or Vietnam invading all areas
didn't eliminate papad or India invading
to stop the terror in East Pakistan I
mean these were actions that had humane
consequences but
countess humanitarian interventions they
were not undertaken out of benevolence
they were undertaken out of power
interest and they happen to have humane
consequences and yet you late you are
talking about a space for a
paternalistic state a state which can
have a role in protecting its people
what what space or how much space would
you give the state
well I wouldn't give the state any space
people have a capacity to protect
themselves and sometimes they in our
just system of governance
they only decide only it's the best
possible way but the way that exists is
through participation in a quasi
democratic process in which people can
organize protection for themselves like
water facilities or security health
service or social security or education
or or self-defense you know that the
insofar as the state represents a
mechanism by which people acting for
themselves can cooperate as a community
to achieve some communal end that's okay
I don't happen to think that this
apparatus isn't best way of doing it but
it's the one we have on the other hand
that does not accord the state any
rights whatsoever I'm the state as an
entity has no rights zero it's as a
representative insofar as it's a
representative of the population then it
has the rights it represents the
interests and choices Democratic choices
of the population that's legitimate but
the state has no rights and if the state
acts on its own no if I could take you
back to the new war against terror
focused on war on Afghanistan the going
back to your analytical framework
question number one what's happening
right now I think there's a very
interesting you put the emphasis on on
stop masturbation as a professor method
what you called silent genocide because
people are rightly concerned about
killing of civilians what the Pentagon
calls collateral damage but this aspect
I think has got relatively little
attention although age eight agencies
may be relatively
attention by the choice of the
propaganda system the decision of the
propaganda system including BBC CNN the
New York Times and so on is to deflect
attention away from the atrocities that
are happening to marginal atrocities
that's quite typical so pick say the
Vietnam War there was tremendous focus
on the malai massacre small amount
horrible massacre a few hundred people
were killed by some half crazed
half-educated GIS and soldiers in the
field who didn't know what was happening
to them and they did commit a massacre
that massacre happened to be a marginal
tiny footnote to a mass murder operation
that calls called Operation wheeler
Walla WA which was a mass terror
operation one of many designed to
basically wipe out the rule and and and
demolish the rural population which was
the basis for the resistance for the
United States now there is no discussion
of the mass murder operation actually
there's some I wrote about it when the
data came out but that's not discussed
what's discussed is this little footnote
which you can blame on some poor
soldiers in the field who probably
didn't know who was going to shoot out
the next you don't blame the people
sitting in the air-conditioned offices
plant targeting b-52 raids on villages
and organizing mass you know these these
mass murderer operations and it's the
same here attention what are the
estimates of the number of people at
risk you think well the estimates mostly
come from the United Nations
other world food organization other food
and agricultural organization and others
and many aid agencies Oxfam and so on
and they're pretty consistent everyone
very much agrees and in fact the press
also agrees when it reports it prior to
the bombing there was a serious prior to
September 11th the situation was quite
serious there were maybe five or six
million people in Afghanistan who were
just on the edge of starvation and we're
being sustained by international food
aid on September after September 11th
immediately there was a threat of Mommy
and people were terrified naturally many
people started fleeing into the
countryside the international
organizations removed their
international workers so the only ones
they had left were local workers on
September 16th so five days later the
United States essentially ordered
Pakistan to terminate food deliveries
into Afghanistan that was the main
source of the food coming in that it was
interesting that there was no reaction
to that in the West and the day after
that I happened to be on radio and
television all over Europe which I did
for several months and I asked
everywhere I spoke Germany you know
England I asked is there any reaction to
this and there was no reaction anywhere
because that's normal it's normal for it
and it's correct that there's no
reaction this is the normal behavior of
the West towards its victims we want to
starve them to death we start with this
what it doesn't require is a major issue
that needs to be flagged and then it
continues I mean it continues by the the
estimates to get your point by the end
of the month at the end of September the
estimates were that the number of people
subject to on the verge of starvation
and needing immediate aid had risen by
50% so that's an extra two and a half
million people just as a result of the
threat of bombing the agencies warned
that if there's actual bombing it's
how much worse of course when the
bombing took place even the limited
amount of food that was coming in was
terminated later picked up to an extent
but nowhere near the it was winter tone
that you know as soon as winter's coming
most of the large parts of the country
are impassable can't get aid to people
when people flee to the countryside at
first there's two points to be made
about the fleeing first of all the
attacks on the cities are basically a
form of biological warfare when you bomb
a city and you destroy its electrical
supplies and its water supplies and it's
sewage supplies that's a polite way of
saying biological warfare you can
imagine contamination that's you know
that yes of course and the main cities
Kandahar ought to know there's probably
three-quarters of the population fled
when they flee to the countryside
they're fleeing to the most heavily
mined area in the world and the mind
there were mine clearing operations they
had to be terminated because of the
threat of mommy
so it's worse than it was before and
furthermore now there are u.s. cluster
bombs all over the place which are much
worse than land mines I mean these are
murders anti-personnel weapons designed
to kill people not the tank and they're
all over the place and they're
impossible to eliminate it requires a
technical knowledge that the Pentagon
won't provide in order to remove them
they're all over the world and Laos and
other places so now people are fleeing
into areas which are extremely dangerous
of the food agencies so the World Food
Programme and the Red Cross and others
have warned that the air drops are
extremely dangerous because they draw
people to places which might be very
dangerous to go into aside from the fact
that if you drop food somewhere it's not
going to go to whim
children and so on I mean you know man
I'll pick it up and take it to the
bazaar and so let's deal with this yeah
okay of course what's gonna happen
northern enhanced troops comes in
clears delicious in the yellow of the
other bus tells them in the bazaar and
then the others come with donkeys in
getting exact odd but what's in happen
and the World Food Program particularly
in the Red Cross did say that there are
circumstances under which air drops are
legitimate but what you have to do is
clear an area have local people there
you're on people there inform the
population that there's a safe area and
drop food in places where the worth is
an organization and you can give it to
the people who need it you know people
are sick or women children and so on
well this is just a propaganda operation
it's received scathing condemnation from
the aid agencies but this whole process
is killing an enormous number of people
now the details we don't know because
nobody looks but as compared with you
know that what's being looked at is what
you said the so-called collateral damage
so occasionally a bomb hits the wrong
target and then everyone goes and says
isn't it terrible we hit the wrong
target well you know a bomb will hit the
wrong target so that's an accident part
of the game part of the game but this is
purposeful murdering a murderous
slaughter so that probably millions of
these misleading to look at collateral
damage yes another missile you do it too
much weight it's some marginal
consequence like me live as compared to
a mass murderer did it to issues which
have appeared in norms work
one is the to give too much prominence
to one incident you know and not see the
entire context there's yet another with
a methodological point but she always
makes is that when you assess the deaths
caused by an attack you don't assess the
number of people who died in that
incident because if you if if five
people died when you destroy a
pharmaceutical factory and that
pharmaceutical factory is producing
life-saving drugs for millions of people
then those millions must count as part
of the victims of that much like
starvation death situation
so ancient exactly so it's a no and I
think this has of course appeared in
your recent controversy with Christian
with Christopher Hitchens is that you
don't just measure the number of people
who died then but all look at the
director Kennedy it's not just the
people who died in 91 true but since
then and that's all over the world I
mean takes a louse one of the first
countries in the world in the late 1960s
there was what was called a secret
bombing of northern Laos it was secret
because the media knew all about it and
refused to print it and I can tell you
that from personal experience from
meetings with the Editorial Board of the
New York Times and time-life and so on
the information was there they would not
print it I happened to be there shortly
after and interviewed refugees and so on
this was bombing in northern Laos had
nothing to do with the Indochina Wars
the government admitted that it's a poor
peasant area with which at that time was
the most became the most heavily bombed
area in the world not right now by now
there are millions literally millions of
unexploded what are called bomblets you
know the little pieces of cluster bombs
that don't explode is about a 20 30
percent failure rate presumably in order
to kill more people now now if a child
picks up one of these little things
if flechette scum out in murder if a
farmer hits one with a hoe the same
thing there there are literally millions
of them now the number of people dying
in northern Laos is not really known but
the aid workers church volunteer
demining groups I mean they estimate
thousands of killed a year in fact the
Asian Wall Street Journal there are Asia
correspondent Barry Wayne he accepted
the figure of 10,000 deaths a year as
possible and I didn't say it's true we
think could be possible
well that's going on right now you know
this is more than 30 years after the war
is over there's a British demining team
of volunteer Deema
team trying to deal with it the Pentagon
to this day will not give them technical
information about how to defuse the
unexploded bomblets well these are all
casualties of the Vietnam War
you know the Vietnam War may be over but
these people are still dying I mean the
people are still dying from cancer
because of chemical warfare in the South
they're dying
