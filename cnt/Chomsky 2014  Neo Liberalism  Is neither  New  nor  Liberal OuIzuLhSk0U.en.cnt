but I think we ought to take a closer
look at the constant for the
neoliberalism the first of all is not
new and it's not liberal neoliberalism
already his propaganda it's very old
old-fashioned class war old-fashioned
imperialism hbu liberalism is it
basically the programs that were imposed
on what became the third world you go
back to the 18th century actually the
17th century the main industrial and
commercial centers of the world were
India China and the difference between
the very rich and very poor was not very
great maybe 3 21 countries but something
happened that the main thing that
happened is that was called then
liberalism was imposed on colonial that
colonized regions they were compelled to
follow market principles the rich never
did the rich do not tolerate markets for
themselves for very good reasons to
destroy also this anal first England and
the United States and Germany France the
rest of 12 countries Japan imposed
highly state-directed forms of
development the United States was quite
striking you probably all know this
history but it's worth bearing in mind
the when the colonies were liberated
they got advice on sound economics from
the greatest economists of the day like
Adam Smith and the advice was follow the
principles of sound economics so what we
call neoliberalism don't have terror no
protection because that you can prove
interferes with maximal efficiency for
the colonies that meant use British
manufactured goods which are much better
than yours concentrate on which a good
ad would later came to be called
comparative advantage so to produce
agricultural product raw materials
cultural products of fish for so long
and take it disappears or British
manufactured goods and crucially don't
try to monopolize the commodities for
which you have a natural advantage and
the important most important one of
those days of course was cotton the
common was kind of like the oil with the
early Industrial Revolution what did the
colonies do exactly the opposite in
every respect very high terrors block
superior British manufacturers developed
your own textile industry later in the
century steel industry blocking superior
British products and so on all the way
across the line a massive state
intervention in the economy the
railroads you know the conquest of
territory extermination of the
population conquest of half of Mexico
slavery
most extreme interference with market
principles they go monopoly effort
strong efforts to monopolize cotton the
Mexican War was fought largely to try to
than the annexation of Texas to try to
obtain a monopoly of cotton after the
president's are very explicit about this
the Jacksonian presidents Tyler pull it
said yes if we can gain a monopoly of
cotton we can bring England to our feet
remember England was the big enemy that
was the powerful military state it was
blocking us expansion us couldn't
conquer Canada conquer cubital bridge
we're just as strong but we could bring
written to our feet if we could not like
cotton and came pretty close of course
out of the century the relations of
power shifted that's how the United
States developed that we're into the
present if you have a computer use the
internet to fly an airplane use the
pharmaceuticals you're using the
products substantially created in the
dynamic state sector of the economy
right to the present well that's how the
United States develop the way England
developed before stole technology from
the low countries which were more
advanced from Ireland from India of
course and the unis methods that are now
blocked by the World Trade Organization
and both piracy to develop but it became
became the most powerful industrial
state and in fact essentially without
exception this city states like Hong
Kong or minor exceptions but this is the
pattern of development of the rich
societies meanwhile market systems were
forced down the throat of the poor and
they became the third world that said
so now I effort so how is it applied to
the Nordic capitalism same way you're
right now is in the midst of the
extremely interesting process by which
they Europe would be going screaming
undemocratic in the wall street journal
for example though barrel pointed out
something was Fred they should take a
look at your article on trees no matter
what government is in power they follow
exactly the same policies it could be a
communist run government that the
government go to the right they found a
pretty much the same policies because
the policies are dictated in Brussels
the policies have determined by Brussels
bureaucrats and would so on the Nordic
countries are resisting a little but
it's being imposed by force himself
that's the and what if what it's doing
is taking on this policy of austerity
during recession on the heat of the IMF
but now recognizes that it's ludicrous
from an economic growth I am that
economists have been publishing papers
keep saying it's crazy it's a way to
destroy an economy they understand that
but the swimming the economy is not a
bad objected because the goal remember
it is to establish a futon amazing
precariat the goal is class war and that
means undermine and dis
well Thursday does and the Nordic
countries are partially then make to
this Sweden Norway to the one they're
holding back but it's the old policy of
the basic health policy of class war
which is constantly full
