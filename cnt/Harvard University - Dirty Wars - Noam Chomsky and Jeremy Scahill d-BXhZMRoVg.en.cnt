what an honor it is to be here with
Jeremy Scahill and Noam Chomsky and I
wanted to start with Noam responding to
Jeremy's investigations in the
description putting in the context of
the history of u.s. foreign policy well
I haven't get an email this morning from
a person who many of you know Fred
Brandt Fenn
he's a counterpart of Jeremy from back
in the 60s he's the person who worked
for years with enormous courage and
effort to try to expose what were called
the secret Wars the secret wars were
perfectly public wars in which the media
was we're keeping secret government and
Fred this is in Laos I was he finally
did succeed in breaking through and
tremendous exposure of huge wars that
were going on a war in northern Laos
attacking a peasant society that was so
remote from what was happening in the
Indochina Wars that many of them
probably didn't even know they were in
Laos actually with Fred I met many of
them in refugee camps after a CI a
mercenary army drove them out from areas
where they'd been in hiding in caves for
two years under intense bombardment he
then proceeded to help expose the even
worse wars in Cambodia and then the air
wars in general many of a background one
thing he what he pointed he's a great
admirer of Jeremy's I should say for
very good reasons that you just heard
and I hope will read and see but Fred
made an interesting point he reminded me
of a
by a high American official back in 1968
who fred was trying to get to speak it's
not easy to get these people to speak
but he did and this official he was
asking him why is this intensive bombing
going on of northern Laos nothing to do
with the war in Indochina just
destruction of a poor peasant society
one of the most malevolent acts of
modern history I think and he finally
official finally explained he said look
there's a temporary bombing of north of
the bombing of North Vietnam now we have
all these planes we have anything to do
with them so we'll bomb Laos okay I
think that's the lesson of history that
we should bear in mind and reading
Jeremy's exposures of first black water
and the mercenary army and and now JSOC
the so-called secret Army in secret the
same way the secret wars were secret if
you had a reporter who's willing to has
the courage and integrity to expose it
you can expose it these resources are
there they're growing they have a
self-generating capacity they're gonna
get larger and larger they're gonna want
more and more to do and if one target
disappears they'll be turned somewhere
else and as Jeremy hinted they'll be
turned here and there's history of that
too some of you want to read about it
there's a very important book by a
historian very good historian Alma al
McCoy who among other things studied the
history of drugs torture and so on but
he's a philippine historian mainly and
he did a study of the Philippine war the
u.s. counterinsurgency war in the
Philippines and the over a century ago
was a brutal
murderers war hundreds of thousands of
people slaughtered horror story and he
pointed out that at the time the after
the war was over when the sort of called
pacification began the US forces were
the Marines mostly in those days were
using the highest technology available
to develop a surveillance system over
the Philippine society so they could do
what what by our standards now at a
primitive level the kinds of things that
Jeremy described and they did and it's
turned the Philippines into a this is
Philippines a hundred years later have
never escaped from this Philippine
society is permeated by the consequences
of this long terror war but McCoy
pointed out something else he pointed
out that these measures from before the
first world war were very quickly picked
up domestically both by the British in
the United States and applied to a
surveillance and control techniques
within their own societies FBI here and
so on and that's what we can expect and
signs of it are already around the
resources are there they're self
generating they're going to grow they're
going to develop if they if if the
current targets disappear they'll move
on to new targets because that's the
nature of these systems just like the
planes who had nowhere to bomb so they
decided the center of the bomb northern
Laos and they'll come home already
happening and we can expect more and
more of it I think that's the historical
background they should very much be kept
in mind one thing that's important to
keep in mind is that very little of what
this administration or the Bush
administration did was actually new
ideas there they were there are old
existing ideas and resurrections of
certain plans and and programs I mean if
you look at the Phoenix program in
Vietnam which was this
nation program that was being run in
Vietnam there are very serious parallels
to what the United States was doing in
Iraq you know people the dominant
historical narrative is that the surge
won the Iraq war and general you know
Petraeus had he not gone down for you
know the the only thing that seems to be
capable of taking down the powerful is a
so you know what what what they what
they do in their top-secret chambers
they can wage all the so-called secret
Wars they want but if they do something
in their own secret life then you know
then you can you can bring them down but
but Petraeus is often celebrated as this
sort of hero who won the Iraq war
because of the surge but in reality you
had this merciless killing campaign that
was being run by General Stanley
McChrystal and Admiral William McRaven
where they were just bumping off you
know the leadership of any cell that
would pop off pop up but also just
killing a tremendous number of people in
general and and and so you you had
military figures that grew up in a
certain era with an understanding of
these programs and when when Cheney and
Rumsfeld came into power with with Bush
they really saw even before 9/11
happened saw the the historical moment
that they had in front of them to sort
of redraw maps and and implement a
vision of the world where iran-contra
was a noble act
and sort of the model for how the US
should be conducting its foreign policy
I don't know if you many of you know
this but Cheney was in Congress at the
time that iran-contra was being
investigated and he authored the
Minority Report in the house defending
iran-contra and and and viewed it as a
sort of heroic necessary action and and
they they have this view of the unitary
executive the idea that when it comes to
these national security issues that the
White House is essentially a
dictatorship and that Congress is only
function is to fund the operations but
not be involved with overseeing them or
having any meaningful oversight of these
operations and President Obama really
had an opportunity to roll back some of
the executive branch power grabs that
Bush and Cheney had engaged in and
instead he sort of doubled down on
and and has been waging is unprecedented
war against whistleblowers and using the
Espionage Act and reserving the right of
the state to keep secret from the
American people evidence that would
would indicate why someone was being
assassinated to keep secret to use the
state secrets privilege in repeated
lawsuits brought against former
officials or torturers having cases
thrown out of court using the full power
structure of the executive branch in the
same excessive way that was being used
under Bush and Cheney can you talk about
McRaven and gar des oh that's a lot yeah
that's a so one of the stories in the in
the book and also you'll see this in our
film one of the characters in our in our
film is Admiral William McRaven who is I
think one of the most powerful military
figures in modern US history
McRaven is the current commander of
SOCOM the Special Operations Command the
in charge of all Special Operations
activity across the globe in more than a
hundred countries but McRaven was
actually an original member of SEAL Team
six the Naval Warfare Development Group
DEVGRU it's called now he was an
original member of SEAL team 6 and spent
much of his career in the shadows of of
covert and clandestine u.s. military
operations and he would have been
forward deployed to Afghanistan shortly
after 9/11 but he had injured his back
in a parachuting accident at a training
exercise in California where there was a
where his SEAL team was based at the
time and so instead of forward deploying
to Afghanistan Admiral McRaven was
tapped by General Wayne downing who was
coming up with the with the process for
putting people on these kill lists after
9/11 and trying to take down all of the
leadership of al-qaeda or anyone that
they could attach to the 9/11 attacks
and and downing asked Admiral McRaven to
come and advise the National Security
Council people think of the national
security
so is this huge body it's it's the
President the Vice President the
Secretary of Defense and the Secretary
of State and then staffers but it really
is just the core officials who dictate
this policy so if the if the NSC is
making decisions about targeted killing
it's really the the principles that are
that are doing with National Defense
national security counterterrorism so
McRaven became the adviser to the most
powerful officials in the US government
in developing how to implement the
hunting down and killing of Osama bin
Laden and and and others and in the at
the beginning there were some by some
estimates between seven and two dozen
individuals that were put on this list
for McGinn he was killer capture but the
emphasis was often on on kill and
McRaven saw firsthand how the White
House worked and he learned a great deal
about the politics of an administration
because he was there helping to craft
the policy but he would later then run
when he became the head of all special
operations forces so McRaven is there
for a couple of years and then it ends
up going to Iraq where he was the deputy
commander of the Joint Special
Operations Command under Stanley
McChrystal who was very close to Dick
Cheney Cheney had gotten him a
fellowship at the Council on Foreign
Relations and McChrystal was the
commander of JSOC for much of the Bush
administration
McRaven is working under McChrystal
running the kill campaign in Iraq and
and coordinating all of these actions
against both the what was called al
Qaeda in Mesopotamia or al Qaeda in Iraq
Abu Musab al baqarah Zarqawi and also
going after moqtada al-sadr forces and
others so he sort of understood both
ends of the the game how it was run in
the White House and then how it was
implemented in the field and when
President Obama came into office the two
people who were responsible for the most
covert sensitive operations being run by
primarily Cheney and Rumsfeld outside of
the chain of command were general
McChrystal and Admiral McRaven and they
became the two most influential figures
in shaping the Obama administration's
counterterrorism policy and so President
Obama really empowered those forces and
actually
had McRaven in the white house helping
to shape the policy not just implement
the military actions but actually
shaping policy and most people had never
heard of Admiral McRaven and of course
he's now a kind of iconic figure because
he commanded the raid that killed Osama
bin Laden and of course Disney tried to
trademark SEAL Team 6 after the bin the
bin Laden raid it's a true story and and
but but what I the way that I discovered
the identity of Admiral McRaven was in
February of 2010 there was a raid in
Gardez in Afghanistan and pockets and a
US Special Operations team had
intelligence that there was a Taliban
compound and the people living in a
particular compound in this area were
members of the Taliban and were plotting
attacks against American forces and they
raid this compound in the middle of the
night and they end up killing a number
of men and two pregnant women and it
turned out that this was not a Taliban
family in fact they weren't even ethnic
Pashtun they were they were from a
minority ethnic group in the province
and they the man of the house was a
senior Afghan police commander who had
been trained by the US forces and and
his family showed me his documents he
had actually been trained by a private
security company called M PRI which is
made up of very of high-ranking former
military officials intelligence
officials and others and so these women
were killed this Afghan police commander
who had fought with US soldiers against
the Taliban and against the Haqqani
network in his province and and whose
house was filled with pictures of him
and US soldiers smiling and these
pictures had had just been killed and
when the when the commandos that rate
the US commandos had that raided the
house realized that they had killed
these women and that the men that they
had killed were not in fact Taliban and
that what they were doing that night was
the most anti Taliban of things they
could have been doing which was to be
having a party with live music
celebrating the naming of a child and
men were dancing and playing instruments
and it was this loud boisterous party
and we have their cell phone video from
that night
so they raid this house these people are
killed instead of saying
while we we really messed up and owning
it and that stuff happens every day in
Afghanistan people are getting killed
all the time that have no attachment
whatsoever to the Taliban or al-qaeda or
the Haqqani network and the US will
often just pay them a little bit of
money and move on and it never makes it
into the papers that wouldn't have been
out of place but instead of doing that
they dug the bullets out of the women's
bodies and then they told their
commanders that what had happened in the
compound that night was a was a Taliban
ambush of this family and that they had
come upon these women who had been
killed by the Taliban and then they
they're releasing that well no this is
actually an honor killing and the women
were killed by their own family members
and-and-and and they put out a press
release and and spokespeople made these
statements saying that this that the US
soldiers were essentially heroes that
had gone in there and saved everyone
else but then the the the family members
because they were a prominent family one
of the the fathers of the women was the
vice dean at guard as university who
spoke fluent English started calling
reporters and telling people you know
this is not what what they what NATO is
saying then a very great reporter named
Jerome Stark he actually went down there
he writes for The Times of London and
interviewed the family members and did a
story saying that this was a NATO raid
he didn't know it was JSOC at the time
that the this was a botched NATO raid
and that NATO had tried to cover it up
and he told the story of these families
and when Jerome Starkey did this NATO
did something extraordinary they named
him in a press release and said Jerome
Starkey of the Times of London is lying
they actually accused him of lying and I
mean that could that could have ended
Starkey's career and Starkey to his
credit kept pushing and pushing and
ended up doing a number of stories and
got close to that family and Ric and I
also went to this family and filmed with
them and you see this in our video and
tell this story and tell the story of
what happened to Jerome Starkey as well
so so media attention is is is focused
in now on this village and this one
families compound and eventually monado
calls up Starkey and they said were
about to put out a press release we're
gonna change our version of events and
they admit that their forces had killed
that NATO forces had
killed these pregnant women and that the
men were not Taliban commanders so the
family told me and told Jerome Starkey
the same thing which is that they got a
call and and a person they believed was
General Stanley McChrystal was going to
be coming to visit them and at the time
a crystal was the commander of all US
and NATO forces in Afghanistan and they
actually were plotting they wanted to
kill general McChrystal they wanted to
stab him to death when he came into
their home and one and one of the one of
the men told me that when when they did
this to my family I wanted to put on a
suicide vest and blow myself up among
the Americans remember these were us had
lies and now they're saying I want a
suicide vest and I want to kill general
McChrystal who was the leader of the war
and an imam at their local mosque said
no you're not to do that you're to give
him hospitality like our people do and
you welcomed him into your home and hear
what he has to say so they thought that
general McChrystal was coming to see
them they called Jerome Starkey Starkey
goes down there with his photographer
Jeremy Kelly and they're waiting with
the family thinking that McChrystal is
going to show up and up pulls this
convoy of vehicles with countless Afghan
military officials and some Americans
interspersed with them and they're in
the center of this crowd is a guy with a
name tag that says McRaven on it and and
has three stars on the lapel and and
they've brought with them two sheep and
and and they approached the compound in
the very place where the women had been
killed and and this command police
commander had been killed and they
offload these sheep and they put a knife
up to the sheep's neck and they're gonna
sacrifice the sheep and that what they
were doing was it was a ritual from
these people's culture the people who
were the victims of this and they were
it was like a forgiveness ritual so
they're coming Admiral McRaven shows up
with some sheep after this family had
been gunned down and then they and they
had blamed it on the family and then
said that was Taliban and that so that
this scene is unfolding this
photographer Jeremy Kelly starts taking
pictures of he didn't know who he was at
the time of Admiral McRaven and at the
time Admiral McRaven was the commander
of the most elite secretive US military
force and and he shows up with a sheep
in guard guard
Afghanistan and they're offering to
sacrifice it and the American and Afghan
forces try to stop the photographer they
try to hit the camera away
they say that Starkey and and and and
Jeremy Kelly are not allowed in but the
family and it was so smart of them the
family said no we we want him here as a
witness so that someone independent he's
here to know what you what goes on today
and so they have photos and Starkey took
in shorthand all the notes of what
McRaven said in the room that day and
McRaven admitted to the head of this
household that it was his forces that
had killed these pregnant women and and
and the Afghan police commander and he
apologized and then there were all these
stories that went out on ABC News and
others that the head of the household
had a pad accepted the apology when I
spoke to him he said I don't expect
expect accept their apology at all
he said the special forces did cruel
things to us they beat us they ruined
our life they wiped out our economy in
our in our compound by taking away all
of these people and they killed our
pregnant women I wouldn't trade my two
sons for the entire kingdom of the
United States is what he said and
another man chimed in and he said these
are these commandos with beards we call
them the American Taliban and and this
is an anti Taliban family and and and
and so you know when I watched the bin
Laden raid coverage and people started
saying JSOC publicly and we were showed
you know that the dog was named Cairo
and was a bell in la French Belgian
Malinois or whatever and then they we
know what guns were used and you know
Rick and I talk about this all the time
we know every detail that was leaked and
of course a lot of it turned out to be
not true but that's for a different
story I was thinking
where was the coverage of like
wall-to-wall coverage of this operation
that they did because that would give us
a little bit more of a balanced picture
of what happens in the thousands of
night raids that happen every year in
Afghanistan or in Pakistan or in
countries that were not even aware we're
raiding right now and and so that that
story for me really resonated strongly
because I think we only have a tiny
fraction of understanding the extent of
the kinds of operations that are being
done on a daily basis around the world
and we often hear about them when they
go the way that those in power want or
when the version that they want
publicized is the one accepted by
powerful media outlets Nome if you could
respond to what Jeremy said and also you
have written extensively about the
killing of Osama bin Laden and I was
wondering if you could comment on that
that I've written plenty of unpopular
articles and one of the most unpopular
had to do with the murder not killing of
Osama bin Laden Osama bin Laden was a
suspect there are principals believe it
or not that are not only in the
Constitution but go back to eight
hundred years to Magna Carta the
foundations of anglo-american law that's
they put it in narrow terms but the
general principle including Jeremy's
quite correct expansion of it to people
other than our own citizens is that a
person can't be punished by the state
without due process of law and a speedy
trial by his peers that's reasonable
principle it's in the Constitution it
was narrow if you look so in the
Constitution it didn't look naturally
didn't apply to Native Americans that
didn't apply to blacks dubiously applied
to women who at the time were considered
property not people about over the years
that's been expanded and unless it gets
to the point where the jeremy was
talking about where it's just human
beings we can't call ourselves a
civilized society and he made those are
the principles Osama bin Laden was a
suspect in fact eight personally I don't
have any doubt that he was responsible
but my personal opinion is nothing that
stands up in a court of law you have to
have evidence you have to a trial a
serious trial and it was pretty clear
that the u.s. government didn't want
that he was captured apprehended by you
know the most skilled masters of war to
use the Somali warlords
expression that exists in the world
eighty of them I think he was
defenseless the first story that came
out was that they had to shoot him
because his wife lunged at the seals and
what could they do
had to kill everybody but that story was
later withdrawn there was nothing he was
just a pretend a defenseless murdered
body thrown into the ocean leaving
obvious questions as to why and the the
dangers of this opera a lot of the
aspects of this operation so it was a
criminal but my they just total complete
criminal act no justification but
there's more to it than this
and I was kind of reminded of it when
Jeremy talked about the the Yemeni
testimony at the Senate those who might
have looked at the little tiny report on
that hidden the New York Times he said
something else this man who testified he
said that for years the al-qaeda the
slimmest radicals al Qaeda they called
them had been trying to turn the people
of this village against the Americans
and they didn't succeed but you've
succeeded with one drone strike you're
creating more people to kill you as you
pointed out and the same is true of the
Osama bin Laden assassination it first
of all they said the action itself was
extremely hazardous the Navy SEALs were
sent in were under orders to shoot their
way out if they got into any trouble
well if they'd started the pakistani
army is a professional army or committed
committed to the defense of the country
the sovereignty the country if they had
been caught there and tried to shoo
there what shoot their way out they
wouldn't have been left alone the
American forces next door
would have come in and you know massive
force and you know we might have been
involved in the nuclear war I mean it
was quite possible that was part of the
threat but there was something else that
happened actually been reported recently
I think in Scientific American but it
was known I mean the the way that they
identified bin Laden was through a
fraudulent vaccination vaccination
campaign they had doctors posing to do
anti polio vaccination in a in a poor
area of this town well they pretty soon
figured out it's not the poor areas the
rich area so they stopped the program in
the middle which is criminal in itself
actually running the program was
criminal using a vaccinated vaccination
program and doctors to try to apprehend
a suspect I mean that violates
principles going back to the Hippocratic
oath but then they stopped it in the
middle because they thought they were in
the wrong area were crimes then they
finally identified and but one
consequence of their actions was to
there is always in these societies
serious concern about what outsiders
Americans are up to when they come in
and start you know sticking needles and
people and so on that's always there
takes a lot of work to overcome that
hostility and it was being overcome
intact in Pakistan it now it's gone
they will not permit people to come in
carrying out vaccinations that polio is
almost gone in the world
Pakistan's one of the last places where
it survives okay
we're encouraging the spread of polio
and as one commentator pointed out back
to the Yemeni
in the Senate one of these days people
are gonna look at this crippled child
and say you did it to us and you can
guess what's gonna happen that if you
missed that testimony in the Senate and
the first-ever Senate drone hearings of
this young yemeni activists and
freelance journalists you can go to
democracynow.org because last wednesday
we played it in full and you can watch
him and also read the transcript but no
I wanted to ask you to follow up on
Jeremy's opening point around the
killing and closing point to the killing
of Americans versus people anywhere well
I Jamie's point is exactly right
and I think the murder of our Lackey and
we should be honest about it was you
took a look at the New York Times the
next day there was a headline which said
something like the West West celebrates
death of radical cleric you know good we
murdered a radical Claire then concerns
began to mount over the fact that he was
an American yeah bit of a problem should
be gone killing Americans and that's
pretty scandalous so just to reiterate
what Jeremy said doesn't matter whether
there are Americans or whatever they are
they're people going back to Magna Carta
the concept of people free of these
should be free of state terror has been
expanded over the years substantially
and it should be expanded to include
people they should be for if say terror
and I should say that I myself am kind
of hesitant about some of the things
might I do myself right now I'm a
plaintiff in a suit on be against the
NDAA
the NDAA proposals Obama's latest
National Defense Authorization Act
included includes provisions which make
it which optional for the government if
it chooses to place American citizens
under indefinite detention in military
prisons who's that again back to Magna
Carta much worse and if Chris Hedges
organized the suit to try to oppose this
and I signed on
but with reservations because what
difference does it make if they're
American citizens I mean the same NDAA
act authorized in fact makes it
mandatory in some circumstances for the
government to place non American
citizens under indefinite preventive
detention should be that's what we
should be that's what we should be
concerned with this suit incidentally
has taken an interesting course Obama
originally had said that he was opposed
to those provisions in the Act but he
would sign them then when the case went
to court at the lower court level the
the government that case the plaintiffs
won the judge threw out the government
prosecution on the group because the
press the prosecution refused to answer
a simple question will these plaintiffs
be subject to administer attention could
they be in they refused to answer that
so that judge threw that out Obama
immediately took it to the higher court
that shows you how much opposed these to
it it'll work its way to the Supreme
Court and given the Supreme Court the
government will probably win well
these are things we should really be
concerned about it's not if you want to
know what I'm sure you won't know but if
you really want to know in detail what
happens to non-citizens read some of the
testimonies so for example is a recent
book that came out by an Australian
David David Hill I think his name is
very much worth reading he's a young man
who was hiking around somewhere in
northern Afghanistan he was picked David
Hicks yeah he was picked up by the by
the Northern Alliance the US allies they
sold him for bounty to the American
forces and then he describes his years
in Bagram and then in Guantanamo seven
years the torture the sadism the cruelty
are just indescribable these are
American soldiers
you know they lead American soldiers you
just really have to read that too I mean
if anybody knows American history won't
surprise you that much but it's right in
front of our eyes
he said something quite interesting in
his testimony which I'm struck by he he
says the soldiers of course these guys
were shackled bound you know couldn't
move surrounded by all kinds of military
police and so on but he said the guards
were afraid of the prisoners he said the
guards had been so brainwashed by
whatever training they went through that
they thought these prisoners were
superhuman
they said the guards would come to his
cell sometimes where he's shackled you
know so on and ask him to perform some
of his feats like you know climb on the
ceilings we show as I do it
this kind of thing and in fact when they
took them out to be interrogated and
they have a look up for tune of Marines
around them to make sure that they
didn't carry out some incredibly
monstrous act that these soldiers have
probably seen in a video movie somewhere
and they but he said they really were
terrified of the prisoners and that
tells us something else about our own
society that what are we doing to our
own society when we're creating such a
terror and fear among ordinary people I
mean it's it's kind of like having guns
and you know armed armed policemen in
schools is that what you want your
children to see that we live in a
society where you have to have people
with guns around to protect you from
some unimaginable danger and here was
another serious as far as American
culture is concerned something very much
should be concerned about this is a very
frightened society always has been goes
back to colonial times is very striking
today it is taking a remarkable for if
you look at the you know the gun culture
the people who are pressing for having
guns are terrified a lot of them are
simply terrified they're like these
guards standing outside the prison
what are they terrified of you gotta
have guns to protect ourselves from who
the federal government the United
Nations oh yeah so whoever maybe we
don't know what horrible force is coming
after us but we have to have guns to
protect ourselves put aside the fact
that guns would be any good and they'll
probably kill each other but the fear
throughout the society is simply
incredible Jeremy just like a couple of
things in in in response that I was
remembering when you were talking about
David Hicks story this this case that I
came across
in in Yemen of a journalist named
Abdulelah Haider Shia when the when when
President Obama first authorized the
bombing of Yemen was in December of 2009
the first strike that we know of
authorized under the Obama
administration was on December 17 2009
and Yemen there hadn't been a bombing a
u.s. bombing there that we know of since
November of 2002 the first drone strike
actually that that was conducted outside
of Afghanistan was in Yemen in 2002 and
it killed a number of people including a
US citizen named Kamal Darwish and and
he actually was not was not supposedly
the target of that strike but they
claimed that he had ties to a terror
cell called the Lackawanna six which
like many of the plots we've seen lately
seemed to have been the in large part
the FBI breaking up its own plot and
which is really scandalous if you look
at how many times this has happened and
all these cases of entrapment but
President Obama starts decides to start
bombing Yemen in December of 2009 they
do this strike on what they are told by
the Yemeni government and by US
intelligence is an al Qaeda training
camp and that there is this notorious al
Qaeda figure who's known to be in the
camp well it turned out that this guy
when we investigated it and went to
Yemen and spoke to people that knew him
and knew the infrastructure of AQAP that
he was an old jihadist who had fought in
the Mujahideen war in Afghanistan and
and and had a very peripheral connection
to al Qaeda so it seems like what
happened is that the you know the US
outsource is a lot of its intelligence
gathering in Yemen to notoriously
corrupt Yemeni officials and agencies
and and to the Saudis and the Saudis
have their own war that they're waging
inside of Yemen the US stick back
dictatorship of Ali Abdullah Saleh was
playing multiple sides playing the
Saudis playing the u.s. playing various
tribes inside the country there were
several occasions when Saleh fed the US
intelligence saying someone was Al Qaeda
and it turned out to be at a political
opponent of the regime that was being
killed or assassinated by the US on
behalf and the service of the
dictator of Yemen and so in this case in
December 17 2009 they they bombed this
village supposedly to kill this one guy
who does not seem to have been anything
he'd been vaguely resembling a senior
al-qaeda figure in the country and and
and after the the missile strike happens
the Yemeni government puts out a press
release taking credit for the strike
saying it had conducted these airstrikes
and the Obama administration
congratulated the Yemeni government on
taking the fight to the terrorists in
Yemen a number of tribal leaders in
Yemen got phone calls from this small
poor Bedouin village called el Missoula
that this missiles had slammed into the
area and had shredded people into meat
and these tribal leaders went there and
also a young this young journalist
Abdulelah Haider Shia who had done
reporting and worked for The Washington
Post for ABC News for al-jazeera he was
a very very well-known journalist in
Yemen and and he was known because he
was a brave guy who would go and
actually interview al Qaeda figures much
of what the United States knows about
certain leaders in al-qaeda come from
the root comes from the reporting of
Abdulelah Haider Shia he if you could
look at it one way and say it was he was
a very valuable guy to have out talking
to these people because it helped the US
intelligence officials understand or
operatives understand who it was they
were supposedly trying to kill and but
that's that's for a different story so
this guy goes to these tribal leaders go
there and they they take photographs of
the missile parts and they then share it
show them broadcast them on al-jazeera
and other outlets and share them with
Amnesty International and Amnesty
International has a weapons expert come
in and analyzed them and they determined
that they were that there was a cruise
missile attack and and and when when
Rick and I were in a beyon province we
had the parts filmed they're still there
in the desert by the way you can go if
you want to try to go to al module you
can go there and they're still in the
middle of the desert
with General Dynamics and made in the
USA right there visible and we show this
in our film we show the the aftermath of
this bombing and and the missile parts
that were still there you know at well
after the bombs and drop but the u.s.
also but the the other weapon bombs that
they found there were
cluster bombs which of course are banned
under under international conventions
and the cluster bombs are basically I
saw the effect of them when the US was
using them in the Kosovo war in 1999 I
went to the niche market place after it
was bombed in Serbia and saw the
aftermath of it there like flying land
mines and they shred everything in its
path into into meat and limbs and it is
horrifying to see the aftermath of any
bombing but cluster bombs are a
particularly brutal weapon and there are
unexploded cluster bombs that were left
there and after the bombing had taken
place some children were playing near a
cluster bomb and picked one of them up
and it blew them to pieces two days
after the bomb bombing had happened so
they take these pictures they send them
to Amnesty International and these
shaykhs
tribal sheiks organized a gathering to
say that this is not the Yemeni
government that did this because Yemen
doesn't have these missiles amnesty does
an analysis of them and determines that
they were in fact u.s. weapons and that
only the United States could have been
responsible for that bombing and so this
sort of scandal was brewing inside of
Yemen because the people who were killed
there there were at least 46 people
killed 14 of the people killed were
women and 21 were children when the
Yemeni Parliament which is is a which is
supported by the United States went to
investigate it they listed all of the
dead their ages their names their
genders and I got a copy of that report
and and have the list of every single
person that we know of that was killed
in that strike and we added it up and it
was 14 women and 21 children among the
46 dead and in the pursuit of trying to
kill this one person who the President
of the United States had been told was
this high-value target who everyone in
Yemen says was a an older Mujahideen who
had primarily done his jihad in
Afghanistan and not inside of Yemen when
this started to become public
this Yemeni journalist was going on
al-jazeera and was helping other US
media outlets report that story that it
was in fact the US strike US officials
were denying it and eventually that
anonymously said yes we were behind the
strike but General David Petraeus said
that no civilians were actually killed
in the strike and that it's all a big
exaggeration which was very offensive to
Yemenis of all political stripes and so
it was an enduring
scandal and this one journalist was
really pushing this story and he
continued to report on other on the
expanding US air war in Yemen and one
night in the middle of the night he was
he in the middle of day he was out with
a friend of his it was a political
cartoonist and they were shopping and he
was snatched by US backed us trained
counterterrorism forces in sana the
capital of Yemen and was taken to the
political security prison and was beaten
bloody by the security services and told
that he was to stop talking about the
missile strikes and then they released
him onto the streets and what this
journalist did was to go straight to
al-jazeera and say I was just beaten by
the political security officers and
they're trying to stop me from talking
about the u.s. missile strikes that are
happening in the country and and soon
after he did that his house was raided
by the the CTU the counterterrorism unit
which is a JSOC and CIA trained entity
and they snatched him out of his home
and disappeared him for 30 days and no
one knew where he was and then they
hauled him into a court that it's been
specifically set up by the dictatorship
to prosecute journalists for crimes
against the state and and was ultimately
convicted of being a an al Qaeda
facilitator because he facilitated al
Qaeda members being able to speak to the
media and and which I've talked to
people in US intelligence who actually
also believe that this case is
outrageous because they said you took
off the streets one of the best
reporters that we would read who so we
could actually understand what was going
on in Yemen because of the notorious
corruption of all of the informants so
he is put into this prison he's put on
trial total sham trial
his lawyers refused to present a defense
no lawyer would represent him at his own
request because he said I don't want to
recognize a shred of legitimacy of this
process and we have video of him when he
is in prison they bring him in front of
the in into the courtroom in US in a
Cell they have him in a cage in the cell
and as they're pulling him away he said
my crime is exposing the American
missile attack on the tiny Bedouin
village of al moduli and Abhiyan
province they're putting me in jail
because I exposed their cruise missile
attack
and they said this is what happens when
you when yemeni journalists are real
journalists and they pull him away and
they and they disappear him into this
prison there was so much outrage in
yemen from his tribe and from from human
rights organizations and from mainstream
civil society in yemen that the dictator
ali abdullah saleh had no choice but to
issue a pardon against Abdulelah Haider
Shia this happens a lot in Yemen someone
gets arrested the tribes protest and
then the person is released it's a whole
it's a game that's been playing out in
that country for a long time so he's
going to issue a pardon in the official
news service the Sabah News Agency does
a report saying that that this
journalist is going to be pardoned that
day the dictator of Yemen receives a
phone call from the White House not from
some liaison not from Secretary of State
from President Obama himself personally
and President Obama tells the dictator
of Yemen that he's deeply concerned
about news that Abdulelah Haider Shia is
going to be released and the pardon is
torn up unless you think I'm making this
up where I've just heard it secondhand I
know this because the White House put it
on their own website in a readout of the
phone call from that day and when I
called the State Department to ask them
this is a year and a half after a blow
Haider had been in prison since this
phone call what is the US State
Department's position on Abdulelah
Haider Shia they said our position
remains the same as articulated by
President Obama in that phone call we
believe he should be kept in prison so
this journalist is in prison because of
the President of the United States
making a phone call and having his
pardon ripped up and he's not doing well
in prison I'm in touch with his family
he's my understanding is that he's
losing he's starting to lose his mind
which is very common with people that
are kept in solitary confinement or in
these conditions and and and none of the
news organizations that worked with him
in the u.s. ABC News Washington Post and
none of them have said anything about
his case not where are they when he's
getting them sensationalist footage when
it when he interviewed Anwar Awlaki they
all wanted to broadcast his comments
about Nidal Hasan you know who conducted
the massacre at Fort Hood Texas and they
wanted to ask
they want to know what how Lockheed said
about the underwear bomber you know why
we know what our Lockheed thought about
that because Abdulelah Haider Shia found
him interviewed him and published it in
the Washington Post on NBC and yet when
he's in prison
they say nothing it's shameful it's
shameful and and that's often what
happens in these cases journalists
journalists like like myself and others
we go into these countries and and and
you know I encourage people to read the
acknowledgments in my book because I
tell you I'm the names of all of the
journalists in Yemen and Somalia and
Afghanistan and elsewhere around the
world
who made it possible for this story to
be told and they're the real heroes of
this unfamous journalists who report
oftentimes not in English take the great
risks people like me I go in and I can
go somewhere for a few weeks or a month
and I depend on them to be able to tell
these stories and and when so when
something happens to one of our
colleagues Somalia journalists are being
gunned down in record numbers in Yemen
journalists are being thrown in prison
who if we don't speak up when we have a
platform and and defend our colleagues
we should be ashamed of ourselves and we
should be ashamed to call ourselves
journalists
no as we wrap up this is the week that
the bush library is being opened in
Dallas where there is an evaluation a
reevaluation going on of his record it's
the 10th anniversary of the war in Iraq
and today we're talking about the years
of the Obama administration can you talk
about President Obama's record I tell
you what I felt and maybe some of the
rest of you felt when I saw the pictures
of the Bush library presentation there
was a group of men standing there former
presidents ones are alive every one of
them is a major criminal a major
Obama is continuing the grand tradition
should be his great surprise and I guess
the the sentence that came to my mind at
the time is actually from Thomas
Jefferson who said once that he said I
tremble for my country when I think that
God is just and some day will bring us
to his judgment well if we can't bring
them to some kind of judgment either if
not the courts at least in public
opinion then it's kind of like what
Jeremy said we're not doing our our duty
just as responsible people
Jeremy we're gonna end with you this is
your second major book your first book
was Blackwater the rise of the world's
most powerful mercenary army where you
really reframed you reframed the whole
discussion about mercenaries and the
privatization of the US military suffice
it to say here we are what six years
later and Eric Prince had to move the
founder of Blackwater to Abu Dhabi and
you remain here in the United States
less and I wanted to ask with this
second book and Jeremy's going to be
signing afterwards and I encourage
everyone to get this book not just for
interesting summer reading but that we
can see a spring in a summer of US
foreign policy when we are informed what
a difference it makes to begin with
those tools to be empowered to challenge
what we how we are represented in the
rest of the world but I want to ask you
Jeremy finally your new book it's called
dirty wars the world is a battlefield
what are you hoping to accomplish with
this book and why you even call it dirty
wars one one one thing that I think
you'll notice if you if you read the
book you know I I I've talked to friends
about the you know when I wrote
Blackwater I think I've grown up a lot
since I wrote that book in in a sense
because something really strange
happened to me after I wrote Blackwater
and that was that I started to get
emails and and other electronic
communications from from people that had
served in Special Operations Forces are
worked with the CIA not senior officials
I don't hobnob with the powerful
in fact when I was talking about this
official who told me what he said about
the killing of a blue rock man I had to
chase him around the campus of a
university I found him on and and you
know he did not want to speak to me I
had to sort of chase him that's that's
pretty much the only interaction I have
with powerful officials is chasing them
somewhere but uh but but I started to
get communications from operators and
people that were doing these operations
and you know there was a sort of a
pattern to them early on and sometimes
they would come to events and come up to
me afterwards and and they'd say you
know I don't a lot of ones I don't care
very much for your politics but you were
totally right about black water you
can't stand them and I got to know
people in that world in that community
because they also were had problems with
black water and didn't like various
actions or problems that the company's
actions had caused for their units or
the fact that they were getting paid so
much more than the conventional soldiers
whatever it was but I started a dialogue
with with some of these people that
continues to this day and I've learned a
tremendous about from them about how
these operations run and what I tried to
do in the book I mean I hope I succeeded
to a degree with it is to weave in and
out of stories that show the complicated
landscape of the killing fields and the
the men who do the operations on the
ground the figures who are identified as
the targets the civilians that are
forced to live on the other side of the
barrel of the gun or in the place where
the bombs are going off and to put it in
a historical context I think if you had
asked me years ago what I think you know
what I wanted to accomplish or what I
think should be done I would have
pretended to have an answer
because I think it's I was you know I
was bullheaded I I think that we
unfortunately are only at the very
beginning of a conversation that we have
to that's urgent and that we have to
have in this country about how far are
we as a society have let things to go
things go since 9/11 in the name of
protecting our security and I I concur
very much with what Noam said about
being gripped by fear you know fear is a
very powerful force and if you don't
figure out a way
to confront it and not be owned by it
then things like the Patriot Act happen
and and civil liberties get rolled back
and you know people say Oh NDAA the
people that are whining about that are
crazy and it's conspiracy theory and all
of these things and you just have just
study history it starts somewhere it
starts with an idea and then a crisis
happens and they implement the idea
that's been laying around it's a you
know it's it's it's a it's a very
age-old concept and my hope is that
people use the book as actionable
intelligence which is actually an Intel
you know a term and that's in the CIA or
in the targeting business but I want it
to be actionable intelligence to work
toward a democratic process of
confronting our own fear and also
holding those in power accountable
whether they're Democrats or Republicans
I think all of us should be defined not
by the public pronouncements of
politicians but by what we do in
response to the actions they're doing in
our name and that's the spirit I wrote
this book
