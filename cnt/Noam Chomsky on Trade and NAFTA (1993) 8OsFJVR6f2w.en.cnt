noam chomsky professor of linguistics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology this evening in Washington
speaking to a group they've asked you to
come talk about the implications and
consequences of the Clinton
administration's foreign policy
how's Bill Clinton done first year in
foreign policy I think about as expected
I actually wrote an article last
December about it my view is that he was
exactly the way he presented himself
candidate of big business new democrat
free from the old liberal cliche is
about entitlements and rights and so on
committed to improving the business
climate to engaging the government more
in supporting the wealthy the kind of
thing he'd done in Arkansas and I think
that the both the formulation of the
policy which came in late September
there was a series of speeches in which
the Clinton vision as they were calling
it was formulated and then the
achievements of the policy which are
essentially the November achievements
NAFTA the the Asian Pacific Council
summit associated domestic programs that
reflects his achievement in supporting
the concerns and interests of major
American corporations it explains why
the Wall Street Journal for example is
so enthusiastic about him describing him
as a continuing with what has been a
pattern of Democratic presidents who
linked up very closely to interests of
big business rather than a small
business whereas the Republicans in
contrast tend to be the party of the
business community generally so somewhat
different and I think that's pretty much
what we're finding and we will continue
to find I think with the health plan and
so on
on the other hand and other foreign
policy issues such as you know I'm say
helping restore democracy in Haiti and
so on I mean I never expected any
possibility that and don't see any if if
you mentioned some of those the foreign
policy achievements go back and talk a
little bit more detail you mentioned
NAFTA
off to bat now going to that little
further about the impact NAFTA is going
to have well and after there's a good
deal of the issue that was discussed
like will there be more jobs or less
jobs the nobody has any idea under the
economic models that are being used
they're so remote from reality that what
they say is almost meaningless and
that's pointed out a long time ago the
Congressional office of Technology
Assessment did an analysis of this
executive version of NAFTA about a year
ago and made that point on others
however there are some consequences
about which there's pretty general
agreement then if you read the text and
you see the international forces at work
you can understand why it is going to
have the effect of deepening the split
between the the wealthy and the general
population inequality has been growing
in the country for about 30 years real
wages have been declining growth has
been quite slow such wealth has been
created is going increasingly through a
small sector of the wealthy the country
is kind of taking on a sort of a third
world look I mean it's not Brazil or
Mexico but if you walk through the
streets of any major city say Washington
or New York or whatever you see what the
statistics tell you that there's a large
relatively marginalized population
developing superfluous for wealth
production because increasingly
transnational corporations are able to
shift production to high repression in
low-wage areas elsewhere and wages will
go down in fact they're going down
internationally because these things all
interact so as American we u.s. wages
are now the lowest in the industrial
world outside of Britain that's a big
change over the last ten years in fact a
complete reversal and that means that a
German factories will invest in Alabama
as they're now doing because they get
much cheaper and more repressed labor so
it brings down German wages the so what
is it anticipated from NAFTA I think
almost across the board is a lowering of
the income of a substantial part of the
population probably a majority an
increase in wealth for privileged
sectors and what that will mean overall
in the statistics is not so certain so
let me give you one one analysis which
is highly regarded and taken actually
here in Washington Post is by a UCLA
professor of management Edward leemer
who's prone asked I believe and he
estimated that by the end of the decade
if NAFTA goes through in the present
form the form that it didn't go through
there would be an increase his estimate
was of about three thousand dollars a
year in income for professionals and
ASEC people associated with the higher
levels of the business community
managerial skilled labor executives and
so on about three thousand dollars a
year
increase in income for them about a
seven hundred and fifty dollar a year
decline in income for most of the
workforce and he figured that would
average out to about a two hundred
dollar a year decline for the general
population and my believe he's Pro NAFTA
and most of the economists were prone
enough to say something similar so my
colleague Paul Krugman of MIT is a
international trade specialist who was
very Pro NAFTA does agree that for
unskilled labor there will be a decline
in income unskilled labor happens to be
70 percent of the workforce there was an
analysis in New York Times the day after
the NAFTA vote they delayed it it's a
first analysis of the regional impact of
NAFTA predicted regional impact in the
New York area and it was exactly the
same they said banking corporate law
firms pharmaceutical corporations of the
publishing industry chemical industry
which is highly capital intensive not
many workers corporate law firms and
they'll all do fine then they said
there'll be some losers the losers will
be women blacks Hispanics semi skilled
labor that's about three-quarters of the
workforce and the effect will be to
split to increase intensify the move
that is very clear to our
separating the society into two tiers in
the long term it means sort of
internationalizing the third world model
that's the typical third world country
say Mexico you know small sector of very
wealthy people usually connected to
international investment and finance and
transnationals and so on and a very
large sector of extremely poor people
and that instantly NAFTA is expected to
have the same effect in Mexico so the
leading Mexican financial journal which
is very Pro NAFTA estimated that about
25 percent of Mexican manufacturing
industry would be destroyed in the first
two years and about fourteen percent of
the workforce would be eliminated
another effect of NAFTA which everyone
expects is that the cheap US
agribusiness exports will contribute to
the process already going on of driving
out large numbers of peasant producers
all of this swells the workforce
swelling the workforce drives now an
income there is no serious opportunity
for organizing it's pretty repressive
and brutal so that will have the effect
of lowering wages there and just this
will have the effect of lowering wages
here and this if you look at the
international system this is a
continuing drag you know any country
that's providing more where workers have
achieved more right say rights to hold
job security or pension rights or
whatever it's naturally going to be
driven down as international capital can
seek the point of highest repression and
lowest wages so where you move towards
an international economy of essentially
low growth low wages and very high
profits and that's a kind of
internationalization of the third world
model and this particular version of
NAFTA was is very likely to have that
consequence no you know it should not be
called a free trade agreement because it
is not it is a highly protectionist
agreement with a complex mixture of
liberalisation and protection designed
to guarantee investor right investor
rights are very delicately protected
worker rights community rights and so on
undercut in fact one consequence of it
is to attack democratic institutions as
aims to get it places decision-making
power in the hands of unaccountable
structures which are transnational if
there's a conflict let's say between
some local or regional decision on say
environmental protection or pesticides
or whatever and in a transnational
corporation that will ultimately find
its way to an adjudication panel which
operates in secret which is made up
mainly of corporate lawyers and so on
and is out of public control all of
these systems reduce the role and
effectiveness of parliamentary
institutions and unions and other
popular groups and increase the
decision-making power of investors and
transnational corporations and big banks
and so on and that's what they're
intended to do good afternoon and
welcome to a special LIVE viewer callin
program on this Friday afternoon our
guest for about the next 35 minutes now
Noam Chomsky professor of linguistics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology we've seen the numbers at the
bottom of the screen and we ask if
you've called in the past 30 days to
await so that others can get in with our
calls a little bit more easily first
call us from Royal Oak Michigan good
afternoon
you know you started talking about NAFTA
and you got me thinking about my my
first objection to it was just the fact
that it was like 2,000 pages and you
know it's just it's like you don't you
don't really understand it and you think
they're trying to fool you with
something and I was wondering how long
did bills used to be like a hundred
years ago and do you think that you know
it would be possible for them ever to
just see all future bills should be less
than ten times the length of the US
Constitution well you're quite right
about the not only the length of this
but if you do have a look at it you'll
find out it's also unreadable I mean
it's it's very hard going and recall
that this was it was intended that this
would be rammed through in secret if you
look at what happened
the agreement was signed by the three
executives of Canada United States and
Mexico
in mid-august 1992 I think was August
12th or so in 1992 remember that was
right in the middle of a presidential
campaign whatever one thinks of attitude
towards NAFTA Chavez has a big effect on
American life try to look back and find
out what anybody said about it nobody
was very little discussed in fact
probably wouldn't been mentioned at all
if Perot hadn't brought it up nobody
knew about it nobody knew what was going
on according to US trade law there's a
1974 congressional legislation which
requires that any trade related
instrument any law or whatever involving
trade must be submitted to the labor
advisory committee group-based and
unions as for advice and consultation
and analysis that's the one popular
input to trade legislation it was not
given to them they were in fact informed
that their reaction to NAFTA was due on
you know I would say September 15th or
whatever the date was some date around
then and they were actually given the
text of this 2,000 page document on
readable document 24 hours before the
due date that was to ensure that they
couldn't even formally convene all of
this incidentally was suppressed in the
press nobody talked about it the labor
advisory committee did write a very
detailed and rather interesting analysis
and they were very bitter about this and
pointed out that even the procedure was
a major attack on democracy the
intention was that all this would go
through Congress was on a fast track
they weren't gonna pay any attention to
it and nobody would know there was
enough popular opposition that developed
for all sorts of reasons so that it had
to become a public issue but it was not
intended to be it was intended to be you
can see by just what I described it was
intended to be driven home and secret
and then just sort of sitting there
locking into place particular
arrangements and particulars of the
powerful and as I mentioned it itself is
quite anti-democratic in its essential
nature so your reaction to the length of
the text and
and for the more the complexity the text
is quite accurate when we fill out more
details we see that that's a large part
of it in fact I think it should men eat
the major impact of these of these
developments including yet may well be
to undermine democratic structures and
to transfer power to private private
power essentially private transnational
institutions and recall that a
corporation is essentially free from
public control and when it becomes
transnational even the limited control
that comes from national legislation
declines you are professor of
linguistics
what is linguistics and what's the two
parts and what's the significance of its
study well there's a lot covers a lot of
territory but the kind of linguistics
that we do is an effort to find out the
basic principles of a certain part of
human cognitive nature what is it that
enables us to to do what you and I are
doing what special thing is it about our
brains as distinct from other organisms
that enables these extremely complex
systems of Arctic of the creation and
articulation of thought and interaction
first of all to develop why do they have
the forms they do what are the
principles they operate under what
aspects of them are universal just
rooted in our genes basically which kind
of to be most of them and what does this
tell us about the nature of the human
mind and that's essentially the topic
Cherry Hill New Jersey good afternoon
gosh I wish would stop dissecting every
part of the United States in the world
why don't we go to a 25 hour a week work
and we could all go out and smell the
roses what's so bad about that
well actually proposals with that kind
were made by not for 25 hours but I
think 36 hours or something by the
union's years ago and that's a very it's
a very interesting question remember the
fight for a 40-hour week was a huge
battle it took almost well about 70 or
80 years of a very bitter strife and in
the night
States very violent strife I should say
I think about 700 workers were killed by
security forces during that period
simply to attain the 40-hour week and
shortly after that victory was attained
that started being lost so the 40-hour
week is now a thing of the past the
average work week has been increasing
through a variety of mechanisms since
that victory was won the question of
whether there should be a lower workweek
is it should be you know it in my
opinion at least I mean here our values
come in but in my opinion it should be
basically a matter of a necrotic
decision but of course for it to be a
matter of democratic decision that means
that corporate power has to be under
Democratic control if the decisions are
made by private power unaccountable
private power they are naturally going
to try to drive their workforce down to
the lowest possible level and get the
maximum out of them and if that comes
from having 60 hour weeks they'll drive
for that Garden Grove California good
afternoon
yes I wanted to ask mr. Chomsky if he
believes that if there are no changes
made and the way we trade and operate
internationally whether this wouldn't in
the long run reduce the world to global
serfdom and then it seems were right
back to where communism came in in the
first place if people cannot survive
they're going to repeal and here we
spent 40 or 50 years fighting communism
and we seem to be moving in to the
direction where we're going to get it
back thanks for the call
well there's a lot to say about what we
call fighting communism for one thing
there's no plausible sense of the word
in which the Soviet Union was communist
or socialist or anything like that it
was a totalitarian state which was from
its origins radically opposed to any
element of the traditional socialist
vision but whatever it was this was a
big part of the traditional third world
which is essentially what Russia and a
spirit were with in Europe's third world
had been for hundreds of years which
went off on a course of independent
development which we call communism and
they
called communism that we don't allow
parts of the third world to escape from
their service rule it doesn't matter
whether they're little ones or big ones
and that led to a big conflict they are
now back in a third world that's what
losing the Cold War means and I don't
think it's a I mean the the
revolutionary changes that took place in
Russia were indeed a reaction to their
deeply impoverished third world
conditions they had nothing to do with
socialism or anything like that but
that's what they were you're right our
effort to destroy it was not an attempt
to to improve economic conditions in
fact take a look at the parts of the
third world that we do control that
takes a Brazil you know huge rich
country with enormous resources which
we've been had a big strong hand and
running since 1945 and take a look at it
that's what we've been trying to create
in a third world it's a country with a
sector and five or ten percent of the
population of great wealth the average
level of the country is about at the
level of Albania or Paraguay then maybe
75 percent of the population lives in
utter misery and this is in a country
with an enormous advantages no enemies
tremendous resources of lotta US aid and
in fact US tutelage since 1945 and my
suspicion is that's what much of Eastern
Europe will come to look like but you're
right about the the tendencies that now
exist are polar or polarizing tendencies
much of the world indeed most of the
world is the society is becoming
polarized on an international scale with
these there's low growth in most places
there's increasing wealth but in very
small sectors and substantial parts of
the population are declining they have
to be controlled by force in my opinion
it's kind of symbolic that the
anti-crime bill passed a couple of days
after NAFTA passed
I mean after NAFTA it's going to have I
think it's fairly clear this polarizing
effect meaning more people more social
disintegration meaning more crime
meaning more force because unless
something constructive is done to
reconstruct society you just gonna
control people by force and will it
ultimately lead to rebellion or I think
it probably will I mean in South Central
Los Angeles is a case I wouldn't call it
a rebellion it's a break out of some
kind but it's a response to and these
are @xa South Central Los Angeles I mean
these are regions where there were jobs
at one point there was industry when
that disappears you get social
disintegration which can take all kind
of forms I mean abuse and families for
example alcoholism random violence I
mean take a lot of forms it could
possibly take constructive forms and I
very much hope it will and those
constructive forms all of the efforts to
reverse these tendencies which are
deeply rooted in the international
economy Lagrange Indiana good afternoon
yes dr. Chomsky I'm a student at Purdue
University and I would just like you to
know that you've been an inspiration to
me academically my question is how would
you like to see President Clinton
respond to the growing nuclear threat of
North Korea I would like to see serious
efforts against proliferation and
looking at North Korea alone does not
really respond to that issue first of
all the question of North Korea and is
in a broader context but bear in mind
that while Clinton is talking about nuke
the threat of nuclear proliferation in
North Korea he's also contributing to
nuclear proliferation so one of his
grand achievements at the asia-pacific
summit was to override congressional
restrictions on sale of high technology
equipment to China now those
restrictions were imposed by Congress
when Congress was given what they
considered conclusive evidence that
China was involved in missile
proliferation possibly involving North
Korea incidentally and possibly also
nuclear proliferation and if you look at
Clinton's summit decision it was to give
them supercomputers which is Pentagon
analysts quickly pointed out can be used
for missile development and nuclear
development and also to allow US exports
for nuclear power generation now nuclear
power
nuclear weapons production are very
close and since China has we can believe
us intelligent have been engaged in
proliferation essentially Nixon was a
Clinton was saying that I don't care
about proliferation what I care about is
profit for US corporations there are
other cases too I mean one of the major
nuclear powers aside from the really big
ones is the State of Israel which is the
CIA pointed out decades ago has hundreds
of nuclear weapons well you know it's
nuclear capacity is as an element in in
the world which has a lot of people
frightened I don't see any concern about
that when you turn to North Korea I
think the problem is real and I think
it's a problem of how North Korea is to
be integrated into a world system in in
under conditions in which it is at the
moment pretty desperate and pretty
unstable and that issue goes beyond
nuclear weapons it looks to me as though
North Korea is kind of desperately
trying to trade some form of potential
or maybe actual nuclear weapons
development against a form of acceptance
into the international system and I
think that's the direction that should
be pursued the last call was say a
student what kind of a teaching load do
you still carry regular teaching load at
a place like I teach my graduate school
so it means well I don't know maybe
several hours a week of actual and
lecturing and many hours a week of
person-to-person interaction with
students Plus and you've been teaching
for how many years
oh geez thirty-eight years I guess all
the words named after nearly 40 years
what do you still like about the
classroom oh it's really exciting I mean
the there's nothing more exciting than
the intellectual interchange and the
interaction with students whether it's
in chill I at one time in my life
actually taught children not teaching
advanced graduate students and it's
always an exciting experience or it can
be McLean Virginia good afternoon
good afternoon dr. Chomsky two questions
number one have you written another book
since deterring democracy or do you have
another one in the works yeah several oh
great three or four in fact I'm a little
bit on them they're kind of hard to find
you know and yeah though well let me see
if I can remember them I'll list them
for you really fast year 501 rethinking
Camelot chronicles with dissent letters
from Lexington and prosperous few and
the Restless many or what come to mind
great great color you said they're
they're hard to find
well they're usually not on the Shelf
per se or you have to special order them
in terms of being able to get them I'd
you know I don't like to wait around for
things to come in I just like to see
what's on the shelf and they're not
there a little bit on the scare side
they're also not reviewed so it's hard
to know about them and they're usually
published by small presses which don't
have the resources to advertise okay one
other quick second question in terms of
looking at the mass media these days you
don't really see much contrary opinion
real contrary opinion when you're
looking at the major media and it's good
to see that at least you get out every
once in a while I caught you and Posner
and Donahue a while ago and what what do
you think in terms of getting more
dissent in terms of real contrary
opinion into the media do you think
that'll be happening or how does that
work I wouldn't think it it's not on its
own it won't happen I mean the media are
basically huge corporations which sell
audiences to advertisers and they're
gonna reflect the interest of their
owners and their buyers by and large
however as popular pressures develop you
know as popular organization takes place
and in it popular involvement in the
political system and in social change
and so on the medial respond to it I
think you're quite right that there's
more openings now than there were say 30
years ago at least I experienced that to
a limited extent and I think it's just a
result of the changes that have taken
place in the country
I mean it's a more active lively vibrant
society than it was thirty years ago and
this is reflected in the media to some
extent while you're but why are your
books are defined
they say unpopular things so the what
one book of mine happens to be on the US
media were the bestseller and can
it was literally a best-seller it was
based on lectures given over Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation I don't think
it has a single review in the United
States why should American media want to
publicize a critical analysis of the
American meeting San Francisco good
afternoon
yes hi professor Chomsky I want to let
you know that I was at the premiere of
your the documentary about you and
premiered here in San Francisco and I
thoroughly enjoyed it my question for
you is now that the historians are
starting to speak about the 80s and the
Ronald Reagan presidency I'm not so
interested in you know what you feel
about Ronald Reagan more what would you
feel the continued effects as we head
into the next century are going to be
and maybe speak to the conditions that
brought this about well
the Reagan I think you're right in
putting Reagan aside I don't think I
think he was mostly a symbolic figure
probably didn't even know what policy
was most of the time but the the
policies that developed in the in the
Reagan years were in fact continuations
of the late Carter years so if you look
at the last few years of the Carter
Administration Carter introduced called
for vast expansion of the military
budget and cutback of social programs
though he didn't have quite the
political clout to push that through
but the Reaganites pushed it through and
in fact the military programs of the
Reagan years are not all that different
from the projections of the Carter years
same with the cutback of social programs
and this goes back to things that
happened in the early 70s and when there
were big changes that took place in the
international system one of them was
that Richard Nixon dismantled the
Bretton Woods system the system of that
developed after the Second World War of
international sort of capital regulation
in which the US was in effect the World
Bank er that said that was one of a
number of factors that said in motion a
substantially in fact huge growth of
speculative capital in the world of
accelerated the internationalization of
production meaning
you know 15 of production abroad and
that sort of thing and set a lot of
other forces in motion this meant a
sharp attack it meant lower growth sharp
attack on welfare and living standards
and wages wages have been real wages in
the United States have been declining
since about that time in fact and the
Reagan years simply extended and
accelerated these differences so the
Reagan years were years of substantial
polarization maybe 70% of the population
it's actual absolute wealth declined in
the Reagan years whereas for the top few
percent they became greatly enriched and
this just is a continuation and indeed
acceleration of the kind of processes
we've been talking about and unless
there's there also going on in the
Clinton years and unless we the
population does something about them
they're going to continue Syracuse good
afternoon dr. Chomsky yeah I played Sam
long admire your work studied it here at
turkeys University I was wondering how
you feel
NAFTA will affect third world countries
particularly countries in Central
America spoke earlier on third world
economies well of course the Central
American countries technically aren't in
NAFTA but the and it's a little hard to
predict there was a what was called a
Caribbean Basin initiative which was
going to include the Central American
countries and the Caribbean countries
and that was that the policies of the
central of the Caribbean Basin
initiative were what are called
liberalization I mean those countries
are to open themselves up to market
forces now that has a general and NAFTA
will probably in the long term
contribute to opening up third world
countries to market forces now there are
a lot of rich countries don't allow
themselves to be open to market forces
so the United States is highly
protectionist it has all sorts of
systems for massive state intervention
in the economy and it always has every
successful developed country relied from
England up till you know South Korea and
Taiwan relied on including
us that relied on radical intervention
at a state intervention to protect
economic power from market forces and it
continues until this day the Pentagon
system for example economically speaking
is just a funnel of by which the general
public subsidizes high-tech industry
which is of course a radical violation
of market principles however the third
world's to be deprived of those
mechanisms so that it will in fact be a
kind of service area and the effect of
these programs there have now been
so-called structural adjustment programs
there have been over 75 and then I
forgotten how many exactly the general
effect that they have is to lower
Labor's share of national income that's
the overriding effect I mean then what
happens you know depends on one place to
another but they themselves have this
polarizing effect and that's the way
market forces work we have here a
mixture of market forces and state
intervention and the state intervention
is for the benefit of the wealthy in
fact we want to know how it works have a
look at Clinton's great triumph in
Seattle the this sort of centerpiece
which got so much hoopla was a speech
that he gave in which he announced his
vision for the free market future in the
Pacific and he picked a model company
which he called a model for what other
American corporations should do and in
fact gave the speech and in a building
of that model company a hanger of the
Boeing Corporation that was the model
for the free market future Boeing is a
publicly subsidized corporation Boeing
relies extensively even for its
existence on the Pentagon if it wasn't
for the Pentagon funnel Boeing would not
be the country's major exporter in fact
it would be functioning and the same is
true of the aeronautical industry
altogether the same is true of the other
we mentioned Cray supercomputers would
you know being given to China why decree
supercomputers exist because the public
paid the costs of research and
development for computers and in fact
provide a substantial part of the market
through the whole Pentagon system the
Pentagon
acid and so on these are the kinds of
interventions in market processes that
benefit a certain sector of the economy
the more skilled professional investors
top managers and so on as far as Central
America is concerned though they're
gonna be subjected to market forces in
fact we've done this Costa Rica in
Central America was the one exception to
the Central American model of almost
total social disaster remember this is
the region of the world where we have
had the most influence we take a look at
Central America we learn a lot about
ourselves that's where we've had an
enormous influence because proximity for
a long long time there was one exception
to the disaster that the harder' chamber
that's most of the region namely Costa
Rica which for various reasons had
developed the kind of Western European
sort of Social Democratic character and
was a much richer country than the rest
well you know during the Reagan years
there was a pretty harsh attack on that
Costa Rica's there was a lot of pressure
on Costa Rica to abandon its social
programs to cut back on domestic
investment to open itself up the market
forces in fact to become very much like
the other countries of the region and it
largely succeeded in the United States a
pretty powerful country especially
relative to Central American countries
so the fate for Central America and
after or no NAFTA in my opinion is
unless again unless we do something
about it because they're not powerful
enough to do it themselves is to become
essentially export platforms for
American industry which will use
extremely cheap and repressed labor for
profits here and elimination of jobs
here Gainesville Florida good afternoon
professor thanks for your recent visit
here to the University of Florida I'm a
student in philosophy down here
I appreciate your talk to especially
appreciated the common about the Florida
State University mascot I thought that
was appropriate my question is this
certainly we expect each individual to
make up their own mind about issues and
not make up their mind based on their
political affiliation
but what was unique to NAFTA that
allowed for individuals like say
yourself and Pat Buchanan or say Bob
Dole and Bill Clinton normally on other
sides of the political aisle to hop into
bed together so to speak well
NAFTA was an interesting issue I mean it
was it was a very overwhelmingly it was
a class issue in fact the New York Times
even permitted itself the unusual phrase
class lines which was rarely a term
which rarely appears in the media
because it's a little too revealing but
they did point out that the attitude
toward NAFTA by and large broke down on
class lines corporate power was
overwhelmingly for business and
corporate power was overwhelmingly for
it the workforce was overwhelmingly
against it the media were overwhelmingly
for it but they automatic almost
automatically respond the corporate
interests that despite the enormous
media barrage virtually 100 percent
approval the general population remained
somewhat against it so the latest polls
I saw I think in September October
showed about of the portion of the
population that had an opinion it was
about 55 or 60 percent opposed which is
something that had stayed pretty steady
as for Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot they
were a little bit exceptional he usually
they take a corporate to stand on this
issue they didn't for whatever reason I
think you'd have to look into their
particular point of view and motivations
but you're right that's a funny Alliance
Los Angeles good afternoon hi mmm
professor Chomsky I just took a class
and used this semester at Chapman
University I had a question I was
wondering where do you think now how and
who do you think she regulates the
content of media Janet Reno was just in
Congress speaking about how TV violence
should be stopped do you think that the
companies the media itself could control
themselves or do you think there should
be a regulating force governmental force
behind it
well I'm personally very skeptical about
any form of regulation of any kind of
speech now the media don't even begin
to approximate freedom of speech I mean
this is the kind of freedom where people
who own the place set the rules so
that's not real freedom nevertheless the
idea of X even in that kind of system
heavily skewed towards extreme wealth
personally I'd be reluctant I'm very
reluctant to see any kind of regulation
take place freedom speech is a really
important value we've over the centuries
we've particularly in the United States
won a lot of being one substantial
freedom of speech and I think we ought
to preserve it however with regard to
the media I think there's a much more
serious question should the media be
democratized I mean if the media are our
institutions of private power we can be
quite sure that they're going to have
have a particular take on things they're
going to give a picture of the world
which by and large reflects the
interests of their owners and their
advertisers and other centers of power
in the society and that means that the
attitudes and points of view and
interests of the general public are
going to be marginalized and I think the
answer to that is not you know
regulation its democratization the
specific question of violence on the
media to argument i I think you have to
have a balance between which is not easy
to just determine between allowing full
freedom of expression and imposing some
restrictions on what people are exposed
to so for example even the most
passionate advocate of freedom of speech
does not believe that say I have a right
to go into your living room and put up a
pornographic poster or something that's
an that's you might say my inability to
do that's a restriction of freedom of
speech but I think everyone agrees with
that when you move to a say poster in
Times Square saying you know I don't
know some obscene thing or this graceful
thing the issue becomes more complex
because it's not really private space
it's just the space where you are and
the conflict between the right to
private space and the right to freedom
of speech begins to be ambiguous when
you go to the media becomes even more
ambiguous it's in a sense private space
I mean that's given the way the society
is
just kind of you know you're not
compelled but you're at least driven to
being exposed to it and therefore what's
on it is a kind of involvement in your
private space but at a more remote step
it's at this point that value is
becoming difficult than decisions become
difficult however my own bias at least
would be against and I think the but
that the burden proof has to be on
anyone who wants to introduce any form
of regulation in my opinion Washington
DC good afternoon hi professor Chomsky
I'm also a fan of yours I've read at
least five or six year books and many of
your articles over the years
I work quote within the system here in
Washington DC I had for about ten years
and I was wondering your perspective on
the election of Bill Clinton over George
Bush and whether you think there's any
positive difference whatever for either
the American people or people
internationally of his being elected
there is some difference between what
Bush represented in what Clinton
represented I mean Clinton was
essentially a what's called a moderate
Democrat that I mean a kind of a
right-wing a pro-business Democrat and
the new Democrat and that means it was
very difficult to distinguish that from
moderate Republican but there were some
differences if you look at the campaign
for one thing the Republicans and the
Democrats have rather different
constituencies the Republicans are quite
openly the party of business they don't
pretend to be much else the result is
that they don't really appeal to it
popular constituency the way the
Democrats do they by and large have to
appeal to constitute public constituency
on the basis of jingoist appeals fear
religious fundamentalism and so on you
could tell it from the Republican
convention and that's a substantial part
of the population and that the Democrats
on the other hand put themselves forward
as the popular as the party of you know
the working people and the ethnic
minorities and women and so on in fact
in practice they're just another
another business party but the
difference in constituency shows so when
these parties are in power although the
major decisions that they make keep to
the essential agenda of the state
corporate Nexus which doesn't change a
lot on other issues which are of less
significance to a major private power
they do different things so on issues of
say civil the the Reagan administration
and Bush as well carried out a very
substantial attack on civil rights and I
would and and that harms the interests
of the popular constituency of the
Democrats in fact the general public and
I would expect then I think we already
see a slight difference in that respect
things like say limited amount of family
leave which every just about every
industrial country has in fact far more
than we Bush beatitude Clinton passed it
again that's a sort of throwing crumbs
to the constituency these crumbs are not
minor incidentally with regard to how
what our lives are like but they're very
minor with respect to the major
interests of maximization of power and
wealth so if you read say The Wall
Street Journal the main Business Journal
you'll find they're very enthusiastic
about business and about Clinton and
described him as one of the best
candidates big business could imagine
despite the fact that on say social
programs and other things he may not be
entirely to their taste there were there
was also a difference that you could
detect on major economic policy the
Clinton administration called much more
openly for state intervention to support
and protect major economic centers than
the Republicans did though both they're
all protectionist the Republicans tended
to be a bit more ideological about it
and not to intervene not to call so
openly for third so extremely for
intervention to protect business for
market forces the Clinton called a bit
more for that in fact it's done a bit
more so Clinton's national export
strategy announced in late September
called for an extension of policies that
the Reaganites English had pursue
which we're in violation of cadiz
everyone admitted and Clinton wanted to
extend that and I was put rather well by
the Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen
I said something like I'm tired of this
level playing field business I want the
playing field tilted more toward the
interest of US business so we always
tilt the playing field in the interest
of the US business but they wanted to
tilt it a bit more Buffalo New York good
afternoon hi how you doing good I'm a
graduate student and I'm interested in
educational history and I think that
like the media higher education has
played a role in reinforcing corporate
interests and I'm wondering do you
believe that higher education in the
future is going to become more
democratic or less democratic depends on
what people like you do about it if
there is no popular involvement in this
private power will have its impact which
is significant and that's gonna make it
less democratic for the universities and
the whole educational system to be more
democratic there has to be some counter
balancing force to private power and
that only counterbalancing force can be
public involvement in democratization so
to the extent that such forces exist the
universities can become more democratic
in fact they have become more so in the
last 30 years in my opinion we have with
just a few seconds left you've written
so much already and you mentioned
earlier three or four books in progress
what do you hope comes from your
writings my hope is that it'll stimulate
people to try to ask questions about the
world and find their answers I mean I
have what I think are my answers but I
think if people have a broader range of
analysis and information available to
them they're in a position that come up
with better insight and better
understanding early so I hope and then
of course I'll do something about it
because just having the ideas in your
mind doesn't change the world Noam
Chomsky is professor of linguistics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology thank you very much
and we thank you for your calls and your
comments have a good afternoon
