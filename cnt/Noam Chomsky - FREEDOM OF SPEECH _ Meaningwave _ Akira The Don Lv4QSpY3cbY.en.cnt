why the handling
professionals wonderful
there's no way of responding if somebody
calls to have an anti-semite what can
you say I'm not an anti-semite somebody
says you're you're a racist you're a
Nazi or something this you always lose I
mean the person who throws mud always
win it because there's no way of
responding to such charges freedom

I do not think that the state ought to
have a right to determine it started at
first and to punish people at CVS
I'm not willing to give the state that
right even if they happen to be at the
gas streams in person but I'm saying if
you believe in freedom speech you
believe in freedom speech for beauty all
right
I mean burbles was in favor of freedom
speech for busy life right so a starling
if you're in favor of freedom speech
that means your favorite creams be
precisely for views you despise but
otherwise you're not a flavor of freedom
speech otherwise you're not a flavor
freedom speech there's two positions you
haven't written speech the inside which
position you want

[Music]
with regard to my defense of the utterly
offensive the people who express utterly
offensive views the slightest doubt that
every commissar says you're defending
that person's views now I'm not I'm not
defending is right to express them the
difference is crucial and the difference
has been understood
fascist circles since the
century if you're in favor of freedom
speech that means you're in favor of
dream speech precisely for views you
despise otherwise you gotta flavor
through the speech and then you can
decide which position you want
freedom speech
[Music]
freedom speech
free of speech
you're in favor of freedom speech
spice leave reviews
freedom speechless otherwise you're not
favored for instance otherwise
save a dream speech
favor freedom speech that means nicely
for abusing his wife
save our dream speech you
