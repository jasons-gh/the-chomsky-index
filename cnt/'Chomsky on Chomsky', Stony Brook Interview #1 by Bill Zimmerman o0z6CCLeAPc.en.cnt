Noam Chomsky is a world-renowned
political activist writer and professor
of linguistics at MIT the New York Times
Book Review said of him judged in terms
of the power range and novelty and
influence of his thought Noam Chomsky is
arguably the most important intellectual
alive to which he adds yeah nobody ever
quotes the next sentence
how can he write such terrible things
about the u.s. foreign policy or
something like that that that edition
kind of made your day didn't it oh yeah
that made me feel I wasn't doing
something wrong
tell me a little bit about your
background you grew up in Philadelphia
your parents were Hebrew teachers I
believe mm-hmm it was basically
first-generation immigrant family they
were very much immersed in the local
Jewish community he bridge occasion
this is 1930s so it's early Zionism
pre-state Zionism that was the media and
my own life was soon became my own life
but that was the background that I came
out of and you went to camp as I recall
you later on when I was a young teenager
living 12 we went to Hebrew speaking
camps and then I first as a camper then
later his counselor oh you were
proficient in Hebrew very early
reasonably proficient but it's a matter
of measuring but yes I get by and I read
written read very easily I had read a
lot of I grew up immersed in Hebrew
literature Bible and so on in Hebrew you
got part of I guess your political
education on a street corner in New York
in a sense you had an uncle who this is
again the 1930s in the early forties so
the whole family
mostly unemployed unemployed
seamstresses working people and so on
but there were few vet jobs and one
uncle had a severe disability and he was
able to get a newsstand under one of the
New Deal type programs that were around
in those days so the newsstand was the
place which supported half the family
but he was also a very he himself had
never gone through school but he was
very well educated more so than almost
anybody I met and the newsstand became a
center for a lot of emigres
intellectuals from Europe who hang
around there in the evenings and have
fascinating discussions and there was a
lot of funds I just be serving
newspapers and listening so you would
want jump on the train from so as soon
as I was old enough to take the train by
myself at 12 or so I head off to New
York as soon as I had a chance stay with
my relatives who were a very lively
bunch of Jewish working-class left all
involved in intellectual culture so a
mixture of strange Marxist groups and
the Budapest string quartet and so on
and so forth and all the very few of
them had had anything in the way of
formal education except very elementary
but didn't matter and then I spend my
time wandering up and down something
that's long since disappeared but the
fourth Avenue below Union Square used to
be full of little secondhand bookstores
again a lot of European exiles would
have their own particular slant you know
Spanish anarchism
that was fascinating - they're very
eager to talk to some young person
coming in was that usual so got special
treatment and they picked up a lot a lot
of literature - in fact when I started
writing about these things
years later I used a lot of primary
documentation that I'd picked up around
that time which wasn't available
elsewhere what kind of stuff do they
talk about the newsstand there was a lot
of and many of the anti greys were
happened to be psychiatrists like German
Jewish psychiatrist so there's a lot of
Freud Steckle that sort of thing and
then every variety of left-wing politics
you can think of these were very lively
days and political discussion was common
and just part of everybody's life and
how did you discover linguistics as you
were field through politics actually
yeah this is back in Philadelphia mint
zellig harris I was about I guess 16 or
17 and pretty bored with college I was
thinking of dropping out but I happened
to meet him through political contacts
he himself was was a very influential
figure among young intellectuals mostly
Jewish but not completely much more so
than is known for the in write much but
many people passed through his influence
of many of them well-known and I was one
of the younger ones and he was his
interests were sort of independent left
sort of anti-bolshevik left and what was
then called giantism now it would be
called anti-zionism commitment to a
future by national Jewish
the working-class based community in
what was then Palestine which was part
of the lioness movement at the time now
it would be considered different and I
was already interested in that so
meeting him was a exciting became an
influence I later discovered he was
professor of linguistics at at Penn and
in fact you know one of the leading
figures in the world got drawn into his
courses back into college
thank you have come to change your views
about Israel Israeli politics over the
years not that much I still believe
pretty much what I know of course it's
different now than when I was 12 years
old but a basically the same point of
view I'm in these circumstances have
changed but my own position hasn't
changed very much what is your position
and how of the circumstance has changed
well remember that was pre state right
so of course everything changed when the
state was established although I
maintain my involvement and interest and
if I came pretty close to living there
my wife and I spent some time on a
kibbutz we might have gone back at this
question but I was opposed to the
establishment of a Jewish state which
again was part of the dynasty at the
time not a huge part but there was a
element of it that thought a Jewish
state is a bad mistake I thought so then
I still think so a Jewish state as
opposed to a democratic state it the two
are inconsistent I mean people can try
whatever manipulation they like but if
the United States were a Christian state
in anything but symbolism it wouldn't be
a democratic state I mean you know
taking Sunday office okay but if there's
real discriminatory legislation and
practice that distinguished Christians
from non-christians or whites from
non-whites to that extent it would be a
flawed democracy almost by definition
and that's intrinsic in
in the form of the Jewish state that was
established I'm in the high court in
Israel actually declared it to be the
state of the Jewish people in Israel in
the Diaspora so my state but not the
state of a Palestinian Arab citizen of
Israel and this shows itself in all
kinds of ways but it became much more
all of these problems became far more
exacerbated after 1967 when the military
occupation began it's known it's 36th
year and then all sorts of things
happened I mean in in 1971 Israel really
had to make a what turned out to be a
fateful decision
they received an offer from Egypt
through the UN mediator Gunnar yari to
have a each of offered full peace treaty
if Israel wouldn't withdraw just from
Egyptian territory not nothing about the
Palestinians no West Bank it was
discussed internally in Israel and the
now we know it from released cabinet
records but then in the Hebrew press
they knew that it was a possibility of
peace and integration into the region
the choice was that or expansion which
means permanent confrontation dependants
crucial dependence on the United States
and they chose the latter course and a
lot of things have followed from that
which are in my view very harmful to the
society and extremely dangerous and
leading to the constant threat of a very
serious war plus 35 years of persecution
of an of an oppressed population that
has changed things enormously do you see
any end to that yeah very simple and in
fact everyone in the world knows what it
is and has known for years the end is a
diplomatic set I mean it gets more
remote the longer you delay it but the
end has been for since the 1970s a
political settlement on the
international
recognized border that free pre-war
border preached in 67 with mutual and
minor territorial adjustments and other
arrangements about other matters the
crucial matter is territorial now that's
been the international consensus since
the mid 1970s the US has unilaterally
blocked it and still does and as long as
that continues there won't be a
political settlement
what about Jerusalem Jerusalem
you can finish one way or another I mean
theoretically it's supposed under the
original UN resolutions are supposed to
be in there nationalized city okay
that's not going to happen
but the Jewish and Arab neighborhoods
could be except mostly Jewish mostly
Arab neighborhoods could be separated
two capitals could be set up side by
side but the Palestinian one would have
to have access to the Palestinian state
that's the crucial issue and many people
have pointed out I think correctly that
Jerusalem is a problem you could
probably settle in 15 minutes the main
problems are the territorial boundaries
as we speak the White House has
announced that it will declare an end to
the war in Iraq tomorrow in your opinion
what was that war all about well we can
be certain about one thing the white
house made it very clear that nothing it
said could be taken seriously so we know
that the reasons they gave can't be the
reasons the way we know that is because
they are contradicted every day I mean
one day it's a single question as they
put it is Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction if they get rid of the
weapons of mass destruction it's all
over the next day it turned out that
didn't make any difference what they did
about their weapons
we had to impose it around regime what's
called regime change change and the
third day it was some other stories so
we can put aside the official
explanations they made it clear to us
that they're not to be taken seriously
so then we have to speculate what was it
about and I think it's some pretty clear
plausible explanations I mean first of
all there's a background issue which
doesn't account for the timing of the
war but it's always in the background
and that is that Iraq has the second
largest oil reserves in the world has
always been clear that one way or
another the US would regain control over
them or seek to do so it does dominate
the u.s. does dominate the Gulf energy
producing region which is by far the
largest and richest in the world and
will be for another couple of
generations that's been policy since the
Second World War the Iraq was kind of an
anomaly and that it broke out of it and
it there would be an effort to get it
back in that was certain what about the
timing well the timing is kind of
striking if you look at the propaganda
about invasion of Iraq it really begins
last September I mean it was sort of
simmering in the background but in
September that's when Condoleezza Rice
told us about the you know the mushroom
cloud and the massive government
propaganda disseminated uncritically by
the media was produced about Iraq being
a threat to our survival and intimations
that Iraq was behind the September 11th
attacks and was planning new ones and
that showed up very quickly in the polls
by the end of September of majority of
the population actually believed that
Iraq was a serious threat to u.s.
security and over the months the number
of people who believed that Iraq was
involved in the September 11th attacks
has reached something like the
percent probably there's there's nobody
in the world who believes anything like
this including CIA but it did come to be
public opinion and those opinions are
very strongly correlated with support
for the war not surprisingly but why
September well call other things
happened in September one thing that
happened was it was the opening of the
midterm election campaign and as karl
rove campaign manager had already
informed republican activists they
cannot go into the campaign with social
and economic issues being prominent or
they'll get smashed they have to be
security issues which will lead people
to they hope correctly to suppress their
concerns about jobs pensions and Enron
and so on in favor of safety which will
flock the power and it worked
barely the Rove has already said they're
going to do the next the same for the
presidential campaign and in fact that
ran right through the eighties when the
same people were running Washington
pushing the panic button every year over
something or other the other thing that
happened which I think is even more
significant is that they announced the
national security strategy in September
which calls for it sent plenty of
shutters around the world including the
u.s. foreign policy elite this was a
substantial change in official policy
and there are precedents but it's never
been official policy before there was a
policy of openly announced intention to
rule the world by force and to prevent
any potential challenge to that
domination it's called pre-emptive war
but it's not pre-emptive its preventive
and even that's an exaggeration we'll
just attack anyone is in the way well
when you announce a doctrine you have to
illustrate otherwise nobody takes it
seriously
to illustrate the doctrine of preventive
war
you have to pick the appropriate target
first of all it has to be weak and
defenseless
there's no point attacking anybody who
can fight back that's ridiculous
so has to be weak and defenseless on the
other hand that can't be say you know
run D because that's worthless who wants
it has to be weak defenseless and
important okay that spells at rank and
that was a perfect petri dish is the New
York Times called a test case for to
illustrate the new norm of preventive
war to get the world understand we mean
it and I think those factors probably
account for the timing in the background
is the long term interest but as I say
you can't these have to be speculations
because there's no official information
that means anything it's all self
contradictory what do you expect will
follow in Iraq do you expect democracy
to blossom their special kind of
democracy we have a hundred years of
experience in our backyard to go by the
US has dominated Central America in the
Caribbean for a century it's had plenty
of influence in other places and it has
tolerated even foster democracy but on a
condition the Democratic decision has to
conform the u.s. policy if country's
democratic choices go in opposition to
US policy the government's overthrown
either by coup or invasion or economic
strangulation or something rather and in
fact this is extremely explicit in
policy formation it takes discipline not
to see it so for example in the case of
Cuba the u.s. international terrorist
attack on Cuba and that's what it is
that began within months after Castro's
takeover was very sharply escalated by
the Kennedy administration we now have
the internal documents that this
describe what they had in mind then it's
the same as everywhere else that
Guatemala Iran everywhere they what they
state is that the very existence of the
Castro regime is successful defiance of
US policies going back 150 years
policies are that the region has to be
subordinated to u.s. power and this is
successful defiance of that doesn't
matter what they do they've got to
conform the wars in Central America in
the 1980s were to impose a form of
democracy which would be quote the
leading specialists top down forms of
democracy in which traditional elites
mean who who have been associated with
the United States retained power Jim
quoting Thomas Carruthers it's a leading
historian but also writes from the
inside he was part of reagan's so-called
democracy enhancement programs in the
State Department and that's a correct
characterization and that's what will
happen in Iraq I mean if the majority
the population happens to be Shia
suppose they call for a you know Islamic
state linked to Iran the United States
and never tolerate that fact has already
said - you can have a democracy as long
as you do what we say you have felt that
politics are driven by the economic
interests of what you call the
privileged elite can you tell me about
that and who these people are first of
all that's not my opinion that's the
opinion of a hundred percent of people
who work on foreign affairs and it's an
opinion with which you agree yeah it's
almost a truism and it's true of every
country not just the United States I
mean there's an internal distribution of
power in every country you know it's not
that everybody is equal and the internal
distribution of power reflects itself
and in decision-making in the state
system in different ways I mean if a
country has a
powerful union movement for example
there will be a labor contribution to
policy United States doesn't have that
we have basically business parties and
there's a there's a concentrated sector
of economic power corporate sector
linked to linked closely to government
and they tend to set the basic framework
for policy choices it's not mechanical
you know we can deduce that this or that
policy is going to come out but it's a
very powerful framework from which
there's very little deviation actually
the media don't even tolerate any
discussion of anything beyond it except
very much of the margins even if the
population happens I mean there are many
striking cases where the population is
pretty strongly opposed to policy but if
this there's a split between a lead
opinion and popular opinion the these
issues just don't even show up in
elections
I mean international economic
arrangements are a striking example the
populations almost but by substantial
majorities opposed the most of the
arrangements
there's near elite consensus as a result
they just don't show up except very
marginally in political debate and
political campaigns and other things
actually what I said about the Middle
East is another example roughly I think
about two-thirds of the population has
it supports the general international
consensus that I mentioned but the USA
lead opinion does not as a result the
issue just doesn't come up the writer
Tom Wolfe calls this the old cabal
theory and implies that it's kind of
nutty I guess there's that sort of
criticism if you think it's nutty for
people with wealth and power to use
their influence it's about as nutty is
the fact that the Sun rises every
morning a couple of years statements I
will quote now the Japanese bombing of
Pearl Harbor saved tens of
millions of lives how did that happen
it's not supportive it it's just saying
you cannot evaluate an action by looking
at the range of consequences actually
probably in India alone it saved tens of
millions of lives also kicking the
British yeah one of the results of the
jet wasn't the intention of the bombing
of Pearl Harbor but if you look at the
events that unfolded one of the things
that happened is that the Europeans
mostly left Asia not easily so the
French fought a brutal war the Dutch
Florida war they finally left and the
effect of that in Asia was dramatic and
if you look at the demographic patterns
and say India there haven't been any
major famine since the British left
there were terrible famines before in
fact India you know they barely
developed during the British period
hundreds a year it had been the
commercial and one of the commercial and
industrial centers of the world when the
British took it over the British turned
it into an impoverished agricultural
society with a wealthy elite and some
infrastructure you know based on their
dominance but there's a miserable
situation if people like neighbor who
was an Anglophile described the British
is you know like the Nazis after
independence it's not a wonderful place
by any means but at least the massive
famine stopped and some development
picked up and it's much the same
throughout Asia I said so an indirect
consequence of the Japanese aggression
and violence happened to be the
liberation of a good deal of Asia that's
incidentally why plenty of Asian
nationalists supported the Japanese for
example sukarno and Indonesia support of
the Japanese all the way through this
anti-fascist but supported the Japanese
because they were going to kick the debt
yeah and it's the same throughout so you
know actions have all kinds of
consequences but you cannot justify
Japanese atrocities
an aggression on the basis of the fact
that inadvertent consequences happen to
lead the deliberation of Asia Asia that
was the context in which that comment
was made and it's I don't think there's
any doubt of the historical accuracy of
the comment the u.s. bombing in
Afghanistan was silent genocide no what
I said is that if they that the
assumptions they were making were that
that could well be a consequence
remember the bombing of Afghanistan was
taken on the assumption that it might
well lead put millions of people at risk
of starvation that assumption was very
widespread you can read it and Harvard's
a major International Journal
international security the New York
Times for example
estimated after a month that the number
of people at risk of starvation had
risen by fifty percent from five million
to seven and a half million and in fact
right after September 11th even before
the bombing of the US ordered Pakistan
to terminate food supplies that were
keeping a good part of the population at
the edge of survival so that policy
under the assumptions in which the
policy was being conducted could well
have led to silent genocide that's one
of the reasons why rational people
should oppose policies like that you
said that if the Nuremberg principles
were applied every post World War two
president would be
indictable probably true can we run run
down them real fast water lies now or do
it you would indict even for Eisenhower
overthrew the conservative nationalist
government of Iran with the military
coup he overthrew the first and last
democratic government in Guatemala by
military coup and invasion leading to
years of in Iran it led to 25 years of
brutal dictatorship finally overthrown
in 79 in Guatemala it led to massive
atrocities which are still continuing
that's after almost 50 years in
Indonesia this wasn't known until
recently but he conducted the major
clandestine terror operation of the
post-war period up until Cuban Nicaragua
in an effort to break up Indonesia
strip off the outer islands where most
of the resources are and undermine the
what was then considered as a threat of
Indonesian democracy Indonesia was to
free and open it was allowing a
political party of the poor to
participate they were gaining a lot of
ground so that the Eisenhower supported
and helped instigate a military
rebellion in the outer islands this is
just for starters these are all
indictable offences one by Kennedy
Kennedy was one of the worst Kennedy
first of all invaded South Vietnam
during the Eisenhower administration
they had blocked the political
settlement in 1954 and instituted a kind
of a Latin American style terror State
which had killed maybe 60 or 70 thousand
people by at the end of the Eisenhower
period and had instigated a response
reaction Kennedy recognized that it
couldn't be controlled internally so he
simply invaded in 1962
about a third of the bombing missions
who were carried out by the US Air Force
it in South u.s. planes with South
Vietnamese insignia the u.s. pilot are
they author he authorized napalm he
began the use of chemical weapons to
destroy food crops they began programs
which drove millions of people into what
amounted the concentration camps
that's aggression in the case of Cuba it
was just a massive campaign of
international terrorism which almost led
to the destruction of the world led to
the Missile Crisis and we can continue
again these are all indictable offences
Johnson well Johnson expanded the war
and into China to the point where ended
up probably leaving three or four
million people dead he invaded the
Dominican Republic to block what looked
like a potential democratic revolution
there supported the Israeli occupation
in its early stages again we can go
around the world make you take them take
say Carter I'll get there but Nixon's
next the next thing we don't even have
to talk about we can skip that one okay
Ford then Ford well for it was only
there for a short time but long enough
to endorse the Indonesian invasion of
East Timor which became about as close
to genocide as anything in the modern
period they pretended to oppose it but
secretly supported effect not so
secretly the u.s. immediately after the
invasion the US did join the rest of the
world and formally condemning it at the
Security Council but ambassador Moynihan
was kind enough to explain to us in his
words that his instructions were to
render the United Nations utterly
ineffective in any actions it might take
to counter the Indonesian and great
invasion and he says proudly that he did
this with considerable success his next
sentence says in the next few months it
seems that about sixty thousand people
were killed and then he goes off to the
next topic that's the first few months
went on to probably hundreds of
thousands sick formerly the u.s.
announced the boycott of weapons but
secretly increased the supply of weapons
including the counterinsurgency
equipment so that the Indonesians could
consummate the invasion that's just a
short period in office but that's
indictable seriously in fact that's a
major war crime Carter Carter increased
as the Indonesian atrocities were
increasing they peaked in 1978 Carter's
flow of weapons to Indonesia increased
when Congress imposed a human rights
restrictions but then there was a human
rights movement in Congress to block the
flow of advanced weaponry to Indonesia
Carter arranged through Mondale vice
president to get Israel to send us
Skyhawks to Indonesia to enable
Indonesia to complete what turned out to
be near Jenna's killing maybe a quarter
of the population or something in the in
the Middle East Carter just won the
Nobel Prize his great achievement was
the Camp David agreements the Camp David
agreements are presented as a diplomatic
triumph for the United States in fact
they were a diplomatic catastrophe at
Camp David the United States and Israel
accepted finally Egypt 1971 offer
which they had then read us I rejected
at the time except that now it was worse
from the us-israeli point of view
because it included the Palestinians in
order to accept get Israel to accept
Egypt's 1971 offer after a major war in
atrocities and so on
Carter raised aid military and other aid
Israel to more than fifty percent of
total aid worldwide is really used it at
once in exactly the way they said they
were going to do and as every sane
person knew as an opportunity to attack
their northern neighbor first in 1978
then in 1982 and to increase integration
of the occupied territories and that's
for starters we can continue Reagan I
don't think we have to talk about that
one either
I mean Reagan is the first president to
have been condemned by the International
Court of Justice for what they called
the unlawful use of force meaning
international terrorism in the war
against Nicaragua again that's just for
starters they also the Security Council
endorsed it in two resolutions both of
which were vetoed by the United States
Bush one
well fertig in with the invasion of
Panama the invasion of Panama which
according to the Panamanians killed
about 3,000 people since it's never
investigated we don't know if that's
true or not this was done in order to
kidnap a disobedient thug who had been
supported by the United States right
through his worst atrocities Noriega
Noriega was brought to Florida and tried
for crimes that he committed mostly on
the CIA payroll
okay that's aggression we could go into
the details of the war in Iraq but there
were plainly opportunities for they
might not have worked we don't know but
there were opportunities for diplomatic
settlement which the Bush administration
fused to consider and incidentally the
press would not report with a single
exception and Long Island Newsday which
didn't report the whole story throughout
accurately and is the only newspaper in
the country to have done so the Bush
administration then did it to act and
the attack was carried out and in a
manner which is criminal under the laws
of war they attacked infrastructure and
if you attack New York City and you
destroy the electrical system our system
the sewage systems and so on
that amounts to biological warfare and
that's the nature of the attack then
came a sanctions regime which it's
mostly Clinton that began with Bush
which is by conservative estimates
killed hundreds of thousands of people
while strengthening Saddam Hussein that
takes us off to Clinton which that's the
beginning that's by no means the end to
Clem through it well we can run through
that one case of Isis but there plenty
of others Bush too let's take let's go
on with Clinton okay I'm one of
Clinton's minor s with minor escapades
very minor I was sending a couple of
cruise missiles to the Sudan to destroy
what they knew to be a pharmaceutical
plant there was no intelligence failure
according to the only estimates we have
from the German ambassador and the
director of Regional Director of Near
East Foundation was does field work and
Sudan both of them estimated several
tens of thousands of deaths from one
cruising speck very serious somebody did
that to us we'd regarded as bad news and
again we can continue during in the
Middle East for example the Clinton
began by declaring past UN resolutions
the words of his administration obsolete
and anachronistic okay so we're finished
with that no more international law then
comes Apollo a period called a peace
says accept the during the peace process
Israeli us that Israeli settlement which
means settlement paid for by the US
taxpayer and supported by US military
aid and diplomacy continually increased
the most extreme year was Clinton's last
year the highest level of settlement the
highest since 1992 meanwhile the
territories were canonized broken up
into small regions with infrastructure
projects and new settlement I don't know
what you call that but it's under
military occupation and if anyone else
was doing it we'd call it a work and
again we can continue I wish to I don't
think we have to discuss your call okay
how does well I want to get back to one
thing you said news day apparently got
off the reservation is somehow what
happened there having no idea but one
were particularly one reporter knew
Troy's kept reporting everything that
was happening I have a guess I mean what
was going on was that he was reporting
leaks from the government the government
US State Department was leaking reports
from August August 19 right up to
through December planning for the war
leaking reports saying that Iraq was
making offers that the State Department
regarded as serious and negotiable maybe
not acceptable but negotiable now you
know no one in the state department
leaks reports to a suburban newspaper
what I assume was happening was that
they were leaking him to the New York
Times which was refusing to print them
and then they leaked them the Newsday
which appears on every newsstand in New
York City with a big full front-page
headline saying you know Iraq offers
this and that I mean can you think of
any other explanation if you were in the
State Department would you leak
documents to Newsday but it's a it's a
part of an immense cooperation
day times we are going and somehow that
newspaper alone and this one reporter
and Faye who I don't know but he was
doing very good job that kept reporting
but and what typically happened is that
Newsday would report it big front-page
story and a couple of days later in The
Times and the sort of back pages you'd
see a phrase saying well reports claim
that the Iraq made an offer but the
White House denies it it's a very few
people in the country knew about this
we've got a few minutes left before
we're going to open this for questions
from me from the people here in the
studio you've said either the general
population will take control of our
destiny or there will be no destiny for
anyone to control why is that so I think
we think we are in a situation with I
mean the human species has developed the
capacity to destroy itself and
everything else that's been true since
the Second World War and we are edging
very close to the possibility of that
happening it's come very close in the
past I mean during the Cuban Missile
Crisis which Arthur Schlesinger
described as the most dangerous moment
in human history we just learned last
October how dangerous it was last
October it was revealed at the at
retrospective conference of participants
in Havana
American Russian and Cuban that the
world was literally one word away from
terminal nuclear war Russian submarine
commanders turns out had a
nuclear-tipped missiles and they were
under attack by American destroyers at
the edge of and
these quarantine zone they assumed that
nuclear war was going on two of the
commanders ordered the missiles sent
that would have led to a devastating
response they got Moscow and comes New
York and then were over one commander
countermanded that was a consequence of
a international terrorist war aimed at
regime change those notions are right in
the headlines and that's we're coming
very close to that now I mean the
preventive war doctrine last September
it's just instructing people in the
world that you better develop weapons of
mass destruction or a means of terrorism
in order than heater the United States
where's that gonna lead or take another
domain nobody really understands in any
detail what's going on with a climate
that's a complicated issue but there's a
near consensus among scientists that
we're playing with fire you know could
be it's kind of like Afghanistan you
you're risking the possibility of very
severe destruction if anything goes
wrong these are sort of nonlinear
processes I mean a slight change could
have a big effect and you don't know
what's going to happen you know maybe an
ice age and Europe or some other thing
well you know we're very near the edge
in nuclear weapons development and other
weapons of mass destruction and policies
that are creating international chaos in
destroying possibly destroying an
environment in which decent survival is
possible nobody you can't none of this
is predictable it's just all too close
for comfort and it things are tending in
that direction I mean and it's been it's
it's not particularly new I would take
say the history of Europe now for
hundreds of years the Europe was the
most savage place in the world the main
activity of Europeans was slaughtering
each other I mean
on the side conquering most of the world
in 1945 they called it off why well very
straightforward reason it was understood
by French and Germans and British that
the next time they play the
centuries-old game of slaughtering each
other it's gonna be the end of the world
because they had developed means of
destruction so enormous that you just
can't do it anymore so now Europe is a
peaceful region but unless that extends
to the world same problems internalize
what's the good news the good news is
that there's lots of good news a part of
it is that as a result of the activism
in the last 40 years which has been
extensive the United States is a much
more civilised country than it was in
the past and the same has happened all
over good parts of the world there's now
extensive under there were all kinds of
things that we didn't even exist before
women's rights
minority rights an environmental
movement anti-nuclear movements
international solidarity movements
global justice movements none of us
existed 40 or 45 years ago most of it is
post 1960s that started at all that can
it took off it's changed hasn't changed
institutions but it has changed
consciousness and awareness and it's
true of a large part of the world
actually much of the initiative for
these developments is coming from the
south and there's a good reason why the
world Social Forum meets in Brazil not
in Paris or New York that's because
that's where the leading edge of the
activism is for significant social
change throughout much of the south the
north is joined to an extent and these
are hopeful possibilities for popular
movements reversing a course that's a
very dangerous one on that note of
optimism we'll take questions now from
people here
I noticed that you mentioned that when
US government tries to pick up a target
to attack they usually pick up a weak
defenseless and important target so
since the Iraqi issue has now has been
Rinna announced it to be officially end
and also it is also said that as there
are several possible targets at US
government my pick up so one example
might be and the the North Korea but it
is recently it recently it has been said
that the US Army stationed in North
Korea have retreated to to Japan so
every excuse fish in South Korea I also
sorry in South Korea sorry has has
retreated to Japan but it seems that
North it seems that the war will break
out I mean according to some people's
belief but it seems that North Korea is
a country with almost no resources but
it's also quite defensive and it has it
is said that has nuclear weapons so I
wonder whether you have any opinion on
this issue and what kind of benefits
will be brought to America if you know
the war breaks well first of all the
visit about attacking defenseless
enemies I actually happen to be
paraphrasing a leaked intelligence
document from the bush one
administration when they came into
office like every administration they
call for an intelligence survey of the
world usually we don't find out about it
for 30 or 40 years until it gets
Declassified but in this case someone
leaked a paragraph from it and it was
published by Maureen Dowd in the New
York Times her column is considered a
kind of gossip column so people don't
read it very carefully but she actually
did publish in 1990 or so the paragraph
that was leaked from that document and
what it said is that in the case of
confrontation with much weaker enemies
which it's tacitly assumed that the only
one
to attack in the case of confrontations
with much weaker enemies of the United
States must defeat them decisively and
rapidly because otherwise political
support will it Road it's not the 1960s
when Kennedy could carry out a war for
years and Johnson could escalate it with
no protest now you got to build up the
enemy to look like a massive force and
then destroy him decisively and rapidly
and you got to pick a much weaker one
and that's a sensible you may not like
it but it's a rational doctrine and if
you look at the Wars of the 90s that's
what they are the North Korea case is a
complicated one the what the United
States has been telling the world loud
and clear for the last couple of months
is that if you want to prevent us from
attacking you you'd better have a
deterrent I mean Iraq had no deterrent
so therefore even smash it and North
Korea had a deterrent not nuclear
weapons incidentally massed artillery
they have massed artillery aimed that
Seoul and that the American forces there
and unless the Pentagon can figure out a
way to take them out with precision
guided munitions before they're used it
could just be devastating actually the
predictions and the Clinton years from
the Pentagon were that if the US was to
go to war they was one general put it
they better have a hundred thousand body
bags ready
so North Korea has a deterrent which is
conventional nuclear weapons they may
have a couple of years from now but
that's not the issue now and that held
off an attack well why is North Korea
important you're completely right as no
resources it's one of the poorest most
most horrifying countries in the world
but it's right in the middle of a
crucial area this whole region is a
rapidly developing economic region it
has tremendous resources in Siberia
you know lots of gas and oil and other
resources has huge concern countries
that are industrialized and need the
resources particularly Japan and South
Korea but now China - which is now a
resource importer and there's a good
reason to expect that that whole region
is going to go off in its own
independent direction the United States
does not want that visits it wants that
region to be subordinated the u.s. power
and North Korea happens right in the
middle of it if there's going to be
pipelines from you know Siberia to South
Korea and off to Japan and that's where
they're going to go so it itself has no
material significance but its position
in one of the most rapidly developing
regions of the world definitely does
I appreciate your emphasis on hope as
where as activism as being a source of
hope and as a as a academic and training
and a political organizer in the last
two years I've I've experienced an
inertia in the academic class so to
speak that I've never experienced before
and I've been organizing for a number of
years including the first Gulf War and
so the first part of the question is why
do you think it is that a tab salutely
the most critical time the most you know
the mask has been removed in a lot of
sense of this of this push an expansion
of empire so to speak that that's the
time that the such extreme inertia has
set in and that people feel so impotent
and then the second part of the question
is how do you recommend breaking through
that particularly an academic class
because they have such resources and I'm
wondering if something like the French
based attack organization may be
somewhat of a model and I just want to
get your opinion on that well if first
of all your age is significant the
academic world has never been a source
of a rarely been a source of activism it
usually comes from somewhere else I mean
there was a brief period in which it was
true in the late 60s late 60s not in the
earlier period when parts of the
academic world
the students incidentally very few
faculty did become actively engaged in
elite universities and elsewhere then it
kind of died down in the 1980s happen to
be an extremely activist period but it
was not coming from the academic world
it was coming more from churches in the
Midwest and places like that the Central
America solidarity movement was
extremely significant didn't get a lot
of attention because it was not coming
from elite centers but this is the first
time in the history of imperialism
hundreds of years that people from the
Imperial country actually went to live
with the victims to try to help them and
protect them I mean nobody in France
went to live in Algeria during the
Algerian war to live in an Algerian
village or ever the Vietnam War was
never even thought about and the whole
history of European and US imperialism
had never happened that happened on a
very substantial scale in the 1980s
that's the reason why you now have
volunteers in many parts of the world
including the israeli-occupied their
authorities so all an outgrowth of this
but the academic world was almost
completely not involved the same is true
in the 1990s hasn't been the academic
world
I like the global justice movements
which are the biggest ones though they
didn't commit
I mean there's students involved you
know a couple of faculty are in there
but it's mostly coming from elsewhere
yeah I didn't mean to imply that
actually I didn't imply that academia in
the academic world so rightly we should
be concerned about what goes on there
you know you and I aren't going to
organize Steelworkers but we can do
things where we live so that's just the
right question and what can change it is
what's always done in the past you know
people working hard to educate to
organize to raise issues I mean we have
tremendous privileges you know in most
parts of the world people try to do
things like this they face torture
assassination
something or other we don't face
anything you know we're completely free
we have a legacy of freedom that's
unparalleled we have enormous resources
and privileges get every opportunity we
can think of what's lacking is will I
said one of the things that's common in
a kind of a youth culture student
culture like the academic world is a
very short attention span you know you
figure things have to be done soon and
if they don't work in a week you know we
quit like I went to a demonstration and
nothing happened okay now I'm going to
quit if you want anything to change it's
got a it means work over a long time
lots of defeats occasional victories you
know ultimately you get somewhere you
think of any popular movement has ever
done anything
yeah abolitionism you know women's
rights anything you think of that's the
way it works now that was what was
different in the working class culture
that I grew up in and as a kid
these came from movements that thought
you're gonna have to work hard for a
long time to try to achieve something
and that's yes that's what happens it's
not going to be any quick victories but
there are plenty of opportunities and
just have to keep attack yeah well
attack is an interesting group and it's
done important things it's fairly elite
outfit but it's one of the groups that
was instrumental in setting up the world
Social Forum and they're pretty narrowly
focused on a few crucial issues like one
of their big issues is Tobin tax you
know tax on financial interactions which
is probably a good idea there's other
possibilities like it and it's it's been
a very influential and important group
and it's starting in the United States
incidentally so they're subgroups here
it's international based in France and
it's the kind of thing that could be
part of a serious u.s. organizing effort
but only part I think
yes sir given human rights violations by
corporations I was wondering how you
make your purchasing decisions and if
there are any products that you don't
purchase well plenty of things I don't
purchase but not really for that reason
I mean these are questions of tactics I
mean do you affect Human Rights but
let's take coca-cola which is a big
thing around here I understand coca-cola
is has just been it's narrowly scraped
by a district court case in Florida that
was brought by the Steel Workers in
support of Colombian workers in a
subsidiary of a coca-cola plant which is
one of the most vicious anti-union
plants almost anywhere and the
particular case was a union activist who
was murdered by paramilitaries in the
plant and the steel workers who are
pressing these human rights cases for
Colombians they can't do it themselves
are using provisions of American law
which do exist and have sometimes been
applied and they've brought a case in
Florida which got to the district court
and they sort of had a half victory the
district court severed coca cola from
the case but kept the subsidiary well
you know severing coca-cola was a
technicality
so does that mean you should stop buying
Coca Cola well if you stop buying Coca
Cola is that going to help union
activists in Colombia that's the
question you have to ask these are and
you know I don't think there's a simple
answer like if you stop buying coke coal
that's not gonna have any effect if
there was a massive boycott of it they'd
notice it in the corporate headquarters
and and might do something like for
example Nike and reap sealant Reebok or
something the guys who make sneakers and
things like that have modified somewhat
they're horrendous human rights
practices in plants in Asia as a result
of pressure
becoming from students and that yeah
that had an effect but these are
questions you just have to answer in
terms of their likely consequences for
people who are suffering there's no
point making gestures Sasser noam
chomsky thank you very much okay
