so you just just come to my question
about the the BDS movement because
that's well of criticism about your
position in Palestine is coming from the
last sort of three paragraphs of the
call for BDS
pretty much says we representative a
person to society call upon
international civil society organization
and people of conscience all over the
world to impose broad boycotts and
implement divestment initiative against
Israel similar to those who fly to South
Africa in the battle arena we appeal to
you to pressure the respective states to
impose embargoes and sanctions in Israel
we also invite contentious Israeli to
support this call for the sake of
justice and genuine peace then there's
three steps is ending the occupation and
colonization of Arab lands and is making
the world recognizing the fundamental
rights of the Arab Palestinian citizen
of Israel to full equality and
respecting protecting and promoting the
rights of question refugees to return to
their homes and property as stipulated
in UN resolution 194 when you read this
it sounds like a call for you know
self-determination on the power of
person people and destruction of Israel
okay yes oh yes oh I knew it what you
that furthermore you know the hypocrisy
of arises to heaven I mean yes all of
these are the right things to do it's
it's a hundred times worse in the United
States or in England or in any other
country you talk about why not work it
when I call for that in the United
States but I think that's that's a call
from the Palestinian people and it's not
a call from the Palestinian people it's
a call from groups who call themselves
the Palestinian people I've never seen
in fact it's been hard enough to try to
get the Palestinian people to boycott
settlement produce and the very people
are calling for this you know perfectly
happy to study in Tel Aviv University so
it's not a call from the Palestine
people he's being signed but even if it
were let's say it were a call from the
Palestinian people if I care about the
pellet that any people let's say it's
the Somali people if the Somali people
issue a call do i blindly follow it or
do I ask
is the call is implementing the call
going to help them or hurt them well if
I care about them I'm going to ask the
second question will it help them or
hurt them that's pretty obvious what
this goal will do it's a gift Israeli in
u.s. hardliners they know perfectly well
that there's not going to be an
implementation of the right to return
they can the hypocrisy is so transparent
that they just use it as a weapon to
discredit the entire movement and it's
happened over and over incidentally so
yes if you want to put that if you
really hate the Palestinians it's a good
step because it's going to harm them
predictably
an effect sorry it happened I can give
you examples if you like actually long
before this movement was started
organized I was involved in BDS
activities some of them the right kind
which could be helpful some of them
which I just got into for reasons of
solidarity for the wrong tonight so for
example there was one here right where
we are
Harvard and MIT in 1979 2002 after
Jeanine that's you know before the BDS
movement this one got organized and it
was a pretty good statement it I thought
had just the right things but the Sun
the the people who put it together
insisted on three words which I thought
or a mistake the words were to the
universities and the rest from Israel
now there's a reason why that's a
mistake because of the hypocrisy why not
divest from the United States
first of all every Israeli crime traces
back to the United States and that's a
fragment of Israel of us crimes I'm much
worse you know people say I've read well
us you know Israeli universities don't
condemn the occupation did Harvard and
MIT condemn the invasion of Vietnam no
they took part in it you know I didn't
condemn it they directly took pardon
didn't anybody call for boycotting them
are they calling for boycotting them now
and remember their support for us
support for Israel which is decisive is
a fraction of u.s. crimes and we can say
the same
England and France and on and on so this
four to those particular words could be
attacked and were attacked as pure
anti-semitism unfortunately that was
with justice so the president of Harvard
immediately picked on them and made an
impassioned speech saying we've got to
worry about anti-semitism at Harvard
okay for the next couple of months
the only issue around here was
anti-semitism in Harvard which doesn't
exist
Janene disappeared the Palestinians
disappeared and so on so if you really
want to harm the Palestinians that was a
good proposal I think that for invading
Israel Palestine many times throughout
the last few years I've spoken to people
that are not you know represent sense of
feistiness in society are just
Palestinians living below kneeling and
they told me we like my harvest by
example you know you spin up we know
what we know it might hurt us the
Israeli products are better quality does
it stop it's not we're talking about if
they they're talking about what they
should do now if they want to take
Israeli products
okay that's their choice I'm not saying
they should or they shouldn't it is a
fact however that the Palestinians have
not been able to implement a boycott
even on the settlements let alone on
Israeli products but that's their
problem we're talking about an entirely
different question what should we do
should we take steps which we have every
reason to believe we're going to harm
the Palestinians I don't think so but if
people feel like doing that okay just
join a pack and do it straight out on
the other hand there are very good
BDS proposals very effective ones I've
been in favor of them and in fact
involved in them for years even before
this this alleged movement began there
ones that make sense they target the
occupation first to be a decent tactic
these are tactics not principles a
tactic has to meet at least two
conditions one it has to be helpful to
the victims harmful to them and two it
has to be educational that is it's
directed at some
it's symbolic of course like other
nonviolent actions it's directed at
somebody it's directed an audience it
has to help educate them not miss
educate them so that then they'll be
able to go on and take further actions
that's all point of civil disobedience
okay now what are there are many
proposals that have exactly that effect
so for example those that call for say
and end the u.s. arms sales to Israel
has exactly that effect if symbolic of
course but if implemented yes it would
benefit the Palestinians - it educates
Americans and Europeans who are the
crucial people here that educates them
because it gets them to focus at home
it's really easy to blame the other guy
no look at those awful people in Darfur
and so on it's a little harder to look
into the mirror but that's what counts
look into the mirror find out what we're
doing what we're responsible for what we
can change always crucial and
particularly crucial here because what
we're doing has a decisive influence on
policy so you want to educate people
here to look at home do the hard thing
and pay attention to what's going on
here and try to change it that's what we
can do well if you focus on arms sales
on corporations acting in the operating
the occupied territories on purchase of
goods from the occupied territories and
so on it meets those two criteria on the
other hand if you say let's look at tel
aviv university or let's insist on
boycotting Israel until they end
internal repression anybody with a brain
is just going to laugh I mean there's no
internal repression in the United States
do we boycott Harvard which is a much
worse property so it's gonna laugh it's
going to be a weapon in the hands of
hardliners but I agree that I agree but
I think he said it's a pragmatic
decision it's a lot easier to hurt a
small country like Israel through
boycott then to have this huge Imperial
countries in the u.s. no no it's not
it's quite the opposite it's immediately
understood to be
just saying let's do let's let's go
after something that's easy
not after something that's principled so
therefore it's it's just hypocrisy and
therefore we reject it which is exactly
what happened as in the case that I
mentioned because of the voice and
incidentally if you want to talk about
South Africa let's be serious about it
South Africa the real boycott movement
took off and around 1980 by the time it
took off that was after decades of
educational and organizational work
which had led to a situation in which it
was virtually no support for apartheid I
mean American corporations were
beginning to pull out for their own
reasons at Congress was beginning to
pass the sanctions and so on there's
nothing like that going on in this case
because the work hasn't been done so if
you want the South African analogy do
the work okay then when you get
overwhelming opposition to the Israeli
occupation and US support for it fine
then you can do these things that's it
in fact there's more to the South
African analogy if people would pay
attention to the history around 1960
South African nationalists recognized
that they're becoming a pariah state and
they actually the foreign minister
actually approached the US ambassador
and told him look we know we're being
voted down in the UN and so on and so
forth but you and I know that there's
only one vote at the United Nations
your's
it doesn't matter what the world thinks
or does as long as you support us were
okay and that's turned out to be exactly
correct
exactly through by the 1980s as I said
even Congress was passing sanctions
Reagan had to get around the
Congressional sanctions to keep
supporting South Africa he did as late
as 1988 the u.s. denounced the African
National Congress is one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
Mandela just got off the terrorist list
last year
and if part how it was working fine
looked like they had won everything
they were gloating in their victory a
year or two later Israel US policy
shifted a couple of years after that how
far that was gone now that tells you
that if you're serious about helping the
Palestinians you'll pay attention to the
South African analogy not mythology
about the VDS you can allege movement
before leaving in Europe and a being to
the it's really a movement and a yes and
I've what you're missing is that I've
always supported it even before it
existed when it was properly targeted if
it's targeted in a way which meets the
basic two criteria helping Palestinians
and educational not only that I support
it now I supported it before it began if
it's on the other hand designed to harm
Palestinians and to miss educate people
then I'm not in favor about how could
you if I mean because you're saying
that's not coming from the Palestinian
but one more iteration after I've signed
this call for boycotts
I think it's 170 now inside dice and
there's also a boycott from within in
Israel from Israel so how you know you
have to be saying that a Palestinian
that is just totally irrational
if first of all if Palestinians within
they've tried I mean the leadership at
least has tried to get them to boycott
Israeli settlements and Israeli problems
it's fine that's their business but if
say yes let's take away Palestinians if
Somalis authentically you know organize
Somalis I put forth a call to me which I
can see is going to harm them I'm not
going to follow it at least if I care
about Somalis of course I don't care
about the more following so so again so
let's say really the call was from every
single Palestinian in Israel and
Palestine you you saying that you want
to support them in not harm them but
don't how would they feel if they say to
support us who you do these people you
do something which will harm us what I
would do and what I would do is do what
exactly what I've done for years when
I've talked to Palestinian groups have
been pretty self-destructive I should
say
goes back to the seventies when the peel
I was extremely self-destructive and I
met leadership and others with its AE
the nickel akhmad and other people who
cared about the Palestinians and what we
tried to tell them is look you're
calling for this and you're do acting
this way but you're harming the
Palestinians that's what we tried to
explain it didn't work very well with
the PLO that was dead Saiyans to despair
and allotments but yeah that's exactly
what you do in any case when you're
dealing with oppressed people I mean if
if Black Panthers had said okay let's go
out and smash all the banks I wouldn't
have said well okay you're the black so
therefore I'm going to go smash all the
banks if they had said that which they
didn't I would have said look you're
making a mistake the actions you're
calling for going to harm you and you
should rethink what you're doing if we
care about people that's why we're
activists if there are BDS tactics that
help the Palestinians and help educate
Americans and Europeans so therefore
they will act in ways that matter of
course in favor okay okay
