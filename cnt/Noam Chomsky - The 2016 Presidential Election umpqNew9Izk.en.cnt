his latest book who rules the world so
that's an interesting question for 2016
since the president of united states
occupies a very powerful role in the
world known who do you support well
before answering that let me just make
one comment on elections they're
important it does matter who sits in the
White House who's who appoints Supreme
Court justices who makes decisions about
war and peace about environment and so
on matters who's in Congress matters
who's in the state legislatures and so
on it matters but it's not the main
issue we are kind of indoctrinated here
into focusing all of our attention on
energy on where what button we push on
in in November every couple of years
which is not insignificant but not the
main issue the main issue what is what
are the forces domestic forces that are
pressuring acting to determine the kind
of choices that will be made legislation
will be passed and so on now of course
there's one force that's always going to
be there
private concentrated capital corporate
power lobbyists as corporate lawyers and
so on writing legislations
so they're always funding the elections
they'll always be there the question is
is there going to be a countervailing
force is there going to be a force
representing popular interests needs and
concerns defending themselves against
what in fact is a standard class-based
assault against them now elections can
be used as a way of galvanizing and
mobilizing the kinds of groups which
will could become persistent
dedicated growing constant forces that
influence significantly what's done in
the White House and Congress the New
Deal legislation of Roosevelt for
example wouldn't have been passed it
wouldn't have even been initiated
without militant labor action and other
political action can't wait and that
those are lessons to remember but now
going back to who should you push the
button for well my own in the primaries
I would prefer Bernie Sanders if Clinton
is nominated and it comes to a choice
between Clinton and Trump in a swing
state a state where it's not a matter
which way you vote I would hold I would
vote against Trump
and by elementary arithmetic that means
you hold your nose and you vote Democrat
I don't think there's any other rational
choice abstaining from voting or say
voting for say a candidate you prefer a
minority candidate it just amounts to a
vote for Donald Trump which i think is a
devastating prospect for reasons I've
already mentioned so but meanwhile do
the important things the significance of
the Senators campaign that which is
pretty remarkable I think it certainly
surprised me it's it's not radical in
Sanders himself is pretty much a
traditional New Deal Democrat I don't
say that in criticism that doesn't
pretend to be anything else and that's a
breath of fresh air in the current
generally right-wing climate but the
importance of it is if it can be used
these energy and enthusiasm that's been
organized and mobilized can be used to
develop an ongoing popular movement
which will be a powerful force no matter
who's in office to influence and direct
the country in ways that are
absolutely necessary even for survival
at this point that's my view of it
