or that's because he smoke four packs of
unfiltered cigarettes a day but my
grandmother has just celebrated her 100
and 7th birthday so we anyway at the end
of this program I thought it went pretty
well and a cameramen gave me a thumbs up
sign went back to be AI and we knew it
would air in two days and the two days
passed and the show didn't air and I
people were calling and I called the
show I said what's up and they said
there was a problem with the sinking of
the video and the soundtracks and I
thought of that cameraman giving me the
thumbs up sign he didn't seem very
concerned he said how did you learn this
and they said from two stations
Minneapolis in Chicago called and said
they couldn't use it so I said huh and
they said we'll have you back another
time said right you know you can't
because dr. Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn was
about to be court-martialed in fact she
served in the brig she was jailed for a
year and a half her husband raising
their three small children alone the
other day we were in st. Louis and I was
giving a talk and afterwards a young man
came up and said would you sign my book
I said yeah who do I rate it too and he
said my name is emiliano Hewitt Vaughn
and he was Yolanda son and so obviously
the show was not going to take place
again so I called these two stations in
Chicago and Minneapolis and I asked for
the operations director and said what's
up and they said odd you should ask
since we haven't aired it but I show
there was a concern viewer and they said
that Sally Jessy Raphael show had
recalled it from New York so I called
back the show and I said the jig's up
I'd like to speak to the executive
producer and they said he's a very busy
man so people were just inundating us
when's the show going to happen I said
don't call us call the Sally Jessy
Raphael show and I guess they got a
bunch of calls no I guess they got a lot
a lot of calls maybe hundreds I don't
know maybe thousands all I know is at
two days later I got a call from a
frantic high-level producer who said the
executive producer would like to talk to
you I said I'm a very busy woman
and they asked if I would cry censorship
if they edited the program I said of
course not I'm an editor to you have a
right it's your show I assume you'll
edit out Sally's fit and they did they
did but the show round the next day
because they held it at round with
headlines that said things get messy
with Sally Jessy but the most
interesting response I got and this is I
think something we learn more and more
how important media activism is it would
never have aired if it weren't for all
the people who made this show happen the
most interesting response was from women
on southern military bases who called up
to say we've never heard this view
before on television and we agree with
you we only whisper it around here they
said we can't have these debates on
military bases we rely on you in
civilian society and that's what the
media is supposed to be here for for
serving a Democratic Society sort of
like a large national kitchen table that
we all sit around and debate and discuss
the most important issues of the day war
and peace life and death and anything
less than that is a disservice to the
servicemen and women of this country yes
your activism can make an enormous
difference we are living in very dire
times right now time with the leading up
to the invasion of Iraq where we have a
media that is iced out almost all
dissent you look at the week leading up
to colin powell giving an address at the
UN Security Council pushing for war in
the week after this was februari 5th
2003 fairness and accuracy in reporting
the media watch group in New York did a
study of those two weeks of the four
major nightly newscasts NBC CBS ABC and
PBS newshour with jim lehrer on those
two weeks of broadcasts there were 393
interviews done around war three were
with anti-war representatives three of
almost 400 at a most critical time now
that you can't even call mainstream
media
that is an extremist media and it
doesn't reflect mainstream America
because at that time most people were
opposed to the invasion they were for
more inspections and diplomacy that is a
media beating the drums for war and that
has got to be changed and then you look
at how the media covered the invasion
just a few small examples the night
march 19th that the bombs started to
fall dan Rather said good morning
Baghdad and then you had Tom Brokaw of
NBC saying we don't want to destroy the
infrastructure of Iraq because we're
going to own that country in a few days
and then you had the network's not just
fox but MSNBC NBC CNN all adopting the
name that the Pentagon had carefully
researched for its propagandistic value
Operation Iraqi Freedom actually they
come up with another name before
Operation Iraqi liberation but they
couldn't use it thus according to
counterpunch org because the acronym oh
I L so they came up with Operation Iraqi
Freedom and you expect that that's the
Pentagon but for the network's to use
the Pentagon's name as the title of
their own coverage you really have to
ask if we had state media in this
country how would it be any different
right now the invasion the occupation it
is so dire in Fallujah the minarets
being blown up and the US military
saying well it wasn't at least it wasn't
the mosque in the city of mosques the
minarets so symbolic it's where the call
to prayer emanates from so significant
for Muslims all over the world and what
about the people who are dying the US
military says it's insurgents who are
dying yet the doctors and nurses in the
hospital saying no it's hundreds women
and children I mean when you have these
c150 gun
ships that are strafing and bombing the
whole city do you think they can pick
out the insurgents from the kids and you
have a country now George Bush has
managed to do something Saddam Hussein
has never managed to do and that is
unite the Sunnis and the Shia and now
the Sufi clerics the most a political in
Iraq have called for their followers to
join the resistance we know how many US
soldiers have died and it is horrific
more than 700 we don't know how many
Iraqi civilians have died more than
10,000 we believe and also the injured
more than 18,000 US soldiers have been
medically evacuated from Iraq we don't
hear these numbers but the civilians the
Iraqi civilians whose numbers we don't
know whose names we don't know this was
the country these were the people that
the US administration said we went in to
save and to liberate it matters and it
matters to the whole world this week the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee is
holding hearings on John Negroponte to
replace Paul Bremer as US ambassador to
Iraq John Negroponte a what's
interesting is you're hardly going to
hear and anything about this in the
media because of how the media works the
media reflects the establishment
consensus that is set by the Democrats
and Republicans the media reflects the
establishment consensus before the
invasion
before why doesn't this happen when
President Bush hold the news huh um
before before the invasion the Democrats
agreed with the Republicans right let's
not forget John Kerry John Edwards they
voted for the invasion of Iraq now the
Democrats are trying to distinguish
themselves and so there is more debate
and that's what the media reflects it's
not that the media has gotten any better
it's that as they follow the
establishment in Washington there is a
little more of a division and that's
what they're reflecting not so on Johnny
aponte people like Christopher Dodd who
objected to him being named US
ambassador to the United Nations now
says that he supports John Negroponte a
John Negroponte a US ambassador ton
Duras 1981 to 1985 this was the staging
ground for the illegal control or
thousands of Nicaraguans killed at this
time yes in Honduras alone the CIA back
trained battalion 316 also responsible
for the deaths of many Hondurans one
high level state Department officials
said in 1982 when he was preparing the
state department report on Honduras that
John Negroponte a personally made him
purged from it any reference to
disappearances and murders any
references to death squads in Honduras
we have continually this week had on the
air nuns and priests talking about their
personal appeals to Honduran Ambassador
John Negroponte at the time for the
missing and the disappeared in Honduras
and now this is the man who will most
likely be soon approved to be the next
US ambassador to Iraq who
will preside over the largest embassy in
the world the largest US embassy in the
world three thousand people 500 CIA in
Iraq he will be in charge of counter
insurgency to give us a picture of what
is to come but now that the Democrats
have said they will raise no objection
you know that the media will also not go
back and look at the record we need a
media that gives us history that gives
us context that gives us truth I just
have a few minutes and I am very eager
to hear what Nome has to say and so I
want to end with a story that well I
first heard about because Noam Chomsky
never let this story die and that is
what happened to the people of East
Timor and the lesson it provides for all
of us known wrote about it from way back
December 1975 Indonesia invaded East
Timor killed indonesia invaded East
Timor ninety percent of the weapons use
or from the United States Henry
Kissinger and gerald ford the president
then went to Indonesia met with su carto
the long-reigning dictator and gave the
go-ahead for the invasion what happened
after that well the first days extremely
bloody thousands of to marie's killed
and his Kissinger came back to the
United States he was getting cables from
high-level state Department officials
saying we've got to watch out because
Congress will cut off military aid to
Indonesia when he came back to United
States he held a high-level meeting with
state Department officials castigating
them for leaving a paper trail saying we
will not kick our ally in the teeth the
note taker for that meeting Jerry Bremer
the nickname for el Paul Bremer yes he
learned well at his master's knee it
does matter that we document what
happens so that history doesn't repeat
itself as we see it happening today and
so the Indonesian military killed off
the people of Timor closing off the
country to the outside world in 1990 and
91 my colleague Ellen Erin and I got a
chance to go to East Timor and in 91 we
in 90 first saw this hell on earth that
is the Indonesian military dictatorship
in in Timor in 91 we went back because
the UN had finally brokered agreement
that would allow a fact-finding mission
to go and investigate the human rights
situation and we wanted to see what
would happen when this delegation came
which never did because we later learned
the u.s. didn't want this delegation to
come on November 12 1991 we followed a
procession of to marie's thousands of
them from a church to a cemetery the
Santa Cruz cemetery they were protesting
yet another killing of at emory's young
men and they carried banners girls took
them out of their Catholic school
blouses that said why the Indonesian
military shoot our church old women in
traditional to marie's garb boys and
their Catholic school shorts marched
through the streets through this
geography of pain every other building a
police barracks or military headquarters
or even a hotel where Tim Ariz were
disappeared or tortured at the back and
they walk through the streets until they
got to the cemetery when they got there
we talked to people why are you doing
this and everyone said the same thing
for my father for my mother for my
village it was wiped out and then we saw
from the direction the procession had
come hundreds of Indonesian soldiers
carrying their us m16s at the ready
position the people were horrified the
soldiers were marching up 12 to 15 of
breasts they couldn't escape because
there were walls on either side of the
road Alan suggested we walked to the
front of the crowd because although we
knew that the Indonesian military had
committed these massacres in the past
they've never done it in front of
Western journalists and me we thought
maybe we could head off the attack this
time though I took out my equipment
because we'd always hidden it in the
past so as not to endanger the Tim Ruiz
if they were caught talking to western
journalists I put the headphones on my
microphone above my head Alan put the
camera above his head and we walked to
the front of the crowd soldiers marched
