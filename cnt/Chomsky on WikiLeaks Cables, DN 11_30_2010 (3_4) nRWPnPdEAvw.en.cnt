Mimi Goodman our guest is noam chomsky
world-renowned dissident author of more
than a hundred books speaking to us from
Boston no you wrote a piece after the
midterm elections called outrage
misguided I want to read for you now
what Sarah Palin tweeted the former
Alaska governor of course Republican
vice presidential nominee this is what
she tweeted about WikiLeaks she rather
she put it on Facebook she said first
and foremost what steps were taken to
stop WikiLeaks director Julian Assange
from distributing this highly sensitive
classified material especially after
he'd already published material not once
but twice in the previous months Assange
is not a journalist any more than the
editor of al-qaeda's new english
language magazine inspire as a
journalist he's an anti-american
operative with blood on his hands his
past posting of classified documents
revealed the identity of more than a
hundred afghan sources to the Taliban
why was he not pursued with the same
urgency we pursue al-qaeda and Taliban
leaders Noam Chomsky your response
that's pretty much what i would expect
sarah palin to say i don't know how much
he understands but i think we should pay
attention to what we learn from the from
the leaks what we learn for example is
kinds of things I've said the most
perhaps the most dramatic revelation is
the wherever he mentioned the bitter
hatred of democracy that is revealed
both by the US government Hillary
Clinton others and also by the
Diplomatic Service to tell the world to
tell them their talk to each other to
pretend to each other that the Arab
world is regards Iran as the major
threat and once the u.s. to bomb Iran is
extremely revealing when they know that
approximately eighty percent of Arab
opinion regards the US and Israel is the
major threat ten percent regard Iran is
the major threat and a majority 57% I
think the region would be better off
with a
any nuclear weapons as a kind of
deterrent that doesn't even enter all
that enters is what they claim has been
said by our dictators brutal Arab
dictators that's what counts with a how
representative this is of what they say
we don't know because we don't know what
the filtering is but that's a minor
point the major point is that the
population is irrelevant all that
matters is the opinions of the dictators
that we support and if they were to back
us that's the Arab world that's a very
revealing picture of the mentality of a
US political leadership and presumably
elite opinion judging by the commentary
that's appeared here that's the way it's
been presented in the press as well and
your piece matter what the Arabs believe
your piece outrage misguided back to the
midterm elections and what we're going
to see now can you talk about the Tea
Party movement well the Tea Party
movement itself is maybe fifteen twenty
percent of the electorate it's
relatively affluent white nativist you
know it has traditional nativist streaks
to it but what is much more important I
think is the is its outreach I mean over
half the population says they more or
less supported their support its message
and what people are thinking is
extremely interesting I mean the
overwhelmingly polls revealed that
people are extremely bitter angry
hostile opposed to everything the
primary cause undoubtedly is the
economic disaster it's it's not just the
financial catastrophe it's an economic
disaster I mean manufacturing industry
for example the unemployment levels are
the level the Great Depression and
unlike the Great Depression those jobs
are not coming
us owners and managers have long ago
made the decision that they can make
more profit with complicated financial
deals than by production so finance this
goes back to the 70s mainly Reagan
escalated in onward Clinton to the
economy's been financialized financial
institutions have grown enormously and
their share of corporate profits it may
be something like a third or something
like that today at the same time
correspondingly production has been
exported so you buy a some electronic
device from China China is an assembly
plant for a Northeast Asian a production
center the parts and components come
from the word advanced countries and
from the United States and the
technology so yes that's a cheap place
to assemble things so I'm back here and
ends rather similar in Mexico Vietnam
Vietnam and so on that's the way to make
profits it destroys the society here but
that's not the concern of the of the
ownership class and the managerial class
their concern is profit that's what
drives the economy and the rest of it is
a fallout people are extremely bitter
about it but don't seem to understand it
so the same people who are majority who
say that Wall Street is to blame for the
current crisis our voting Republican the
both parties are deep in the pockets of
Wall Street but the Republicans much
more so than the Democrats and the same
is true on issue after issue so people
that the antagonism to everyone is
extremely high actually antagonisms they
don't like the population doesn't like
democrats but they hate republicans even
more
they're against big business they're
against government we only have 30
seconds to science no we only have 30
seconds I wanted to ask if you were
President Obama's top advisor what would
you tell him to do right now I would
tell him to do what FDR did when big
business was opposed to him or helped
organize stimulate public opposition and
put through a serious populist program
which can be done stimulate the economy
don't give away everything to defend its
ears push through a real health reform
the health reform of those pushed
through maybe a slight improvement but
it leaves the major problem untouched if
you're worried about the deficit pay
attention to the fact that it's almost
all attributable to the military
spending and we're going to leave it
there but we'll continue the
conversation after and posted online at
democracynow.org I'm Amy Goodman thanks
so much for joining us
