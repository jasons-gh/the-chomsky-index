it if Israel were to say you would be
allowed in would you go if they will say
that I can just go in a normal fashion I
don't want their authorization if they
can say that I can go in in a normal
fashion as when I visit Israel or any
other country yes I'll go we're talking
to Noam Chomsky who's been well what
exactly did they stamp your passport
let's see what did they stamp it but
actually my daughter is getting it so I
could see it just one second it's it as
Allenby border control date two red
lines across it then it says entry and
the same in Hebrew other staff says
entry denied my Vyasa tea is that the
word entry is misspelled and you say
this was in constant consultation with
the Ministry of the Interior you know
the the interrogator my impression was
that he was sort of apologetic and just
transmitting information he was
receiving regularly he was in direct
contact with them but he's in now you
said you are gonna deliver this lecture
but by video conference tomorrow it's
set up by video conference from my mom
where I um no um I wanted to ask you a
question on Iran this latest deal that
has just been announced I don't know if
you've been following the news as as you
have been there but a deal on on the
whole issue of nuclear power and nuclear
weapons Iran has agreed to ship most of
its enriched uranium to Turkey and a
nuclear fuel swap deal that could ease
the international standoff over Iran's
disputed nuclear program in exchange Ron
will receive low-level nuclear fuel to
run a medical reactor the deal reached
with the foreign ministers of Iran
Turkey and Brazil and Iran said the swap
will be under the supervision of the UN
nuclear agency the IAEA the
International Atomic Energy Agency what
is your assessment of this if the
reports are accurate it's hard to see
why on what grounds the United States
jack is basically us objections but
what's significant about this are
several things first that is Iran its
Brazil and Turkey Turkey's
representative of the regional powers a
turkey like the Arab League has made it
clear that it does not it does not want
sanction so once a negotiation
diplomatic settlement Brazil is probably
the most respected country the on the
non line countries plays very important
role in fact the two of them have
happened that they had to be on the
Security Council but that they're openly
calling for a peaceful diplomatic
settlement and opposing the equal to the
threat of any further actions of that
significant also significant is this
that this is in a way a side issue and
there is a way to approach it the whole
issue was whatever threat there may be
in the middle east from the clear
weapons and that's to move towards a
nuclear weapons-free zone in the region
now back in nineteen ninety five of the
united states agreed to that it was on
the insistence egypt this was the review
conference regular review conference and
egypt other in online country said that
they would not continue with the
non-proliferation treaty unless the west
meaning the united states agreed to move
towards a nuclear weapons-free zone in
the region which would
to eliminate a threat there may be yours
mitigate any threat there with might be
but we're reference and the US didn't
formally agree to that I treaty wasn't
even more committed now than it was then
he us when the US Britain invaded Iraq
they didn't try to present a ton of its
in legal cover as you recall the claim
was that Iraq was in violation of a
Security Council resolution resolution
1991 the calling on it to terminate its
development of weapons of mass
destruction well we know it happened to
the pre tapes but what's important is
that same with his illusion has a
provision an article which commits the
signers to establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East so
the US and Britain have a special
commitment to this beyond the general
commitment of the nuclear review foul
well well Egypt is which is another head
of the nonviolent movement 118 countries
has pressed that very strong in the last
few weeks at meetings the prepared
during meetings at the review meetings
and the US has in a position where has
formally agreed but it has evaded the
agreement by saying clearly that no such
resolution will apply to Israel and
accepting the Israeli position that
explicitly that while this might be good
idea is where we can put it this is not
the proper time because first we have to
have a comprehensive peace agreement in
the Middle East well you know a
comprehensive peace agreement is off
indefinitely as long as the US and
Israel reject the very broad
international consensus on a two-state
settlement so that's essentially saying
well we're not going to proceed with
this and if they're not going to proceed
with it
there can't be a nuclear weapons-free
zone those are much more central issues
and it's also worth emphasizing that
both the Security Council and the
International Energy Agency have
explicitly called upon Israel to join
the non-proliferation treaty in to open
its facilities to inspection and that
happened last fall and the Obama
administration immediately informed
Israel it could disregard the
International Agency insist request
India as well with Security Council
resolution would also applied to India
but the Obama administration informed
the Indians that they could ignore it
they're developing nuclear weapons with
the indirect US assistance under an
Anglo hunt that but in Indian at the MER
treaty known we have to break for 60
seconds and I wanted to come back to
this discussion Noam Chomsky professor
at MIT has been banned along with his
daughter professor Aviva Chomsky from
entering the West Bank where he was
going to deliver two lectures at birzeit
university he was borrowed on the
Allenby bridge border crossing from
Jordan into the West Bank this is
democracy now we'll be back in a minute
