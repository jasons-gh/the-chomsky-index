one of the dangers of TTIP they're
pretty extreme in fact Greenpeace a
couple of days ago released 280 pages of
internal documents on this so-called
trade agreement and they spell out
details of what all of us should know
the so-called free trade agreements are
not free trade agreements in fact to a
large extent they're not even trade
agreements these are investor write
agreements there's a reason why they're
kept secret from the public and as soon
as you look at them you see why notice I
say secret from the public not secret
they're not kept secret they're not
secret to the corporate lawyers and
lobbyists who are writing the detailed
regulations of course in the interests
of their constituents not doesn't happen
to be the public of the world of their
own countries so these are highly
protectionist for the benefit of private
power so-called intellectual property
rights raised effectively raised tariffs
they're called patents but very which
have an enormous impact on economies
great wonderful for pharmaceutical and
media conglomerates and others the the
right for the the investors corporations
are given the right to sue governments
something you and I can't do but a
corporation can to sue governments for
harming their future potentially future
profits you can figure out what that
means in such cases already in the
courts for they're not in the courts
they go to private trade adjudication
groups made up largely of corporate
representatives they're already going on
with NAFTA and we can expect more of
them there are provisions that undermine
efforts at regulation in
incidentally regulation of environmental
of the dangers and rather strikingly the
phrase climate change does not appear in
these 280 pages which are illustrative
of the whole structure so these that
they have almost no I should say these
these agreements so-called Pacific and
Atlantic have virtually no effect on
tariffs tariffs are already quite low
among the major trading partners when
you read the propaganda about it it says
oh yes or Viet Nam's gonna have to lower
its tariffs yeah almost no effect on
trade the major trading partners have
already have agreements that have
reduced tariffs very substantially there
are few exceptions not many so these are
basically should disabuse ourselves of
the illusion that these are free trade
agreements anything but and to a large
extent not even trade agreements we have
the experience of others like NAFTA many
years of experience so it takes a NAFTA
it has all of the aspects that I just
described but even more consider even
what is called trade interactions across
the us-mexico border
they've increased substantially since
NAFTA so economists will tell you trade
has greatly increased but have a look at
them so for example suppose that General
Motors produces parts and Indiana sends
them to Mexico to for assembly and sells
the car in Los Angeles
that's called trade in both directions
but it's not it's interactions internal
to a command economy it's as if during
the days of the Soviet Union parts were
bade saying Leningrad sent the Warsaw
for assembly and sold in Moscow that we
wouldn't call that trade
that's interactions internal to a
command economy
