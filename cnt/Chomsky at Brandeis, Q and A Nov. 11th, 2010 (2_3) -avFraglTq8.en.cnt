hi my name is John you had some unkind
words earlier for the state of
scholarship a nameless in particular in
the last 10-15 years has been a growing
we do legitimization and I guess salt on
academic freedom particularly um that's
all I'm academic freedom Oh tax
initially honor Middle East Studies
young scholars of Islam and generally
she's covers so comment on that and
possibilities for people he had a
backpack so the issue is the attack on
academic freedom especially in with
relate to us to Middle East Studies yeah
that's real I'm not sure how new it is
frankly it's been going on for a long
time the so middle east studies for
example is quite different from say
latin american studies that compare the
two professional associations in the
case of the Latin American Studies
Association typically when the u.s.
carries out atrocity somewhere or invade
some country or whatever what the press
does is go to the local university and
get an expert who can be confidently
assumed to preach the government line
okay that's for example it mostly
happened in Vietnam happens in Israel
all the time easy Latin America do it
when us tras ities began to mount and
Latin America through the 60s ending up
with
our stories in the 80s the Latin
American Studies Association would not
provide the ideological support I'm in a
few did but most did in fact they
condemned the actions that people who
really cared about the countries where
they work so the media had to invent a
new cadre of apologists couldn't go to
the local university because his details
if you like but they picked a series of
people who became you know where were
designated to be sexperts and nothing
there and they gave the official line so
then the press could appear to be
neutral they're just going to expert
Middle East Studies never been a problem
you can always get Bernard Lewis the
rest of them you can turn to the
Washington Institute of Near East policy
it's an offshoot of a pact which the
press pretends they know better is a
independent scholarly agency and so on
and so forth it's been there for a long
time there are also now now that don't
say see it's not exactly what happened
with South Africa but their similarities
and now that popular opinion is very
notably turning against Israeli crimes
not against us Israeli crimes because
that aspect is suppressed but it could
be that but what they're turning against
Israeli crimes there's a growth of
organizations trying to beat it back and
announce it and condemn it like the
David project for example and others
their goal is to try to suppress any
discussion of these issues you couldn't
do that in the case of South Africa
because there was no support for a part
of it you know you couldn't maybe you
could do it in the John Birch Society or
something but in major sectors there was
essentially no support for apartheid in
this case it hasn't gone that far by any
means but opposition is growing notably
I mean look I've given talks on this
topic and Brandeis for many years back
in the 90s when I tried to give a talk
on this issue the meeting was just
broken up literally you know students
who get up and scream have to stop the
meeting in fact I remember one hook have
been 95 or so when I was talking about
these issues but the protests were so
violent than the I had one friend who
was in the back of the room and Israeli
actually served in the Israeli army and
so on he tried to break up the he was
called on to ask a question and he tried
to sort of turn it back to something
sensible so he asked a sensible question
but the audience started screaming at
him you know Bo gay you know traitor you
know you can't do that you gotta scream
and have tantrums that was in the
mid-90s I remember another talk a couple
of years ago where within that bad but
there was literally airport security you
couldn't get into the auditorium without
opening your bag
pocketbook backpack whatever it might be
and getting inspected well today you
know some people walked out it's it's a
big change and that changes all over the
country I'm either I might give you
details well I me so literally have
police protection at major American
universities if I was giving a talk on
this issue that's I know half the cops
in Cambridge ghostly had to come to the
meeting sense but that's that's all gone
and it's a sign of the substantial
change in attitudes in fact it by now
it's extremely hard to get a hostile
question it used to be impossible to get
anything but diatribes well okay with
with that change which is very visible
there's an attempt to beat it back and
that's I think what you're talking about
just partially it's been successful that
not too much actually there are few
cases which are deplorable but by and
large I think it's been held in check
hi I'm Jason Olson studies sure I've
heard a lot of things about you but I
was I was very relieved to know that
you're correct about under the Interfax
11 question comment that I wanted to
close two and two I know you have had a
chance to explore it much but on
Christian Zionism ice there's two trends
you're right about this Christian
apocalyptic side there's also Christian
humanistic Zionism which comes with
historical guilt stemming from Christian
anti-semitism there is you know juices
chosen people wanting to support Israel
to prevent Jewish deaths and I'd like to
I want to know if you've explored
Christian humanistic Zionism and how you
see it as a role in helping the peace
process well who did you have in mind
specifically there's there's pockets of
their projects other yeah I mature it is
a garnish know that sure there's when
you talk about the rise of
fundamentalism say Islamic
fundamentalism you can say the same
thing there are pockets of it that have
a humanistic origin and drive but if you
look at the general phenomenon I think
as a what I said is a pretty good first
approximation and it also reaches all
the ways a high places like to the
president's to the White House I don't
know how many of you know this but the
George W Bush was part of this
in this in January 2003 when Bush was
trying to get support from Western
powers for the invasion of Iraq he met
with the French president sure act and
he started he totally started what sure
act took to be raving about they started
citing passages in Ezekiel very obscure
passages which nobody understands
there's a passage in Ezekiel about
goguen Magog you know coming from the
north and doing terrible things nobody
knows whether goga and Magog or people
or places or what they are but they play
a role in sort of this Christian you
know the eschatology the way I found out
about this was from a Belgian theologian
who sent me a disquisition that he wrote
on this passage from Ezekiel with a
message saying he had sent it to the
French government and I saw her worked
it out that's been verified biographies
of sure act and so on what happened as
sharik didn't understand what this
maniac was talking about so he asked the
Foreign Office the others eight you know
what was his guy raving about and they
didn't have any idea so they approached
this Belgian theologian on Belgian
theologian who gave him a long
description of you know the passage and
what it's meant and ultra right you know
extremist Christian fought and so on but
which evidently believed and in fact if
you go back to Reagan his handlers kept
in pre-law under control but in the
cases where he got off by himself he
started talking about these things I
mean I think this is you know how
serious is I don't know but it's it's a
big part of American culture and it's
very very effective I'm there is
Christian humanism certainly but I don't
think I think Christian humanism is envy
you now you find it say in the National
Council of Bishops who were critical of
the US Israeli policies that's Christian
humanism I mean the idea that it support
Israel to save Jews is very strange
because the Israeli government doesn't
try to save Jews I was pointing out that
they follow policies which prefer
expansion to security now they're not
unique in that that's pretty common
among states and mythology is states you
don't want to protect their citizens
certainly not true I mean takes a the
invasion of Iraq I mean the aration of
the Iraq was undertaken with the
expectation that was going to increase
terror that was what the intelligence
agency said both British and American
that's what specialist said and so on
and it happened much more than was
expected in fact her increased by a
factor of seven after the invasion of
Iraq way beyond what was expected but
that's pretty typical of state behavior
and Israel is no exception and if you
look I mean they could have security
right now you know you want to save Jews
fine except the international consensus
not security everybody agrees but that's
not state behavior and I think the I if
there are groups that think they're
helping save Jews by supporting Israeli
policies I think they're pretty
misguided they look at the history and
the current situation but yes you're
right there there I don't think they're
the major force I should say there are
other reasons to explore if we're
serious about it about why you have
better support for Israel and a lot of
these regions are not very pretty there
are reasons having to do with you know
strategic analysis and so on and so
forth but I think one fundamental reason
which I don't think has been explore it
much is that the United States is a
settler colonial society settler
colonial societies are absolutely the
worst form of imperialism because it
means you wipe out the indigenous
population I mean you know there were
people living here before the colonists
came from England they're gone and they
were gone because that was the will of
God there's a streak of what's called
providential ISM which runs right
through American history from the
founding fathers right up till today
which says whatever we do it's God's
will and it could run through the
details they're interesting but this
says when the colonists came they came
in order to help the Indians by
exterminating them and then you get
commentary you know buddy Supreme Court
justices and people that is kind of
strange we came here to help them but
they're withering away like the leaves
of autumn you know well God's ways are
mysterious if we can this is a deep
streak of American history and they many
people just intuitively see Israel is
reliving it and that's intensified by
the fact that you remember the United
States was settled by religious
extremists these were people who were
waving the holy book while they were
calling themselves the children of
Israel
you know coming to the promised land and
you have to exterminate the Amalekites
you know that goes right from the
beginning of American history right up
to the present and I don't know how to
measure exactly but I suspect that
that's part of the sort of cultural
background for intuitive support not
pretty but the imperial conquest never
is and settler colonialism is the worst
