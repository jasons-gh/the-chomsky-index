when Russia invaded Afghanistan we
didn't ask what's the best option for
Russia the best option for them is to
get out you know they have no right
being there so the best options to get
out when saddam hussein invaded kuwait
we didn't ask what's the best option
like how should he deal with that but
when the west invades another country
all the values shift the only question
that arises is what's best for the
aggressors well that's interesting you
know it's a sign of the deeply rooted
imperial mentality which of course goes
back centuries and virtually dominates
the intellectual and moral cultures but
in the case of iraq we should recognize
principles that we automatically accept
when someone else is guilty of a crime
aggressors simply have no rights they
have responsibilities but no rights the
primary responsibility is holds of
written in the United States is to pay
massive reparations for the crimes that
they've committed that includes the
invasion of course it includes the
murderous sanctions regime the directors
of the UN oil-for-food programme
distinguished international diplomats
both resigned because they regarded it
as genocide it includes support for
Saddam Hussein through his worst
atrocities long after the end of the war
with Iran in fact even after the first
Gulf War when President Bush the first
authorized Saddam to crush the rebellion
general rebellions that probably would
have overthrown it well massive
reparations are certainly called for
second responsibilities to hold the
guilty accountable and the third
responsibilities pay attention to the
voices of the victims and we have a
pretty good sense of what they are
doesn't enter into debate so if you look
at the presidential debates or the
discussion of the options that one voice
is missing Iraqis and it's not that the
voice is not hurt
the Pentagon and December released its
latest study of focus groups all around
Iraq and it presented its report as an
optimistic report it said there's good
news Iraqis have shared beliefs so
there's hope for reconciliation contrary
to what is said by people who think that
the sectarian violence is out of control
and look down and see what the shared
beliefs are the shared beliefs are that
the United States is responsible for the
sectarian violence and the other crimes
and that the invaders ought to pull out
and leave the country for the Iraqis
that's the shared beliefs that's the
good news well that position does not
enter into discussion in the West it's
reported let's forgotten this doesn't
matter we run the world we own the world
we decide what's best I can have my own
opinion of what we ought to do others
can have their own equally uninformed
opinions including the CIA and military
intelligence but what matters is what
Iraqis one and we should give them the
opportunity to construct policy by
Iraqis I do not mean the government that
is established in the highly protected
heavily protected us run Green Zone yeah
it's there but that's not the voice of
Iraqis any more than the government that
the Russians said we're protecting and
Kabul in the 1980s was the ways of
Afghans so those are the
responsibilities from then on we have to
follow those obligations I don't think
there's any good solution for Iraq at
this point the United States says it's
kind of interesting to see that although
Americans and Europeans do not accept
the principles that they profess Iraqis
do when Iraqis accuse attribute
responsibility to the invaders for the
murderers sectarian violence
they're simply following the principles
of the Nuremberg Tribunal the nor I've
you know quite explicitly defined
aggression in terms which of course
trivially apply to the u.s. british
invasion of iraq and went on to say that
aggression is the supreme international
crime differing from other war crimes in
that it encompasses all of the evil that
follows well in the case of iraq that
means it encompasses the sectarian
murderous sectarian warfare the ethnic
cleansing and so on and Iraqis accept
that they accept the Nuremberg
principles as the Pentagon study shows
Americans and Europeans don't accept
that we don't accept that we are that we
the aggressors are responsible for all
the evil that follows and again as a
reflection of the Imperial mentality we
can profess principles that they only
apply to others not to us we should live
up to those principles should mention
finally that the chief prosecutor at
Nuremberg Justice Robert Jackson
American prosecutor had some eloquent
words that he addressed to the tribunal
he said we are handing this of course is
the tribunal that tried the the worst
Nazi war criminals it said we are
handing these defendants of poison
chalice and if we sit from it if we were
ever guilty of similar crimes we must
accept the same judgment or else we are
declaring the trial to be a farce well
European and American opinion tacitly is
that the trials were forced it's not the
first time Iraqis a pair maybe probably
don't know it but they're the in fact
are accepting the Nuremberg principles
we should think about the possibility of
living up to our own professed ideals
which means applying them to ourselves
it could be a very different world if we
did that same would be true about let's
let's take the next it with regard to
Iraq Iraqis just
knowledgeable correspondence likes a
near rosen who's followed it very
closely from the beginning they often
describe the American British Invasion
as comparable to the Mongol invasions of
the 13th century it's not clear that
there is any solution for Iraq the only
question is what's the least worst
solution at this point that nobody has a
positive proposal as to what to do but
it's up to Iraqis to determine it
