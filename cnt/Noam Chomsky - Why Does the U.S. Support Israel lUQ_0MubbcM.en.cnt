Why does America support Israel? Well, there is a history for this. 
It is an interesting history 
That is really a long time 
There is something to remember 
Zionist Christianity is a powerful force 
It appeared long before Jewish Zionism 
In England specifically Christian Zionism was 
Influential power among Britain's allies 
It is one of the motives for the Balfour Declaration 
One of the motives for British support 
For Jewish colonialism in the name of Israel, remember 
The Bible said so 
This is a large part of 
Elite culture in Britain, as well as in the United States of America 
And Drew Wilson was 
A committed Christian reads the Bible every day 
So are Harry Truman 
Harold Ikes a senior Roosevelt administration official once described 
The return of the Jews to Palestine with the greatest event in history. 
It is the fulfillment of what is mentioned in the Bible 
These countries are deeply religious 
You take literally what was mentioned in the Bible, and this is also part of colonialism 
This is the last stage of European colonialism 
Note that the states 
The strongest in its support for Israel is not just the United States of America. 
It is the United States of America, Australia and Canada 
The branches of England, which are sometimes called "the English" 
Unusual forms of imperialism 
They are colonial societies 
Colonial societies, ... not like India, ... not like the British colonization of India 
It is somewhat closer to South Africa or to Algeria under French colonialism 
Colonial societies are the kind where the colonizer comes 
To remove the original people 
Also driven by 
Religious principles, very religious groups driven by Christian Zionism. These are major cultural factors 
There are also important geo-strategic factors ... going back to 1948, for example 
There was a difference between the State Department and the Pentagon in the USA 
On how the deal with the new state of Israel should be 
The State Department was 
Reluctant ... was not very committed to the Israeli occupation 
To create the state of Israel, and was concerned about refugees. 
She wanted a practical solution to the refugee problem 
But the Pentagon in return 
Reckitt was very impressed by the Israeli military 
Israeli military successes 
When referring to the internal reports that were declassified, former chiefs of war staff describe 
Israel as the second most powerful army in the region after Turkey 
And it is the expected base of the American army in the region. This text has a rest 
I cannot view the full report now 
But in 1958 when there was a serious crisis in the region 
Israel was the only country that cooperated strongly with Britain and the United States of America 
In return, it received significant government and military support. 
1967 The year in which relations with Israel were formed most strongly. 
Israel provided a major service to the United States by destroying secular Arab nationalism 
Which was the greatest enemy of the United States of America and supported Islamic radicalism .. 
The United States has supported and continues to support it. 
Currently 
See an example of this ... through 
Gaza 
Let us remember in the last attack on Gaza 
When I started to implement Israeli ammunition 
During the attack, despite the large amount of weapons Israel possessed 
The United States supplied it with more ammunition 
Through the Pentagon, notice where it came from 
American ammunition was already present in Israel 
Intended for use by US forces 
This is one of the many clues that explain 
How is Israel basically treated 
A soldier to America 
Intelligent and historically strong intelligence relationships 
And many other links 
And media bias 
To support government policy ... 
With very limited questions about marginal particles, but mainly 
Accept this policy, for example, America's invasion of Iraq 
You will not be able to find the phrase (American occupation of Iraq) in the American media 
Although it is clear that there is an occupation 
A clear and blatant picture of violence, a clear example 
When Nuremberg called it the Great Global Crime, they were unable to mention it (occupation). 
President Obama, who has been praised as opposed to the occupation 
What did he say? He said: It is a mistake, it is a fatal strategic mistake that we will not continue with. 
Now this is some kind of opposition 
It is similar to what we heard from the chief of staff of Germany when Hitler invaded Russia 
A major strategic mistake, that should not have been done. We should withdraw 
England first 
This is considered opposition, the same in Vietnam 
There is now a memorial in progress. Great commemoration of America's sacrifices in Vietnam 
Try to find the phrase (America's invasion of South Vietnam) 
In the media during the past years since 1961 
Does not exist, perhaps in Democracy Now 
And what I wrote, but it remains on the sidelines. This is not strange to the United States. 
Take Britain for example 
There are currently serious discussions in the British newspapers, such as the popular Times supplement 
Such was the debate over whether Britain should recognize genocide, and that word was used 
Genocide 
That was a feature of British colonialism 
Hundreds of years ago 
Should Britain start confronting it? You can ask this question in several places 
Tendency 
An educated community that goes like a herd 
To support the authority of the state, and the influence of those with influence is a very big tendency 
Intellectuals like to consider themselves 
Dissenters, critics, and brave men stand up to power 
Absolutely incorrect, if you look at history, you will find it (the real opposition) on a small margin, often punishing 
The general trend tends to 
The so-called "herd of minds that are not independent" are moving in the direction of strengthening state power 
Nothing new here 
Unfortunately, we have to face this herd, not new
