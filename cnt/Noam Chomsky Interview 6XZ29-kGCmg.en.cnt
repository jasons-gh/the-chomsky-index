what has changed since 2014 Trump was
not president at that time and the world
has not completely fallen apart at at
that time now it is a full-fledged war
against immigrants against you know
minority against the poor you know you
name it against the climate against
women and and and people like Modi in
India and Wilson ro in Brazil have
picked up very quickly on his skills and
they have unleashed their share of
terror so how has it changed so
drastically and and what do you foresee
for the future well first of all the the
change has been coming for some time and
it's it's pretty much the same around
the world
so in take Europe the the centrist
political institutions that have been
running Europe since the Second World
War have virtually collapsed election
after election the old traditional
parties center right center left parties
are collapsing the it's pretty much the
same happened in the United States and
2016 the parties kept their names and
but if you look at what happened the
establishment Republican Party was
unable to get their candidate the
Democrats barely squeezed through if it
hadn't been for manipulations of party
managers Sanders might will of won the
elect that won the nomination but if you
look back over the years you can see
that this was coming so take a look at
the Republican primaries for the last
roughly 10 or 15 years every time a
candidate comes from the popular base
they are so outlandish and unacceptable
to the establishment that they get
crushed
michele bachmann the rick santorum
they're just impossible and they managed
to crush them the difference this time
is that they couldn't rush them but for
various reasons on the Democratic side
this is the first time that there's been
a real challenge to the moderate right
establishment which has been the
Democratic Party since the 1970s when
they sort of abandoned the working-class
and became pretty much what used to be
moderate Republicans so all over the
world this has been happening the same
in third-world countries and I think
it's there's individual reasons in many
places but there's also some common
properties that run through the whole
structure that is the neoliberal
programs I mean from the end of the
Second World War
till the 1970s there were what's in
Europe called the tonk Lumias thirty
glorious years here it's called the
Golden Age of capitalism regimented
capitalism with very strong labor unions
a very substantial growth of the highest
growth in American history egalitarian
growth improvement in civil rights civil
liberties of the mentality was for
example Eisenhower was considered a
conservative right was a strong
supporter of the New Deal said that
anybody who challenges the rights to
labor unions doesn't belong in the
political system and all of this changed
in the through the seventies and then
with Reagan and Thatcher in England just
escalated hasn't changed since and if
you look at the nature of this system
what happened is very clear
wages have stagnated real wages in the
United States or about what they were
like the 1970s wealth there has been
growth not as great as before it's going
into very few pockets wells been highly
concentrated that has an immediate
effect on the functioning of democracy
for obvious ways you know all kinds of
effects on who gets elected what they do
huge rise in lobbying cost of Elections
of skyrocketed the courts have basically
opened the floodgates to corporate
funding it means representative in
Congress is spending several hours a day
just trying to appeal to donors for the
next election that meanwhile lobbyists
are meeting with his staff to frame
legislation and of course the lobbyists
overwhelmed the staff and in background
and evidence and power and so on so they
basically write the legislation a
democracy disappears you know most of
the population is essentially
unrepresented and that they're their own
representatives don't pay any attention
to their attitudes and with the of
course the of the major crashes in
2007/8 smashed large majority of the
population benefited the perpetrators
the legislation to the congressional
legislation that the deal with the crash
was very striking it had two components
one was to bail out the banks who were
the perpetrators the other was to offer
some help to the victims the people who
have lost their homes were foreclosed
and so on only one part was implemented
now people don't have to look at the
details to see what's happening they can
see that most of the population has just
been cast
decide it doesn't matter what happens to
them and it's it's pretty self conscious
so for example uh Alan Greenspan who was
running the Fed you know it was in
charge of the wonderful economy that was
highly praised by elites by economist
was called the Great Moderation he was
testifying to Congress about the great
success of the economy that he was
running and he said it it relies on what
he called growing worker insecurity
working people are so insecure that even
when employment unemployment is high
they're too intimidated to ask for
raises benefits and so on which is very
healthy for the economy that's wonderful
you know then of course when the crash
came and smashed them after the crash
same story
Wilkins so of course people are angry a
bitter a lot of resentment she can take
all sorts of forms can take constructive
forms like Sanders Ocasio Cortes the
Democrats late more labor activism it
can also take pathological forms kind of
open up people who are bitter and
resentful or easy prey for demagogues
will blame it all on people even more
vulnerable and they are you know
refugees Mexicans and so on so we're
we're seeing a kind of a social
breakdown in fact it's kind of
reminiscent of something that Ramsey
described in the nineteen you know right
the rise of fascism that the the old the
old system is collapsing the new one has
not yet taken shape and it's a period
when you get more with symptoms
dangerous and I think that's why you see
the sudden breakthrough of Trump after
years of the base failing to get there
their candidate and similarly on the
Democratic side and similarly an
election after election and in Europe
some cases like Brazil similar of a
different other respects but I think the
this kind of neoliberal assault on life
and institutions has taken a severe toll
did you see everywhere and it's very
dramatic if you just look at the figures
so it takes a minimum wage which kind of
sets a floor on wages through the Golden
Age the regimented capitalism minimum
wage tract productivity almost precisely
mid seventies it stops the productivity
increases not as fast minimum wages flat
but which means all wages go down and
the opposite is happening at the higher
end so the rules of corporate governance
were changed in the 1980s under milton
friedman's and others influenced the
corporate goals were set to just work
for shareholders nothing else doesn't
matter what what are the consequences
there are and CEOs were given
essentially permission to constructed
for to construct their own boards that
nominated that determined their salaries
so of course CEO salaries go up minimum
wages flat pulls down other wages CEO
salaries skyrocket pulls up other
management wages which end is these are
among the factors that are giving the
enormous inequality there was also a
huge growth of financial institutions
which means more and more irregular
crashes
the banks instead of working for the
real economy are mostly involved in
transactions that have mavin harmed the
economies are a literal benefit and
they're taking overall huge amount of
capital being wasted in this phonetic
predatory financial institutions so it's
a it's it's a recipe for disaster you've
talked about devices and evils of
fascism and many of your interviews
you've talked about the dangers of
neoliberalism
and you know rapidly rising income
inequality and destitution you've talked
about the dangers of communism also what
would be based on your very long and
activist grassroots experience and and
your scholarly work what would you
recommend as a pragmatic political path
to bring all these people across race
religion color caste and creed and
gender to come together and form a
progressive forward-looking movement
yeah there's just no secret it's pretty
much what I said before within each of
these movements there has to be
developed an understanding of the
importance of what's sometimes called
intersectionality that we're basically
all in this together we have similar
goals maybe different emphases but we
have to work together and a common core
would be a central traditionally it's
been the labor movement a revived labor
movement could have that role again I
think you can move towards that by now
and in fact they would go much beyond so
for example the one very interesting
development in the United States and
elsewhere was the beginnings of the
spread of worker owned enterprises
cooperatives these are very substantial
and scalable I know they can
move forward they can challenge the very
idea of the wage contract we have to
remember the wage contract wasn't given
by God you don't have to go back very
far in American history to find that it
was regarded as an atrocity the
Republican Party in the mid 19th century
that one of its slogans was that wage
labor is different from slavery only in
that it's temporary
that's Abraham Lincoln's Republican
Party what's more important that was the
view of working people you look at the
very lively labor press of the period
same same idea of that being forced to
work for a master is taking away our
fundamental rights as free American
citizens that can be reconstructed too
there's many paths forward possible but
they have to be pursued they don't just
happen by themselves so it's a matter of
picking up the gauntlet running with it
that is what we've been trying to do for
us what you're doing - yeah and you know
like Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire
100 years ago in nineteen hundred and
eleven are the same things are happening
in other countries in Bangladesh and
other places the same as if you know
history repeats itself so it is not
happening here but it is happening
somewhere else you know like so that is
where the history is still on and the
same type of stories we are hearing from
various parts of the world different
problems but always the same answer to
what to do about them
what would be your final words to our
electrical worker brothers and sisters
when it comes to our conversation
recognized that they're right at the
heart of which should be the base for
the development of all the things we're
talking about namely a vibrant
revitalized labor movement working for
fundamental aims first of all just the
kinds of reforms that are needed to make
life tolerable like health services but
further aims like eliminating the need
to spend your life living in a
totalitarian institution under the rule
of masters there's no reason why people
should accept that and it's it's not a
necessity we can think of ways to
overcome it for example worker owned
enterprises other collectives
cooperatives other means
these are longer-term goals but they're
not out of sight they're much closer to
realization than colonizing another
planet that is also the message that
that I'm trying to impart with them in
my classes to create a sense of hope to
create a sense of reassurance because
otherwise it becomes quite depressing
thinking about you know the things that
are happening or what these things are
already happening
Carl paralyzers programs for example are
expanding in large parts of the roast
bill they're still not and in fact some
of them are pretty big like take
Mondragon in Spain that's a huge
conglomerate work around very successful
goes back 60 years productive
enterprises housing finance hospitals
it's a model it's not perfect a lot of
problems but it's a model that can be
that's real and that can be developed
the US Steel Workers Union is now
setting up some connections with
Mondragon they might try to develop some
more things here it's a way out of the
deindustrialization crisis so there are
options but they have you have to but
you don't have to struggle for them
they're not going to be easy to attain
