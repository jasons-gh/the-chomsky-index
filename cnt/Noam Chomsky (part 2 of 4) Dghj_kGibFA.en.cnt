it was bitching well I'm just going back
to tonia square for a moment and it
would be negligent of me this is
once-in-a-lifetime to not ask you
obviously it's an epic thing that's
happening right now over in the Middle
East and if you look at maybe Egypt
specifically as a model for how modern
media could be used as a vehicle to
effectively make change do you think
that the West will take example from
that or is it just something that's a
phenomena we do it all the time and for
years almost all the organism organizing
and activism has been somehow through
the internet a social media haven't been
used as much as they have been there but
remember those are you know that those
are states in which those were highly
authoritarian states there were no other
means of communication so sure facebook
with a means here it is to the less
necessary we can do other things like
crepes yeah we have access to all sorts
of I guess ideologies and but we talk
about these external forces which may or
may not help to shift our perspectives
and our behaviors but what about the
internal mechanisms you know is it
necessary in order for there to be an
organized society for the individual to
have an internal governance mechanism
otherwise we couldn't survive nobody
else good throughout question is what
kind of internal governance mechanism
would be let me cite II couldn't survive
if people just randomly went while so
what sort of mechanisms would you point
us in the direction of it that's what
the first of all a lot of them are just
our instinctive just so take what you're
doing that's interesting different
children the children just start or
normally creative if
they put a child with an ax you know
they'll start painting and drawing from
the there is an internal kind of
exploratory creative drive and there are
also you know I think probably the
classical philosophers like say Adam
Smith were correct and thinking that
sympathy is he thought the core human
instinct and help for others mutual aid
mutual support these are things you find
in every community whether it's a family
or larger community and at and are also
present in states which have to be
controlled and constrained so humans are
complicated creatures that we have to
work out an amalgam of these things so
we have thanks to yourself as an
academic and many others we have a sort
of a critical discourse that we can
approach when criticizing or even just
analyzing the external forces what then
would be the mechanism by which we use
or the metric by which we use to assess
the success of the internal mechanism
but suppose it's a family if they could
cooperate to help one another and ensure
the maximal development of each person
potentiality and interest it's
successful if they're undermining and
destroying each other if it's one of
those families and tolstoy I was talking
about them Anna Karenina well then that
our metrics as it didn't work
remember his comment that is only one
way have a happy family in many ways to
have an unhappy yet indeed indeed Wow so
does I mean we've kind of as a society
almost moved a little bit away from the
notion of the family and more into you
know individualism and that being sort
of more governed by a larger collective
which is sort of fed to us a little bit
tau kan are we using that or can we well
I think it's worse than that I mean the
United States in particular has become a
highly atomized society people of are in
little interaction with one another
they're practically no groups no
organizations activist movements for
example I almost always are based either
churches or universities and that's
because that's all there is they're not
based in union halls because there
aren't Union holds and in fact there's
been a major effort over the past it
goes all the way back but intensive in
recent years to try to destroy
interactions among people and to
separate them and isolate them that's
what consumerism is about and
consumerism is is is an old story but it
keeps reviving and it's independently
and the point is to try to attract
people in individual existence without
concern for others that's the main
thrust of the huge public relations
industry you know maybe a sixth of the
u.s. GDP is marketing and marketing is
largely concerned with control and adam
i zink and separating i mean from the
point of view of those who run the
society the optimal social unit is a
dyad consisting of you and your
television set and maybe the internet
these
but no contact with other people contact
with other peoples dangers see you guys
come full circle that to foucault and
the pelvic on and this perspective of
kind of just keeping watch and making
sure that the unit is functioning or
really that's too kind of a it's a
totalitarian ideal but it's realized to
one or another extents in every power
system to the lesser extent i should
hope but in ours it's not you know a
time it's partly so attitudes and
opinions are very intensively monitored
for a lark to a large extent in order to
the two ends to incite a individual
consumerism factually look back at
business propaganda you know 100 years
ago when the whole huge system took off
it was quite explicit about the need to
direct people towards the superficial
things of life like fashionable
consumption to fabricate once if people
get trapped into that then I'm going to
bother us we'll be able to run the
affairs of the world the way we want but
you know a main purpose of main goal
always of but any form of concentrated
powers to keep people of our bags so
then I suppose the the problem would be
that it's the type of enforcement than
or the type of rules that are put in
place through this mechanism but at the
same time could we not add creativity to
that instead of it just being pushing
consumerism is it possible to include an
element of sort of alleviating the need
for creative function and yet still have
a totalitarian hierarchy trouble with
creativity is it's going to be
independent by definition and that means
it a challenge there's a little
challenge received opinions
accepted attitudes doesn't be I was just
talking to a minus in the kronos quartet
at told me how they had Allen Ginsberg
and reading howl in Carnegie Hall and
they were invited back for tenure well
okay that's what happens when you allow
too much freedom you know what is it is
it freedom or is it just certain ideals
that are sort of resisted to be
challenged and you know maybe if there
was a vehicle to kind of let it happen
this idea of the matrix you know allow
for an element of freedom but control it
at the same time I'm you know people
have to be allowed degree of freedom I'm
even slaves were allowed a degree of
freedom otherwise I'll explode in fact
one of the ways of a good sensible
totalitarian system is also benevolent
it spreads spreads and takes a Saudi
Arabia which is the the most extreme
radical fundamentalist dictatorship but
they keep the population more or less
controlled by giving out distributing
small amounts of the huge wealth that
they had if I can see that all over the
Middle East right now as the
dictatorships are threatened their first
move invariably is to try to offer some
something to the population so diver
