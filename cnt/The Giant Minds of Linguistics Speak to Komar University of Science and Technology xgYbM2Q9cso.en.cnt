today as we have an international
conference here and our dream of cups
our elect express my brand new to all
those who have inspired supported and
helped me reach this state and name is
great and and possible i profoundly
expressed if not equal Britta variety
and the legend from linguistics
professor Noam Chomsky don't observe a
crystal professor's compassionate and
purpose or sickening thinker as well as
the author of modernity attacks
professor under a party the acceptance
of my interview request
in fact this commitment is a sorry for
me but a relevant reading out there is
both an inspiring story and fascinating
reading this reality has a beginning for
me in the past the impact of the
commencement of the fall semester this
year I was in the jury in linguistics
research methodologist class or when our
instructor mr. Carson one day from the
dawn of the course have an office
attacks that's one on that assessment do
of course that we all have to do the
text us to have an interview to the
researchers so that you should learn
more about conducting research in order
field comment was started thinking about
our own instructors everyone including
me had the same thought because we're
instructors have ten minutes in fact
otherwise additionally there we are role
models and Happiness
player types their respective as well we
also put a lot were other researchers in
the city because we were closer to
accessible for us reach them at that
moment our decisions because I have
swapped us critically in access
than that money he said why don't you
think further beyond the common
boundaries of geography nationality and
culture in older dimensions
he has recommended us to think outside
the box think about people at Birth
y-tan interviews must be in the
university study settings and why they
should be nursing so and that might be
accessing suggested us to do the
interview international figures and that
moment something has started ringing in
my head I said to myself and said let me
try it but I don't want my father mr.
Chomsky see no address last night I have
sent him an email with no hope of
getting a reply
the next morning when I woke up
de Souza alarm I still got this at all
these email on my phone I was very
surprisingly in mind that there was very
intense so when I saw my email I was
really surprised then I have to wait for
a few months true I have to wait for a
long time but it was worth it then
questions of entrance of bankers after
all I came to practice a carnie and then
asked all of them to accept my interview
requests and needed and costumed a lot
of time so I was very long time I was
really anxious about whether far enough
would they reply at the end i recently
looted of the borders which are made to
be barriers to be removed to bring about
more burgers and understanding among
entire human populations
this event is greatly significant the
tennis is a collaboration between the
topical index of linguistics it's not on
an international level this is the first
time that all these dark minds together
participate in such an event and answer
the same or similar questions concerning
linguistics language and research and in
Greece it's in the past and now and also
in the future once again I welcome you
and thank the interviews of energies and
I'd like to invite you to the
commencement of energies
[Applause]
first of all I would like to say I'm
very excited and I'm very very grateful
that you have accepted this invitation
and I can never thank you enough for
this opportunity it's her
it's very nice like it's one of the best
days in my life and it will forever stay
like that I will start asking you a
question
sorry can you hear me free the first
question is why does research and
linguistics matter in general to create
fundamental reason why the world
the nineties yeah so we need to conduct
research in linguistics in order to know
ourselves better
yeah so research matters for us as a
fundamental way to under two understand
over beamed sorry I cannot hear you
well yeah so you mean that research and
linguistics in order to understand in
general so it's to understand our
cognitive system better the second
question the second question says how
has research in linguistics changed from
the 1950s to today and from the 1950s
til today and I would like to hear about
examples of your research in particular
well in the nineteen fifties it was
we believed I'll just prove the standard
block that languages can differ from one
another in any possible way and each one
has to be studied on its own without any
preconceptions rather similar things
were believed at the time about
organisms generally it's now known about
organisms that's radically false is a
very small number of possible organisms
they almost they are based on a
fundamental plan that just as very tough
on the same seeds because our language
the more we a new method of inquiry was
developed in the 90s called generative
grammar trying to write to develop
precise formalism that would yield the
sound the meaning of every one of an
infinite number of sentences and be
known before how to do that but the
development of the theory of
computability and mid twentieth century
made perfectly clear that appreciate
business and such efforts were made in a
wide variety of type of logical quite
different languages to refer to either
media results let it show that although
the languages look superficially very
different when we integrate to the
principles that are determining their
character find very little variation in
fact it might turn out
Jeff Bruce is yet but it's they're
converging on a possible thesis that
India
syntax the organization of the structure
of sentences and semantics the
interpretation of what they mean that's
awesome but this part of language thank
you
come on four languages maybe some people
just develop along with the appearance
of humans buttered Yemen in the
evolutionary record this might have been
present right at that time hasn't
changed what's changed is the means of
articulated what's inside so you
articulated quite differently one
language to another what's going on
inside I'm really sorry I couldn't hear
so because of the theories and the
principles that have changed throughout
the this time this period of time the
research at this time and today are
quite different so because of the
theories and the rules that has changed
throughout this time the research of
each time is quite different from the
researcher today in linguistics
but this is these are popular theses I
don't suggest it everyone except my
onion is it's research that's going on
in the generative tradition is
increasingly converging on conclusions
rather than ever yeah moving to the
third question regarding
interdisciplinary of linguistics between
science and philosophy
[Music]
yeah so basically this tells that
because of the fact that philosophy is
the ground of all signs we cannot
separate the science and philosophy and
are intertwined and other errors yeah
moving to the first question
moving to the fourth question do you
think research in linguistics will under
the influence of global language would
only be recognized when they are
conducted in the language of superpowers
and would that affect the universal
grammar
International yeah yeah maybe because
the Seekers armor and the power is
getting more in that country so maybe in
the hunt the next hundred years Chinese
will get over the world moving to the
fifth question it has to be the last one
I'm really sorry
because in your opinion technology
altered the topics of linguistics
research today
how has in your opinion technology
altered the topics
yeah I understand now because you have a
short time um I'm really sad to say that
I was the last question but I have a
request please
yeah I will send you the last two
questions but emails hopefully one if
you may please answer them I will be
really grateful I enjoy talking to you
thank you for the opportunity to answer
some of your questions Roz I hope your
event is going very successfully there
you asked about linguistics and why does
research in linguistics matter well I
would rephrase the question it's like
asking why does any academic subject
matter why does physics matter why does
chemistry matter the answer of course is
in the nature of the phenomena that is
being studied
I would rephrase and say why does
language matter why do languages matter
and then of course you see the answer
straight away because I've never met
anyone who isn't interested in language
in the study of language only functions
that language has whether it's children
learning language or the origins of
place-names or whatever it might be
language is one of the things that
people ask most questions about
linguistics of course is simply the
science of language the scientific study
of language and so it's as important as
the phenomenon that is being
investigated but there's a second reason
it's not just that language is complex
and therefore fascinating to study also
turns out to be rather useful to have a
scientific way of studying language are
all sorts of problems in the world that
are linguistic in origin and linguistics
applied linguistics in this particular
case very very helpful in pointing
towards solutions and that really leads
to your second question where you ask
has research in linguistics changed from
the 1970s until the present day
referring to my research in particular
well the answer is yes indeed when up
until the 1970s I think most linguists
studied language as an end in itself
simply to try and work out the
complexities of human language and
languages and then during that decade
perhaps a bit before - and certainly
since we have the development of applied
linguistics which is the application of
linguistics to solve whatever problems
one encounters and certainly in my case
most of the research topics I've been
investigating
since the 1970s have been applied in
character one of the first was the
application of linguistics to the study
of disability language disability in
children and in adults children who fail
to learn their language well or adults
who lose their linguistic ability this
wasn't my idea I was encountered I
encountered speech therapists speech
pathologists who were involved
professionally in this subject and they
were turning to linguistics asking for
help
was that a way in which linguistics
could help systematize the way in which
that kind of work was being done and
then a couple of decades later working
with language on the internet again this
wasn't my idea the interest came from
people who were encountering various
kinds of problems on the internet search
difficulties for instance and we're
saying I wonder if linguistics can help
here and it turned out of course that it
could so so many of the ways in which
linguistics turns out to be important in
recent times is all to do with the
business of solving problems whether
it's to do with English language
teaching or interpreting and translating
or whatever it might be and so yes it
has changed and of course the branches
of linguistics that have fueled that
change are some of the ones that you
mentioned sociolinguistics and psycho
linguistics and pragmatics in particular
they are so much focusing on language in
the real world of they're bound to have
some relevance when it comes to the
solution of language problems and then
lastly you asked me whether technology
has altered the topics of liqui sztyc
research very much well the answer is
both yes and no I think yes in the sense
that when you get a new medium of
communication electronic communication
in this particular case that doesn't
happen very often in the history of
society then everything really has to be
rethought in the old days it was very
straightforward who had spoken language
and we had written language and there we
were and in English language teaching
you teachers out there you've been
spending a lot of time on the difference
between speech and writing and now we
have
electronic communication which seems to
be a curious amalgam of spoken language
and written language and so yes
everything has to be rethought all the
generalizations that we've made about
the nature of spoken language the nature
of written language have to be
considered once again do they apply
equally forcefully to the study of
electronic language and a great deal of
research now is being done in that
direction but the other side of the coin
is has all this technological change
affected languages in other words is the
English language of the Kurdish language
or whatever language different is it
very different now as a result of the
technology compared with what it was in
say the 1980s before the technological
revolution really took hold the answer I
think there has to be no it hasn't
really very obviously there are a few
new words have come into the language
weren't there before words like blogging
and instant messaging and the mouse and
all this sort of thing and there's a few
new punctuation devices that have come
in as people use punctuation in
different ways in emails and chats and
whatsapp and things like that as far as
grammar is concerned negligible the
grammar that I'm using to you now is
pretty well identical with the grammar
I'd have used to you 20 or 30 years ago
just because technology has come along
hasn't made any impact on the grammar of
English and I suspect of other languages
too so although there have been some
changes perhaps a percentage or two of
the language has developed increased I
would say increased its expressive
richness it hasn't replaced anything and
it certainly doesn't mean that the old
kinds of language we were used to in pre
technological days have changed out of
all recognition but that's precisely one
of the reasons why one should be doing
research into language on the Internet
to establish to what extent change is
indeed taking place and whether there
are certain areas in the language where
this change is more noticeable rather
than others anyway I hope that these few
remarks
we'll first of all illustrate my warmth
of greeting to you all out there for
this occasion that you've asked for the
recording of and I wish you every
success with the event and I hope that
some of the points that have made will
lead to yet more research in your part
of the world into these fascinating
questions thank you very much and
goodbye
today I'll be having an interview with
one of the most outstanding figures in
the world of linguistics who is
professor stephen krashen I'm very glad
that you have accepted my interview
request and I'm very honored I want to
thank you for myself and on behalf of my
University as well and that is my
technical engineer and that is my
granddaughter she's going to come over
and say hello
her name is Sydney which has the best
connection anywhere in the city
bad movie so as part of this what
doesn't happen
now you're equal so I will start asking
you the questions if you may please
answer me I will be very very thankful
you're responsible for a major split and
language teaching profession which in
some places have changed language
teaching dramatically please tell us
about it
okay well this was in 1975 before your
parents were born before your
grandparents were born I was already a
professor a beginning professor doing
research and I had a breakthrough I had
some data that I couldn't make sense of
conflicting data that's usually how it
starts where you have a problem you
can't solve and I found the answer I
think
and the answer says we have two ways two
ways of getting better in another
language you can acquire language and
then I can be a professor in writing the
word you can acquire language we do this
high-tech whatever happened to
chalkboards I love chalkboards anyway
different a quiz is the natural way when
we say I was in France for a few weeks
and I picked up some French that means
you acquired it while is happening you
don't know that it's happening you think
you're doing something else you think
you're having a conversation you think
you're reading a book but at the same
time you might be acquiring so the whole
thing is sub conscious and subconscious
while it's happening
and once you're finished you don't know
you've acquired anything it's all there
subconsciously in your brain it doesn't
need efforts zero effort subconscious
and completely effortless isn't that
beautiful
it's not hard work it's not a written
determination it's relaxing and being
interested in what somebody else says so
that's acquisition the second process we
call learning and learning is when we
now get this right learning is what we
did at school learning is knowing about
language knowing the rules
knowing the grammar in English the
famous rules are a noun is a person
place thing or idea okay supposed to
know the definition the subject and the
verb are supposed to agree third-person
singular go go goes if you memorize
these things that was language teaching
when I was in high school which was in
1903 I think a long time ago anyway we
select a French class and we conjugated
verbs we memorize nouns and that's what
everybody did so these are the two these
are the two methods the brain is very
good at language acquisition the brain
is not very good at language learning a
lot of people like doing it but we're
still not very good at it it's very very
limited now let me tell you how we
acquire language what happens this is
the secret
right here I want to give you a language
lesson Roz is that okay it'll be amazing
okay I have to ask you what languages
you speak though besides Curtis English
and all these do you speak German no I
don't I speak Arabic but yeah I really
put us in English well I know a bit of
French as well because we used to have
French courses in the university but I
was learning it was not acquiring
therefore I think yes I cannot use it
properly yeah with languages all the
languages I know they have the wrong
dialect I speak American English as you
could tell what if those of you who
understand German you'll notice I speak
Austrian German I speak Canadian French
and I speak Mexican Spanish it's always
the wrong one yeah I speak Israeli
Hebrew that's the only one I actually
got right the regular one but all those
in the Peace Corps for two years
teaching there just wear of it my wife
is good anyway but this one will do will
determine and you can hear my Austrian
dialect first you like science fiction
right okay good
here's an old friend of yours this is
mr. Spock yeah mr. Spock yes mr. Spock
mr. Spock heart survive can you see this
what good spy good yeah when I say first
agency you say yeah
[Applause]
[Music]
not every word but more or less I did
everything necessary to teach you German
I'm now going to share with you the most
important concept I have learned about
language the best-kept secret in the
profession we acquire language in one
way and only one way when we understand
it that's it isn't that remarkable we
acquire language when we understand what
people tell us now how they say it but
what they say yeah exactly we acquire
language when we read and we understand
what's on the page and we are research
over the last it's now 45 years we've
been publishing on this it's the only
way it happens there is no other
possibility now let me tell you some
amazing wonderful beautiful things about
language acquisition number one language
acquisition is easy no effort no trying
it's pleasant and it's easy it has to be
pleasant the input if the input isn't
interesting nobody won't pay attention
yeah so it has to be interesting so
that's number one it's effortless no
work
number two no individual variation
everybody can do it
nobody is gifted for language we all
have the same language acquisition
device this is an idea that comes right
from Noam Chomsky himself we have the
same language acquisition device I think
that is absolutely correct okay so these
are two things it's easy and it's
pleasant and adapter comprehension also
the language acquisition device never
shuts off you can acquire language at
any age you can acquire when you're five
when you're 10 when you're 20 when
you're 30 when you're 40 etc I've got
this friend I got to tell you about my
friend his name is Steve Huffman I
regard him as my therapist in language
acquisition he's helped me a great deal
he's what's called a polyglot Steve
Kaufman speaks 15 languages oh my god
man absolutely so I really enjoyed being
with him and he's real I went with him
did a Spanish restaurant in Southern
California we spoke Spanish to the
waiter
he was absolutely easy wonderful I saw
on YouTube a lecture given in French on
my favorite topic namely krashen's
theory of language acquisition Steve was
in the audience in French he raised his
hands he had comments his French was
absolutely flawless it was perfect in
one language conference my Chinese
teacher was there my Mandarin teacher
and he he and I and her friends all
Chinese teachers went to lunch with
Steve Kaufman and he came with us and he
was wonderful his Mandarin is just great
he's wonderful Steve Kot windows 50
languages he acquired eight of them
after age 60 to 62 you know about 70
yeah he reached the level of fluency yes
he's very good in these languages noting
it is remarkable the language
acquisition device never shuts off there
is no critical period now if you're
older you might have a little accident
we can talk about that but people can
acquire nearly the whole thing and do it
very well
so I like to look at what people can do
not what they can't do and they get very
very good advice with us yes I never
thought often it there is no critical
period as we are told in the
universities and schools I like
reviewing papers
I think it's an obligation people review
my papers I review theirs
okay that's fine I tell the editors only
review papers five pages or shorter beep
I have not reviewed a paper for six
years they're all huge I can't keep
track of what the papers in fact so when
you write a paper to realize the people
reading it should have the background
already what you don't have to teach
them everything otherwise they shouldn't
be reading the paper it's short maybe
that's the key and you become more
creative because you're always doing
creative work you don't have to write a
literature review they don't write
literature reviews that's always the
beginning big waste of time at the end
there's advice for future research
who are we to give other people advice
basically they wouldn't if they have the
idea so they wouldn't use your ideas
like yeah they already should have the
idea beforehand
formula for writing a paper during my
own papers if it's empirical I do the
table first the results I get the
statistics right more in clay I state
the main hypothesis first after that go
backwards the procedure the conclusion
the last thing is the introduction well
actually actually one of our teachers
the one who had influenced me to do this
interview as doing the same thing he
always says that we have to write the
introduction last right little action
whenever we give him the introduction
first year of Houston and he says no I
don't want that I wanted less because if
I need the introduction I shouldn't be
reading the deeper and not ready for it
yeah I know I know understand well
actually all the students in my
department should see this interview and
everyone will see it in me in the next
two weeks and they will now know why our
teacher mr. Carson says so he's right
yes so I have a few more questions yeah
one of them is says that is immersion
best oh yes see I could answer that very
clearly the answer is yes of the game is
comprehensible input okay
the immersion can be wonderful you go to
the country and make lots of friends who
find books that happened to me when I
was in Austria when I was a music
student I was getting comprehensible
German all day but sometimes you go to a
country you don't meet anybody you don't
understand what they're talking about
it's hard to break into the culture if
you stay home and read you'll get a lot
more done yeah so that's your middle
yeah the depends on how much input
you're getting the cases we looked at we
have cases where one what about an
innovation students
nearly a year in Canada already
intermediate and she gained about this
much on the TOEFL exam mm-hmm but then
she came back and ran for about three
months to glasses and listen to stories
huge gains so it's not if you're in the
country it's how much in as much
comprehensible compelling input you're
getting yes husband American depends on
the comprehend ability and the input
right and it's not necessary yeah some
of the great language experts in the
world of Steve Kaufman local canto one
of my heroes hardly travel at all I've
done most of my Spanish okay yeah I got
it and I have another question who says
should we first students to speak more
no speaking is the result of violently
I'll tell you what happened with me it's
always good to tell a story this is a
story about Sidney's mother let me just
have to terms she can't hear the story
when Sidney's mother my daughter my
perfect daughter Debbie who was six
years old she went to a neighbor's house
to play with one of her friends and I
was supposed to go over there after an
hour and bring both girls to our house
so the mom could take her class at the
local community college so I went over
and our friend was about to leave
she said wait I have to take my pen she
goes into the kitchen
she took a valium anxiety reducing
medication Spanish class it freaks me
out
Spanish that makes you nervous talking
being called on in class having to give
an oral presentation I that really
impressed me I looked at the research
literature and I found it was true
I found that speaking is the most
anxiety provoking activity in foreign
language classes
Norwest not only that it makes you
nervous it's not necessary
people make wonderful gains without
talking at all I'll give you one example
of many not the only one study was done
in the 1960s by a guy named Sorenson who
in South America went to a small area
between Brazil and Colombia and in this
area there were 10,000 people who spoke
like 15 20 different languages I had
lots of different languages down there
10,000 people listening nothing it's
like a football game
many even a good crowd at a football
game okay so there is a funny role in
the society you can't marry anybody who
speaks your language you have to marry
an outsider who doesn't know your link
so the child grows that gets mommy's
language daddy's language gets the
language of the community the lar larger
turning their whole life they're
acquiring languages how do they do it
silent period for two years they listen
they listen they don't start to talk
until they feel ready and then it comes
I have found this to be true in case
after case especially when you don't
have a class Budapest can make the
silent period shorter because you get a
comprehensible isn't right away but in
the real world it takes time until you
could they say until I can hear the
language that means to understand it me
think
could the famine water it you have to
tell me what I'm saying first yeah so
what do I say I love Curtis that I say
this yeah no yeah could be sanam hot I
understand first hotter it yeah Curtis
is a really wonderful language yet it
has a lot of dial a sort of odd sense
it's very diverse
Oh miss lemon HD and Iraq Kurdistan
region yeah the most peaceful city in
the region hopefully Suleymaniye
recording yeah I'm using an iPhone right
here and I will also use the square
recording today I'm going to have an
interview with one of the most
outstanding psychologists and cognitive
scientists and linguist in the same time
who is a great professor Steven Pinker
I'm very thankful and grateful that you
have accepted my invitation and I want
to thank you on behalf of my university
as well thank you so much oh I will
start asking you really set of questions
about conducting research papers and I
will start immediately why do you think
research matters and linguistics in
general why doesn't matter language is
what makes us human it's one of the
things that makes us human and the more
we understand it the better we can
understand ourselves yeah I wrote one
book whose subtitle was language as a
window into human nature because I
believe that language can reveal the
contents of the mind how we
conceptualize objects and people and
actions and causality and space also
language is a window into our emotions
why are some words taboo why are some
words pleasant why are some words
unpleasant and it's a window into our
social relations how do we interact why
do we use so much politeness
we're done why don't we just learn about
I won't be mean so the more we have the
more research we do on language the more
we understand about ourselves so you
consider the importance of linguistics
research as a key to understand
ourselves better of course has practical
applications including our Centuria code
the design of telephones depended on
understanding speech the teaching of
reading in school depends on an
understanding of how language works the
teaching of a foreign language which is
more and more important now as the world
gets more connected and in particular
more and more people want to speak
English what's the best way of teaching
them English learning any language now
more and more we are interested in how
computers process language in artificial
intelligence how do you get Siri to
understand your speech better to
understand the content of your questions
better and to give intelligent answers
now all of that depends on understanding
the language works yeah so computational
linguistics as well that's right yeah
the second question is that how has
research changed from the 17th of the
last century comparing today's research
and linguistics in your opinion
certainly the availability of large
bodies of text of corpus linguistics has
been a major trend change because no
longer do you have to disciple what bead
or get people's judgments of what words
and sentences they use or you can
actually see how people use language by
looking at the millions of digitized
books the vast amounts of text that are
on the World Wide Web
one can also run experiments as I have
sometimes done where instead of running
an experiment on thirty college students
pay them enough money so they can now go
out for dinner on a Friday night and
then if you're lucky
after some after several weeks you get
thirty subjects now you can get hundreds
of thousands of subjects by testing
people over the web I did a study with
Joshua Hartshorne and Joshua Tenenbaum
which we published in cognition several
months ago testing the hypothesis that
there is a critical period for language
acquisition that is that is there an age
factor which is harder to learn a second
language
now there were many claims that there
that that was true but they were based
on studies of twenty five people a
hundred people we did a study thanks to
a quiz that went viral that have 2/3 of
a million people that would not have
been possible yeah basically the
technology and the tools provided for
researchers is what changed B and the
research of linguistics in the two
centuries yes there are laboratory
studies of speech and of how people
understand sentences word by word by
word another innovation has been in
neuroimaging that is in looking at the
activity in the brain as someone that
understands words and and sentences
again I've been involved in some studies
like that including one study that done
in collaboration with doctors where we
actually looked at people who have
electrons that pierce the brain woman
sat on top of the brain now of course
you can't ask people to volunteer to
have a hole drilled in their skull and
these are patients who had surgery to
treat their epilepsy they had a
neurological disorder to begin with but
because they had electrodes in the brain
that allowed the surgeons to record
electrical activity while they were
waiting to have a seizure they did do
experiments on understanding words and
sentences and so by collaborating with
neurologists we were able to pick up
activity in the brains of people has
they
processed language and that is with
techniques such as magnetic functional
magnetic resonance imaging fMRI with
better techniques to record electrical
activity from the scalp encephalography
which picks up the very fate of
magnetics and signals emanating from the
brain we know much much more about
language that's a great achievement and
I could never imagine that things like
that have been done any more than they
were the main method of studying
language in the brain was to look at
people who had had strokes and brain
damage from a head injury or a blood
clot and then to see what aspects of
language no longer worked and then just
correlate that with what part of the
brain was damaged sometimes you have to
wait till the patient died and an
autopsy was done on their brain to find
out where their brain lesion was now of
course that can be measured with MRI and
you don't even have to look at people
who learn about brain disease or brain
damage you look at people like me and
you and measure the activity from their
brain as they are understanding language
so it's easier nowadays that's really
cool my third question is regarding and
the Disciplinary of linguistics between
science and philosophy which one
[Music]
philosophy can't tell you how language
works in a human mind
because philosophy is really about the
inherent nature of ideas not about how
our species
happens to process language but but
philosophy of language has helped us
with theories of what do we mean by
meaning or that what is the meaning of a
word look at that what do we even mean
when we use the word meaning yeah what
is truth
and its occupant philosophers who have
made contributions to linguistics in
talking about what language is used for
that is when we produce a sentence
are we informing people are we trying to
get information from them are we
commanding them are we declaring
something like a marriage which is true
as soon as you declare it those speech
acts as they are called really first
laid out by philosophers like John
Austin and HP rice and John Searle so
many people who call themselves
philosophers kind of work requests yeah
so basically you've seen that that
philosophy is the ground of linguistics
and science can improve that idea that
we take from the philosophy that exists
different questions philosophers are
often interested in in the nature of
concepts what different ideas actually
mean how they're related to other ideas
and they aren't in the business of
studying what goes on in
moment-to-moment as we think but they
two disciplines talk to each other and
all of my career I have taken ideas from
philosophy and used them to sharpen
arguments and to form hypotheses in
psychology and linguistics yeah that's
really great yeah my first question is
do you think that research and
linguistics will under the influence of
the language of the only recognized when
they are conducted in the language of
superpowers like for example we have
Chinese English Korean these the
language of superpowers
well the it is true that more and more
English has become the the lingua franca
everyone Senate language here you and I
what language are we are we speaking in
we're speaking in English yeah all over
the world when I go to assign to the
conference when I go to a business
conference or I go to a tech conference
the language is English it's partly
because of the because the United States
of America is a superpower but probably
even more important was the fact that
the British Empire was spread out all
over the world in so many parts of the
world in Africa in Asia in the Americas
used to be English colonies that reduce
even Iraq was was invaded by the England
of the English Empire and in the past
not to be that's yes exactly another
example that is right I did a study with
some computer scientists at MIT looking
at the global language network that is
if you're translating from language to
language be do you often go through some
intermediate language so for example if
you were translating from Kurdish you to
Japanese probably there'd be in Kurdish
dating might be Kurdish to English
English to Japanese or perhaps Kurdish
to Arabic Arabic to Japanese meaning and
so we mapped out a network of different
languages and how they're connected to
each other in terms of which books tend
to be translated into pairs of languages
which women pedia articles tend to be
appear in what if they're in one
language whatever language will they up
here and in some languages like English
like Spanish like Russian like Arabic
are hubs where you're more likely to go
from one language to another language
through a language like English yes or
so for English than Arabic even though
Arabic is spoken by hundreds of millions
because there are fewer books get
translated into Arabic than you would
think based on the size of the speaker
of the speaker body for Arabic one of
the striking things about the Arab
speaking world is how few books get
translated into Arabic I think more
books get translated into into Greek
even though very few people speak Greek
but people in Greece have more of are
more open to the outside world in Arabic
speaking countries shortened that's
because of the culture they because of
the religion that they have and other
barriers maybe that's exactly right now
the other question which is combined to
the first one is do you think this will
affect the universal grammar what we
talking about right now well in the
sense that was coined by Noam Chomsky
many years ago then it would not because
when he used the word universal grammar
he refers to the design blueprint for
language that is born into every human
baby and so that almost by definition
would not be affected by how which
language has the most speakers that
would be just affected by what makes a
human being a human being
yep so it's a lot like what the first
question is how has linguistics I'm
sorry
how has in your opinion technology
affected research topics and linguistics
actually amend the topics the topics of
research in linguistic for example we
have researchers here who conduct
research and linguistic like how
Facebook or how viber change the rules
of grammar Oh
how technology actually changes language
itself yeah how he was changes or yeah
how English changed how does it affect
the topics like the talent the topics of
research is affected I think there's
more interesting for example
neurolinguistics language in the brain
because of the availability of new
technologies to study it yeah I think
they're going to be more more research
into language change because in the past
to study how language changes you have
to wait until the language changed and
then do very close studies and
particular constructions through
particular texts now it is track
language change as it actually happens
by analyzing material on the World Wide
Web
so I suspect that language change will
be an increasing topic because it's
easier to study it is easier and it's
more obvious to researchers they can use
more examples and use life examples in
their research yes the other question
says why are there more sociolinguistics
research than psycholinguistics ones and
in my country I think yes I don't know
the answer to that question it's often
hard to answer questions about why some
topic is more popular than others in
academia because there are there are
fads there are trends there are emphases
that Dean's and donors and governments
put on university research so
unfortunately I don't know the answer to
your question thank you so much let's
move to the other question like the
question is there may be personal to you
but I would love to know has any recent
research changed your point of view on
universal grammar
difficulties of finding anything that is
completely Universal across the world's
language languages means that it's
harder to specify what is a universal
grammar there are some linguists who are
skeptical of the very idea because now
that we have more and more grammars more
and more studies of languages that are
unrelated to English and other
indo-european languages it's not so easy
to specify what Universal grammar is and
so it needs a I think it needs a rethink
and need someone to come up with more
abstract and a better characterization
of what's a universal grammar because
it's not easy to say what it is
yes well the the firmer the definition
of universal grammar will be then we
will know what exactly Universal grammar
mean yes there was the last question for
the interview thank you so much and I'm
very glad and honored that you have
accepted it I have two questions
yes there's not all how many languages
do you know
can you speak well in terms of fluency I
would say really only English although
it various times in my life I have also
spoken French and I grew up in in Canada
in Montreal just a bilingual city but
when I grew up there was the French
English communities were quite separate
so IDs I met very few francophone
french-speaking people when I grew up
and then I moved out of Canada more than
40 years ago so even the French that I
spoke then has gotten much worse I've
also spoken Spanish at one point I
visited a friend of mine in Colombia and
his mother spoke no English at all so
she spoke to me like I was a three year
old child and I learned a lot of Spanish
and also Hebrew I like to keep him
school I spent some time in Israel but
also again that was decades ago
it's rusty so exposed having used the
language in the past and understanding
the structure of those languages has
helped me in my research but I be very
embarrassed if I have to have a
conversation in any of those today
well what you think language that you
could speak are very very hard language
and you should be very proud yeah the
other question or maybe a request they
say I love Kurdistan but in credit I
will say it and you repeat it back to me
could this bottom question it can you
say that could you find him okay cause
this famine hoarser it Crysta exactly
but hotter it yeah yeah I love Americans
have very warm feeling sports
participant and despite the events of
the last few weeks with our President of
the United States but if you ask most
Americans the feelings toward Kurdistan
are very warm and there's a lot of
solidarity a lot of respect admiration
almost everyone knows that from the
people not from the authority the people
of America loves the people of criticize
it so much it's true and we love you so
much thank you so much I'm sorry I was I
was very nice I'm very honored that you
have accepted the interview I will use
this recording in a symposium that I
will hold maybe next month in my
university and it will be published life
I'll send you the link please do I don't
thank you so much have a great day
today I will be having an interview with
one of the greatest and most upstanding
figures of linguistics series professor
Andrew Kearney thank you very much for
accepting my invitation and request I
will immediately start asking the
questions due to the issue that happened
previously thank you so much for
accepting my request again why does
research and linguistics matter in
general linguistic research is critical
language is the main primary way we
communicate with each other and as we
deal more global society understanding
how languages are structured and what
the structures mean means that people
will be able to communicate more
effectively and I think that is a
critical part of why linguistics is
important it's the world I also think
it's important that we start to be able
to talk about languages that are
endangered languages that are not well
documented precisely because those
cultures and those people as well and
linguistics allows us to do that so I'll
help keeping these languages which are
in danger and not about to die yes
exactly
how has research from the nice have
changed comparing to research and today
[Music]
we have access to large datasets that
can be analyzed using computational
tools so nowadays the tools and the data
have changed and it's easier for
researchers and scholars to conduct
research you think that for other people
that is true however it is you are still
following the traditional school yeah
that's great
regarding interdisciplinary of
linguistics research between philosophy
and machlin science which one should be
considered more and linguistics research
and which one is more reliable do you
think it's what makes the most
interesting approaches to the study of
scientific method
but at the same time the kind of
experiment that I use essentially with
myself or with a native speaker that I'm
working with another language that's yes
yeah so you follow both both of the
methods right so they're intertwined and
they work together
yes I have what about your opinion about
research on linguistics like the
question is do you think that research
and linguistics will under the influence
of the global language be only
recognized when they are conducted on
the language of the superpowers like
Chinese Korean French English grammar
was mainly about English maybe a little
bit but Spanish so back when it started
in the 1960s that was the focus but in
the United States now that is very much
not the case the expectation is that
we're going to look at other languages
because those other languages will tell
us things that we haven't learned from
English and Spanish and the global
languages for example in my department
you have to we specialized in the
linguistics of three different language
families the indo-iranian languages the
Celtic languages which is my area and
Native American languages languages
spoken by the Indians who live in this
country yeah you need to be Amazon who
used to live there they still live here
they live in they live in their own
communities so like the Navajo and the
is a language spoken right here in
Tucson oh my goodness I can't I will
never be able to because they're so very
different from English in all the cases
the Celtic languages the native
languages the Iranian languages they're
all very different from one another
and they're very different from English
and that told us a lot about how
language can be structured so it helps
to explain the structure of language
better so the hypothesis should be
correct and valid in more than one
language in that case only the
hypothesis will be correct and will
become a theory I know understand how do
you think technology have changed topics
and research of linguistics in this
country I've used some discipline of
linguistics has been created that wasn't
before and this is really in the past
10-15 years it's the study of human
language technologies things like
machine translation automatic speech
recognition text to speech are all
technologies that didn't exist before
and the study of those technologies is
very popular here it's very popular for
students who want to work in companies
and don't want to work in academia so
for example we've created a new program
just for those students to study these
technologies so they can go and work for
a company so it is useful for those
people who want to be employees for
companies and not for people who want to
study or to continue their work in the
academia
want to study in an academia also can
benefit from these but the target
audience is for people who want to work
for Google or companies like that yeah I
know intersect why do you think there is
more sociolinguistics research than
psycholinguistics research today
absolutely true I think there's just as
much psycho linguistics and
sociolinguistics but it's certainly the
case of sociolinguistics
is very popular and I think it's because
when you first come to linguistics
sociolinguistics is the most obvious
part of the study because it's the thing
that you can observe all over have you
all the time
how does language influence culture how
does culture influence language when I
started as a linguist I wanted to be a
socialist but then I discovered syntax
and then yeah the world because it is so
tangible in our lives yes no tangible
and it is so obvious the relation is so
obvious and I think almost every culture
even here in the critics culture it's
very obvious yeah and I will be asking
you one more and the last question which
is has any recent research changed your
point of view of universal grammar and I
think that's actually false because my
hypothesis is something that can be
proven or disproven
where does universal grammar is meant as
an explanation it's a belief where
you can't prove the universal grammar to
be true or false because it will always
predict your phenomena you can you can
test whether a particular theory of
syntax so government and binding theory
or minimalism or headroom phrase
structure grammar you can test whether
those are true or false because you can
look at the data and see whether the
data is support them or not but
Universal grammar is not a theory of
that time it's not testable in some ways
it's a little bit you can yeah so as you
have mentioned before there are two
parts of people two sections of people
one of them are the Thomas cans and the
others are the other people who isn't
exactly so for you and for now for me as
well you know girls universal grammar is
not a hypothesis it is like a belief
because it's not the led language
acquisition device and stuff and then we
have to kill lots of people that's not
doing it thank you so much for accepting
my interest my interview and my request
it was very nice of you I'm very honored
and very glad that I have done this
thank you so much I want you to say yeah
it was very nice from her and I and I
love I love to be able to help her
one way or another
thank you so much thank you so much
