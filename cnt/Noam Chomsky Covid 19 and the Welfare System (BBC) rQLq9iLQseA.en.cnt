this is James Menendez Widnes l-life
from the BBC for many people are at and
the world life is always precarious a
daily struggle for survival but for lots
of other people life in the 21st century
is relatively secure with levels of
comfort material wealth and good health
unimaginable a hundred years ago and
naturally this pandemic has made that
group of people suddenly feel much more
insecure both in terms of their health
and the financial prospects today's
unemployment figures in the US are
testament to that so how might the
coronavirus changed the way we organize
ourselves what are the flaws it's
already exposed for one view on this I
returned to the radical academic Noam
Chomsky now 91 professor Chomsky was
born just before the Wall Street Crash
of 1929 and since coming of age he's
railed against the failings of unbridled
capitalism through his writings on
linguistics philosophy politics and the
mass media I asked him first about those
staggering jobless numbers as he fear
that society might actually collapse
very weak social welfare system and
therefore it also an entirely
dysfunctional health system and that can
be fixed very quickly by Congress it's
possible to direct funds immediately to
the people who are losing jobs not to
the corporations to have fritter away
the last you glory days with stock
buybacks and are now pleading for
assistance but funds can go directly to
the people and that can be done at an
enormous scale doesn't have to be at the
scale of world war ii but that shows you
what can be done if there's the wiggle
and if serious direction could come from
the White House is it possible that the
real danger from this pandemic is from
the economic shock that it creates that
could be any country that has its own
currency and a relatively which country
shouldn't have any problem simply
dealing in some fashion with the
economic crisis
there's a human crisis just of deaths
but we should bear in mind that sooner
or later we will recover from this we're
not going to recover from the melting of
the polar ice sheets so I think this is
a terrible situation with the
coronavirus everything should be done to
deal with it we should keep in mind that
we have far greater threats looming and
not in the distance so if this perhaps
just a harbinger of of what is to come
if the predictions about climate change
come true in the decade it's to come it
has been known for years that pandemics
are very like including coronavirus
pandemics like source which is about the
corona five steps were not taken to do
to prepare for okay we can learn a
lesson from that other pandemics are
going to come and with the attack on the
environment they're even more likely
than before we can prepare for them now
there are impediments and we should pay
attention to what they are one
impediment is a reliance on
profit-making institutions like drug
companies for them there's very little
profit in preparing for a future
catastrophe you can make more money by
doing the things that you can sell in
the market tomorrow if they are the
institution's responsible for preparing
for a crisis we're in deep trouble but
here comes the second problem government
is supposed to be the problem we're not
supposed to allow governments to do
anything except bail out corporations
when they crash the economy and
subsidize them but we're not allowed to
govern a little of do anything
constructive
that's called neoliberalism now that's a
serious problem these problems can be
overcome we don't have to live in a
society based on these insane principle
but if we don't there will be more and
more severe pandemics but won't it be
the private-sector dynamic private
companies that end up producing all the
tests
that where we know and he did all the
ventilators that are a needed for those
who become seriously ill and ultimately
probably a vaccine too if there will be
a vaccine produced by private
corporations it'll come where it's
profitable for them and it'll be very
very expensive there are other paths
polio when I was younger was a terrible
threat
it was overcome but the Salk vaccine
created an a government based
institution that was free no patents
these things are possible they're not
going to happen if you rely on private
profit oriented institutions which
maximize profit for sure but can it be a
combination of both can't it be
government government harnessing those
private companies and all the
intelligent people that work within them
to turn science to our advantage and
come up with some answers to this the
simple answer is to return to a pre
known neoliberal system of regimented
capitalism in which the government can
step in when there's need and in fact
did a great deal the reason why you and
I are are able to talk now on using
computers as satellites the Internet is
because of massive government-funded
research and development back in the 50s
nearly six later handed over to private
enterprise for marketing and profit but
that can be done and more deeply we have
to ask if we want to live in a world
where decisions are transferred from
governments which at least are partially
under popular influence for transferred
from them to private tyrannies which are
totally unaccountable to the pro public
so for a very sensible non radical
outcome of this crisis would be bailout
and corporations that have been feeding
at the trough for years when they could
have been working for the public benefit
bail them out but with conditions
conditions that there be a complete ban
on stock
by out none of that ban on tax havens
can this be done of course this is like
a cool for greater regulation but not
for another total upheaval of the global
economic order it's got bling back to an
economic order that existed nothing
radical about that it was torn to shreds
by the neoliberal fanaticism but it can
go back to that then we can ask about
going beyond of asking serious questions
about the nature of the world in which
we want to live professor Noam Chomsky
