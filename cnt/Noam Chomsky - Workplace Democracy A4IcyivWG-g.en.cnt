first of all we should we should bear in
mind that we don't have a Titleist
system and no capitalist system has ever
survived it would self-destruct in five
minutes so what we have is a kind of
state capitalist system with the state
playing a substantial role in American
history of very substantial role in
economic development in production and
research and development a lot of other
times in bailouts lots of other devices
to keep the private sector viable so
it's a kind of a state capitalist system
like others not they vary a little on
how they do it so is there an
alternative to this of course for
example the alternative that was taken
for granted by 19th century workers
before it was sort of beaten out of
people's heads by massive propaganda
they go back to the early Industrial
Revolution which was right around here
eastern Massachusetts as the period
probably the freest press ever in the
United States there were lots and lots
of newspapers representing different
ethnic groups class workers all sorts of
people and they were there was a lot of
participation and direct participation a
very lively press widely read and so on
and if you look at the working-class
press they were expressing the common
view of working people namely that the
firm those who work in the mills should
own them and run them you know that's
very natural and as I said we've come
close to that a number of times
terrifying to have meaningful political
democracy without functioning economic
democracy and I think this is at some
level understood by working people that
has to be brought to awareness and
consciousness but it's just below the
surface and in fact things are happening
so some of the most interesting or
around the
in Ohio around the Cleveland area
Cleveland project there's a dozen maybe
hundreds of not huge but significant
enterprises that our work around worker
managed in some places there are the
biggest one the biggest worker owned the
collection of conglomerate is Mondragon
and the vast country that's worker owned
but not worker managed and it's a you
know industries banks schools
communities very broad the configuration
and there are various other elements of
it here and there are a couple of quite
good books just come out about it one by
gar alperovitz America beyond capitalism
which is about the worker owned
enterprises that are sprouting around
the country now this could go much
beyond and in fact I think we can also
go back to the days of that we're
beginning in the 1930s of takeover of
industrial production there are cases of
it there are cases where we've been come
pretty close to workers taking over
workers and communities at taking over
industry and producing things that can
be needed and that could if there was
enough public support that could have
been done in the last few years so for
example when Obama took over the auto
industry it was basically nationalized
and there were a couple of paths that
could have been followed one path was
the one that was followed reconstitute
it give it back to essentially the same
you know banks management and so on a
couple of different names that was one
way public paid for that an alternative
was to hand it over to communities and
the workforce and have them turn to
producing things that the country very
badly needs like say high-speed rail
skilled workers and
the rest bill have the capacity with a
little help to do that and the country
badly needs it and they need the jobs
and that rebuilds a popular movement
which can be again on the forefront of
change that's these are possibilities
and across the board there's a any
number of things we can do so I don't
think there's any shortage of
opportunities there's a shortage of
dedication to making use of those
opportunities sit-down strikes which
were again significant a significant
level and I think 30s were very
threatening to to management and
ownership because of sit-down strike is
one step before taking over the factory
and having the workers taking over the
factory and running and kicking out the
managers Democratic control of
institutions whether their communities
or workplaces or any others alliances
among them federal arrangements these
are all perfectly feasible alternatives
there's no economic or political theory
that tells us is anything wrong with
them they conflict with the structure of
existing power systems and therefore the
educational and cultural system tries to
drive them out of your minds make them
seem you know and saying or crazy or
unthinkable but there's nothing I think
about them and you can move towards
realizing them in fact even in the
United States you know major discussion
of these things there are probably
thousands of self-managed enterprises
not huge ones
lots of them and they're growing and
they couldn't as I mentioned they could
reach the scale of say producing the
green technology high-speed rail and so
on that the country badly needs it's not
the law of nature that we have to import
solar technology from China
you know for developing country or that
we have to get high-speed rail
facilities from Spain
those aren't laws of nature those are
political decisions social economic and
political decisions that can be made
differently if they're made differently
enough we'll be moving towards a kind of
