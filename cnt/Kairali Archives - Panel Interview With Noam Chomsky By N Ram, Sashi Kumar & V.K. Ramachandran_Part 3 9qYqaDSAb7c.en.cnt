welcome to this special program
on Kyra Lee channel this is a panel
conversation between professor Noam
Chomsky of University versus
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
nology and two leading experts in the
field of the mass media in India in ROM
who is editor of frontline and also
editor of business line at sports star
and Shashi Kumar the chairman of the
Media Development Foundation which has
established in Chennai the Asian College
of Journalism Noam Chomsky is perhaps
the world's most renowned academic
scholar he is the founder of the modern
science and linguistics he is a social
theorist activist
media critic and author of many books
philosopher and a great inspiration to
people involved in anti-imperialist
activism all over the world
in your framework of analysis
manufacture of consent by the media it's
part of a continuum so would you do what
in response to Tom's first question what
you're emphasizing is the continuity
it's one thing but I mean it's it's also
true the academic profession it takes a
economics you know I mean in economics
there's certain things you measure there
other things you don't measure called
externalities well if you look at the
decisions I mean they have a strict
ideological component you measure things
that are going to be useful for
achieving the purposes of power
externalities you don't count so I mean
take say the US and Mexico you measure
what's called trait if you want to
estimate the you know the wonders of the
so-called free trade agreements emphasis
so-called because they're not free trade
agreements but if you look at them you
ask well how much has trade increased
how much has gross domestic product
increase so the few things you look at
if you look at those things we get a
pretty picture negative headlines and so
on but what you don't ask is what
happened to hundreds of thousands of
Mexican farmers who were driven off the
land because so they because they can
compete with highly subsidized US
agribusiness and that destroyed their
communities and their lives and their
support systems and drove them into
urban slums and finally forced them into
the United States where they get killed
by border guards I don't count these
things those are externalities let's
take your second question the one about
different model the difference in each
society is itself no so if you apply it
to you know Soviet Union they would look
a little bit in fact and so the Union is
not even worth applying it because the
center of power was too obvious so it's
not I think you're you're asking about
Europe and you can trace it
it's not a striking fact that almost all
firstly you can't just you know I mean
the model is
almost a triviality we don't even call
it a theory in fact it's common sense a
simple common sense the bulk of the work
in fact the whole book is concerned with
working out the empirical details what
actually happens in crucial cases and we
took a whole Nations coverage of the top
books herschel cases which would test
how it works and it's astonishing I mean
it goes beyond what you'd predict the
level of conformity
now this detailed intensive work has
been almost entirely done in the United
States they're summoning when virtually
none in continental Europe and so you
know you don't really have the empirical
basis for drawing conclusions a part of
the reason it's not done in continental
Europe is because the intellectuals
there are much more conformist than in
the United States they believe that
they're free and independent and how
could anybody ask any questions about us
look how courageous and trillions of the
people and so on it's total nonsense I
mean they're highly conformist and
subservient but so much so that they
won't even study themselves you know a
general impression at the European
presser has more space for for the truth
for facts for the country
I mean in fact when you look at let's
take French for the French press it
takes a something that concerns France
like France and Algeria or for that
matter France in the Second World War
no I mean the during the whole post-war
period the truth about France in the
second world war with suppressed it was
finally exposed by scholars in the
United States and then it sort of
drifted into France but they were
shocked to discover what anybody who
looked from the outside knew was true
that France was a collaborationist
country and they were the eath including
the French intellectuals you know almost
all of them they there was a resistance
but it was a small resistance it was him
you know courageous people say friends
in Algeria I mean the the the the
atrocities that the French
carried out in Algeria are only now
beginning to be exposed because of you
know generals and the army is a I did
this horrible thing it gets worse at
when France left Algeria it left it the
way Britain left Nigeria and so on the
idea was to maintain the colonial
structure but in a different framework
that's the way all the European
countries in decolonized let's try to
maintain the structure but with a
different form alright in North Africa
and Algeria
there was an independence movement it
gradually dissolved for various reasons
it ended up with a system in which
French intelligence is closely
integrated with the Algerian government
and they are carrying out murders terror
right now this is not being it's
beginning to be exposed in France
I mean how Giri ins have been exposing
it for a long time it's just - let me
give you one example which I was
involved in so I know about it there are
many there's a lot of us what's called
Islamic terror in Algeria and some of
them actually is radical Islamic terror
but it's pretty clear that a lot of it
probably most of its being carried out
by the government under the guise of
Islamic terror well there a few years
ago a group of Algerian expatriate
scientists physicists and others tried
to put together a study careful study of
the atrocities in Algeria I knew about
this because one of them happens to be a
colleague of mine in the physics
department at MIT so learned about it
from him and followed it and they asked
me to write the introduction of the book
so I wrote it so there's a big book
which is a detailed careful study done
by quite competent scientists and
historians in which they simply study
the massacres case by case and asked
what happened and a typical story of
something like this there's a slum area
very always very poor areas exactly the
areas you'd expect the Islamic militants
not to hit you know it's the air base of
support so there's a slum area somewhere
people come in dressed in Islamic garb
and so on and they started murdering
everybody and it goes on for ten hours
five kilometres away there's big
military base and nobody notices nobody
comes over and does anything when the
massacre is over and the people are dead
there's a big propaganda that Islamic
massacre
six months later some general buys the
land and built a hotel that's a typical
massacre and they give case after case
like this big thick book worth the
introduction it was impossible to get it
published in France
oh they in the background is the fact
which I talked about my introduction
that probably the Algerian state and
French intelligence are manipulating
this and there's reasonable evidence for
it they couldn't get published in France
so they've got published in Switzerland
you couldn't get a copy into France
finally one copy of the book got into
France through my efforts I asked an
American expatriate living in France to
get the American Library in Paris to buy
one copy so ok one copy of the book done
in the France they tried to have a press
conference to open the book it was
suppressed France does not and they do
not want to know about their ongoing
atrocities
now they it's not I don't want to make
it a hundred percent so like a little
more people might ich is quite different
there are exceptions but overwhelmingly
this is the way it works and it's the
same in every country you everyone I've
ever looked at I mean in Britain there
is a good media analysis group in
glasses University and they have exposed
the ethic things been by the British
press which are there's no mission no
holdup question on this just a
manufacturing consent isn't it also the
case that what is really happens in the
Second World War from from Truman to
Clinton and Bush is the ascendancy of
the American information system
and the US has consciously spent money
on that something like three trillion
dollars um information a sentencing so
at the rest of the world is really
caught into a mold of Taylorism much of
it even in cinema friends the
polymerization that you don't have
bacterias and I say or any others are
the fact that well I'm sure you remember
but back in the in the 1970s the the
third world tried to Institute through
the United Nations a new international
information order that Commission yeah
my fried Commission and others they
tried to work at three danesco what they
were calling for was an opening up of
the international media so there could
be some level of participation from the
South yes well that led to total history
in the United States there was a huge
attack on it there was a pretense that
they were trying to stop freedom of the
press which is a total wide lie after
lie was produced it could never be
refuted the the UNESCO of people McBride
himself they were not allowing the
publish a letter in the New York Times
responding to it finally the United
States virtually destroyed destroyed
UNESCO in order to prevent a slight
opening of the information system which
would have meant marginal participation
by the South if you look at resources
you can imagine how it would have come
was opened up but the idea that there
might be some breakdown in the
totalitarian control did lead to
hysteria there's a very good book about
this called hope and folly it Herman was
one of the people that book was
published by a University Press major
press it has never been mentioned it's
never been reviewed it's never been
mentioned exposing the whole thing and
that reflects their understanding that
you must maintain tight control over
information this morning's newspaper
there's a disco or discusses how the US
and Britain are coordinating their
propaganda efforts to in to enable them
to compete with Taliban propaganda I
mean if you had a responder but but
that's the but that expresses the quite
proper fear of those
who run the world of the credit fair
anything gets out of control even the
smallest thing the whole system could
unravel it may be Taliban propaganda we
can't compete with oh man you wrote a
famous essay I recently downloaded it on
the net appeared in the New York Review
of Books in I believe February 1967 the
responsibilities of intellectuals and
that was in the background of your not
only your opposition to the Vietnam War
but you are among the first American
intellectuals it's considered a
watershed to oppose the war and I
remember the one of the formulations
it's the responsibility of intellectuals
to expose the lies of governments etc
what is the responsibility of
intellectuals both American and
intellectuals or intellectuals abroad
including Indian intellectuals we sorry
the present international crisis about
policy outcomes what is their
responsibility
that's pretty elementary tell the truth
don't subordinate yourself to the power
systems tell the truth and tell it to
the people who have to know like they're
friends of mine and the Quaker movement
and others who have the slogan tell
truth to power I've never agreed with
you not tell truth to power they know
all about it already what you do is tell
truth to the powerless and don't tell
truth to them but listen to them you
know be part of the powerless interact
with the powerless you used your
capacity or your luck and we're
intellect to be an intellectuals to be
lucky to be privileged to be much too
wealthy more wealthy than we ought to be
to have training and
you know access to resources I mean you
can do things you can do things that
ordinary poor people can't do so you
should join them participate with them
contribute what you have as a result of
your own privilege which you shouldn't
have but you do have and be part of them
you don't tell them truth you learn
truth from them you contribute what you
can and you in the case of in this case
I mean we should be working day and
night to stop one of the major
atrocities of the modern times you know
a planned mass murder of several million
people that's not a small thing and we
should try to break the monopoly of
control by the you know the British and
American and Western and in fact
organized not just media but the
propaganda system in general and bring
people get people understand it that's
what happened during the Vietnam War
there were very few intellectuals who
opposed the Vietnam War ever who went to
jail
yeah but you know there were a few
people not much in fact the difference
between the intellectuals and the
population is quite dramatic there's
good studies of it I mean a tiny
percentage of elite intellectuals
opposed
I mean at some time let point everyone
opposed the war like the business
community opposed it it was just costing
too much but if you look at the
principled opposition
you know opposition because it's wrong
among intellectuals virtually
non-existent you kind of find a phrase
virtually in the major journals or
opinion or media or whatever saying the
war was wrong the most you can find that
this sort of left end is Anthony Lewis
of the New York Times it began with
blundering efforts to do good but by
1969 it was clear that it was costing to
us too much so it was a mistake that's
the critical position you take a look at
the population the United States is a
very heavily Pope a lot of opinion
studies very intense the Chicago Council
of Foreign Relations does regular
studies of people's had
foods on all sorts of topics since 1969
they have regularly published studies on
this and won a lot of questions are
about to Vietnam War of course one of
the questions is where you think about
the Vietnam War and people have a series
of choices an open question you don't
get high numbers on an open question
usually but on this you do about 70% of
the population from 1969 up until today
says the Vietnam War was fundamentally
wrong and immoral not a mistake
okay that's 70% of the population or
virtually none of the intellectuals and
those are remarkable numbers because
they never hear it every person who
answers that way made it up for
themselves because they never read it
and they never heard it
intellectual opinion is well you know
it's benign effort that went wrong it
was a mistake but not the population
there's no time for questions on
linguistics heartrending but necessary
necessaries just like Osama bin Laden
it's a legitimate terror it's legitimate
terror you know unfortunate but it's
legitimate that's the Economist
Economist and bin Laden are identical
except for which terror and the
Economist is much more far away remember
they're going to drive the people they
don't like out of the world yes bin
Laden wants to drive us out of the
Muslim world intellectuals just one
quick follow-on question if I made the
problem of who the intellectual is in
the because television also manufactures
quick-fix intellectuals now and people
like the reader warning us against
intellectuals against the temptation of
the media do you think there's a case
for that I don't even use the word
intellectual I mean intellectuals are I
mean I've known people who I would call
intellectuals who never went to school
you know we just became self educated
and know much more than professors I
know at Harvard it's a you know it's a
term that privilege people use to refer
to themselves and we shouldn't drop it
you know it's people who want to find
out and understand the world with that
we must end and I'm sure I'm especially
both of you join me in thanking them for
this wonderful conversely the privilege
talking to you good thank you very much
you
