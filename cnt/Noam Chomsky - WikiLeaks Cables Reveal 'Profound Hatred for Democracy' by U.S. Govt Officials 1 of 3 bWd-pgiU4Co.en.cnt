christena org the war and peace report
I'm Amy Goodman
we have lost David Lee investigations
that are at the Guardian he was speaking
to us from the busy newsroom there The
Guardian is doing an ongoing series of
pieces and expose is on these documents
they are being released slowly by the
various news organizations from The
Guardian in London to Der Spiegel in
Germany to El Pais in Spain to the New
York Times here in the United States for
reaction to the WikiLeaks documents
we're joined now by world-renowned
political dissident and linguist Noam
Chomsky professor emeritus at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
author of over a hundred books including
his latest hopes and prospects well
forty years ago Noam and the late
historian Howard Zinn helped government
whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg edit and
released the Pentagon Papers the top
secret internal US history of the
Vietnam War Noam Chomsky joins us now
from Boston it's good to have you back
again Noam why don't we start there
before we talk about WikiLeaks what was
your involvement with the Pentagon
Papers I don't think most people know
about this dan and I were friends Tony
Russo also who also prepared them and
helped leak them and I got advance
copies from Dan and Tony and I there
were several there were several people
who were releasing them to the press I
was one of them and then I along with
Howard goes in as you mentioned edited a
volume of essays and an index to the
papers so explain though how it worked
and I always think this is important to
tell the story especially for young
people Dan Ellsberg Pentagon official
top secret clearance gets this u.s.
involvement in Vietnam history out of
his safe he Xeroxes it and then how did
you get your hands on it he just
directly gave it to you from
dan and Dan Ellsberg Anthony Russo who
had done the xeroxing and the
preparation of the material yes did you
edit
well we didn't modify anything we the
the papers were not edited they're just
in their original form what Howard Zinn
and I did was they came out in four
volumes we prepared a fifth volume which
is critical essays by they're by many
scholars on the on the papers what they
mean their significance and so on and an
index which is almost indispensable for
using them seriously fifth volume in the
beacon press series you were then one of
the first people to see the Pentagon
Papers outside of Dan Ellsberg vicinity
Russo yes I mean there were some
journalists who may have seen them I'm
not sure so what are your thoughts today
as for example we just played this clip
of New York Republican Congress member
Peter King who says WikiLeaks should be
to Claire in a foreign terrorist
organization I think that's outlandish
the materials we should understand and
the Pentagon Papers is another case in
point that one of the major reasons for
government secrecy is to protect the
government from its own population in
the Pentagon Papers for example there
was there was one volume the
negotiations volume which might have had
bearing on ongoing activities and Dan
Ellsberg withheld that that came out a
little bit later but if you look at the
papers themselves they're things that
Americans should should have known that
the government didn't want them to know
and as far as I can tell from what I've
seen here are pretty much the same is
true
in fact the paper the current leaks are
what I've seen at least primarily
interesting because of what they tell us
about how the diplomatic service works
the documents revelations about Iran
come just as the Iranian government has
agreed to a new round of nuclear talks
beginning next month on Monday Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
the cables vindicate the Israeli
position that Iran poses a nuclear
threat Netanyahu said quote our region
has been hostage to a narrative that as
a result of 60 years of propaganda which
paints Israel is the greatest threat in
reality leaders understand that that
view is bankrupt for the first time in
history there's agreement that Iran is
the threat if leaders start saying
openly what they have long been saying
behind closed doors we can make a real
breakthrough on the road to peace
Netanyahu said Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton also discussed a run at
her news conference in Washington this
is what she said I think that it should
not be a surprise to anyone that Iran is
a source of great concern not only in
the United States that what comes
through in every meeting that I have
anywhere in the world is a concern about
Iranian actions and intentions so if
anything any of the the comments that
are being reported on allegedly from the
cables confirm the fact that Iran poses
a very serious threat in the eyes of
many of her neighbors and a serious
concern far beyond her region that is
why the international community came
together to pass the strongest possible
sanctions against Iran it did not happen
because the United States went out and
said please do this for us
it happened because countries once they
evaluated the evidence concerning Iran's
actions and intentions reached the same
conclusion that the United States
reached that we must do whatever we can
to muster the international community to
take action to prevent Iran from
becoming a nuclear weapons state so if
if anyone reading the stories about
these alleged tables thinks carefully
what they will conclude is that the
concern about Iran is well-founded
widely shared and will continue to be at
the source of the policy that we pursue
with like-minded nations to try to
prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear
weapons that was Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton yesterday a news
conference I wanted to get your comment
on hit on Clinton Netanyahu's comment
and the fact that Abdullah of Saudi
Arabia the King who's now getting back
surgery in New York called for the u.s.
to attack Iran Noam Chomsky that
essentially reinforces what I said
before that the main significance of the
cables that have been released so far is
what they tell us about a Western
leadership so Hillary Clinton and
Benjamin Netanyahu surely know of the
careful polls of Arab public opinion the
Brookings Institute just a few months
ago released extensive polls of what
Arabs think about Iran and the results
are rather striking they show that Arab
opinion does holds that the major threat
in the region is Israel that's 80
percent the second major threat is the
United States that's seventy seven
percent Iran is listed as a threat by 10
percent with regard to nuclear weapons
rather remarkably a majority in fact 57
percent say that the region will it
would have a positive effect
in the region if Iran had nuclear
weapons now these are not small numbers
80% 70% 77% say that the US and Israel
of the major threat 10% say that Iran is
a major threat now this may not be
reported in the newspapers here it is in
England but it's certainly familiar to
the Israeli and the US governments and
to the ambassadors but there isn't a
word about it anywhere but what that
reveals is the profound hatred for
democracy on the part of our political
leadership and of course the Israeli
political leadership these things aren't
even to be mentioned and this seeps its
way all through the diplomatic service
so the the cables don't have any
indication of that when they talk about
Arabs they mean the Arab dictators not
the population which is overwhelmingly
opposed to the conclusions that the case
that the analysts here Clinton and the
media has drawn there's also a minor
prop that is the major problem a minor
problem is that we don't know from the
cables of what the Arab leaders think
and say we know what was selected from
the range of what they say so there's a
filtering process we don't know how much
it distorts the information but there's
no question that what is a radical
distortion is or not even a distortion a
reflection of the concern that the
dictators are what matter the population
doesn't matter even if it's
overwhelmingly opposed to US policy this
shows up there are similar things
elsewhere so there's keeping to this
region one of the most interesting
cables was a cable from the US
ambassador in Israel to Hillary Clinton
which described the
as attack on Gaza which you should
follow us Israeli attack on Gaza
December 19 2008 it states that
correctly that there had been a truce it
does not add that during the truce which
was really not observed by Israel but
during the truce Hamas scrupulously
observed it according to the Israeli
government not a single rocket was filed
that's an omission but then comes a
straight lie it says that in December
2008 Hamas renewed rocket firing and
therefore Israel had to attack and the
self-defense
now the Ambassador surely is aware that
there must be somebody in the American
Embassy who reads the Israeli press the
mainstream Israeli press in which case
the embassy is surely aware that it's
exactly the opposite Hamas was calling
for a renewal of the ceasefire Israel
considered the offer and rejected it
preferring to bomb rather than to have
security also omitted is that while
Israel never observed the ceasefire it
maintained the siege and violation of
the truce agreement on November 4th the
US election 2008 the Israeli army
entered Gaza killed invaded Gaza and
killed half a dozen Hamas militants
which did lead to an exchange of fire in
which all the casualties as usual
Palestinian then in December Hamas when
they first officially ended Hamas called
for renewing it Israel refused and the
US and Israel chose to launch the war
what the embassy reported is a gross
falsification and a very significant one
since it has to do with the
justification for this murderous attack
which means either the embassy hasn't a
clue what's going on or else they're
lying outright
