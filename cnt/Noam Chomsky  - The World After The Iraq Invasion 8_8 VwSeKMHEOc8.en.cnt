perhaps especially if it's based on on
time production so there's to be any
feasible way to inspect them any one of
them could have a nuclear weapon in it
be put together in some you know New
York hotel room and it goes on and on
with threats like this I'm if you're
going to try to create a world where
people want to destroy you make a lot of
ways of doing and if a terrorist attack
takes place I think all bets are off
this is a very frightened country anyway
and if anything happens it could go
berserk do you consider I don't tax
resistance by Americans to be a an
appropriate means of expressing dissent
and possibly affecting transformation in
the government well I mean I was a tax
resistor myself for a long time in fact
i organized tried didn't work tried to
organize national tax resistance back in
nineteen sixty-five with a couple of
friends we really tried hard than get
very far and i myself kept after at it
for about ten years until i realized you
know it's just not an effective tactic
at that point these are tactical
questions you have to judge try to judge
is it going to reach people if you carry
out any form of civil disobedience
whether its tax resistance or something
else you have to ask you know what are
the likely consequences you I mean
you're not making a pact with god you're
trying to have an effect you know say
well what are the consequence is going
to be is it going to encourage other
people that do something say because
they'll see you're doing this and right
now my own you know I don't have any
faith in my tactical judgment yours is
better than mine i'm sure but if you
want mine it's that it's probably not an
effective device now frankly i think the
most important thing now is to change is
to do something about the fact that this
country is so terrified that an
unscrupulous leader can impose lunatic
ideas by a propaganda campaign that lead
the real dangers it seems to me that's
what we
we are we ought to also be dealing with
the fact that really critical and
important things are just not reaching
people like what happened last October's
say that have extraordinary importance
just one example unless that stuff is
known to people we not going to be able
to organize and have an effect and that
means fake breaking through media
monopolies information control doctrine
ation all sorts of things those dealing
with that seems to me a lot more
important than things like tax
resistance right now but it's your
guests thanks I really appreciate your
coming and I hope to see you back in the
area soon but my question was very
similar to hers actually but I wanted to
know your opinion given all the recent
events of the past few years worldwide
the opposition to some of the decisions
but the bush administration has made the
WTO violations if this invasion in Iraq
continues and becomes drawn out and you
know you can just go on to imagine what
could happen next you don't think
there's any chance for an international
crimes court to bring charges against
officials under the Bush administration
at this point in time for virtually none
Castillo is just too powerful and there
isn't enough internal opposition frankly
I'm amazed that the wars going on this
long I thought it would be over in two
days if you look at the relations of
violent means of violence and I'd still
suspect it's going to end very quickly
and but you know if it does drag on
there's going to be enormous protest and
it could be all sorts of things
happening I mean right now there's
tremendous anger and hatred all over the
world and it's probably going to
manifest itself in action but I don't
think in international
Court is in the cards and it doesn't
seem to me it's our concern really our
concern is to change this country no not
to speculate about what somebody else is
going to do I'm afraid this has got to
be the last question I'm afraid yeah
thank you
where you okay all right I'm Troy
Barrett and I'm from Boulder and what
brought you here this evening to hear no
I'm tonces because I've been a fan of
Noam Chomsky's for the 20 or so years
that I've been paying attention to
international human
inspired and also a gin drinker again
these troubled times surrounded by
people who care about musicians really
and what was the night for you
information is there anything
surprise you or struck you have an
evening
we can add to that information
or community community wise pretty on
top of the things that happen upward
position you very
I
a lot of surprises some of the facts
that that professor Chomsky stated were
new to me
and also some of the questions
like wesco connection
chris has to decide it would invade the
Netherlands
every time to try someone
that just shows
the extent that these guys are out of
touch with reality
and make sure that they
they maintain power issues that scared
me there was the star
walton professor Chomsky reinforce my
fears that I had back throughout the 80s
and 70s let's go up a little bit
is that ultimately we may all end in
nuclear annihilation that is so real of
the rent so
where to go with that is just to work
even harder to try and teach that what
happens his main message tonight to me
was change has to happen here
we have to become a true democracy and
active democracy and educated and
informed populace and so as I said
earlier today in a rally where I gave a
talk our task is huge it's to educate
people with the truth or good people in
this country but they have information
and that's that's what our job so I came
here to get some tools to go out and
educate
and get them to make better decisions
about this evening that particularly
struck you
I'm always
taken by the clarity
of what Chelsea hasn't said
it makes things very understandable
this is it in such act in such a way
that
not as heck mystic
it doesn't throw it at you it just gives
it to you a way that you can digest it
and there anything in particular that
you see yourself inspired to do that you
haven't been doing as a result of bigger
you can be honest yeah well I'm always
inspired to try to do more
you know I've written letters and I you
know
make phone calls
it's confusing I mean
it's really completion this is hard
the problem is over
hard to know which dress in return
it's a big plus
I always kind of gravitate to
the fact that we're not going to make
I'm not getting it on the media we're
not getting on the radio
I really think that if you can break
that barrier you can get venue yourself
and i know some people
look what would happen looking exactly
what
we were told that public opinion
exchange we
they would take matters into their
or sleeping inspire
tired it's hard road
and what brought you here this evening
tonight I came to see no attempt to
speak to citizens of Boulder because I
think that he shares my ideals and
values 12am lately I've been feeling
demoralized and hearing strong voice of
Noam Chomsky really makes me to feel
like there are people in the world who
believe in peace just like I do and
facts to back that up and that makes me
feel comforted in this difficult time
and as if that's enough is there
anything in particular that you feel
you're going to take in this evening and
we got into we're all going into your
personal life well just being surrounded
by about 2,000 people who live
remembering that I'm surrounded by
people in this community who share my
values
recorded with information that will
never be reported missing on the
mainstream
come and listen at the walkie
