well what are your thoughts on the
ongoing talks between John Kerry and
Sergey Lavrov on on the so-called Syrian
civil war charitable well that's a
really tragic situation in Syria is
simply launching it to suicide and it's
not easy to think of anything doable the
country is moving towards seem to be
moving towards partition the Kurdish
areas have become pretty much autonomous
Assad is left them alone now there's
battles going on between the Kurds and
the wide array of rebel forces there are
unified group and the Kurds have
gradually established and region where
they pretty much control it totally fact
they declared autonomy they'll probably
try to link themselves up with the Iraqi
Kurdistan but that's tricky because the
Barzani at the head of Iraqi Kurdistan
as opposed to the Syrian Kurds he's
trying to make a deal with Turkey for
all kind of economic reasons and a deal
with Turkey means suppressing the curves
the curves like was from South plenty of
internal battles and how that will work
out is not so loud that's one part of
Syria the rest is here is
partitioned there's a particles being
increasingly controlled by the Assad
forces backed by Iran Russia Hezbollah
of the other part is under the control
of the various rebel groups which are
fighting among themselves meanwhile the
Syrian people are being decimated just
devastated the huge number of refugees
the refugees are being the refugee issue
is a very striking issue since in situ
as discussed in the United States I mean
here we have what's called a huge
immigration problem you know they've got
these people coming in that why are they
coming so for example why where i live
in costs there's a big mayan community
these are people coming from Guatemala
over my Mayan highlands the wire they
come into the flee the country was the
region was gentle to live a genocidal
war which the u.s. supported Reagan was
a strong supporter of places destroys
and people flee come of the rich country
so it's illegal refugees we have to
deport them others are coming from
Mexico largely a result of NAFTA
predictable effect of naftogaz wipeout
Mexican agriculture roots of what
happens next okay so we have these
illegal immigrants Obama has broken all
records he's deported almost two billion
oh that's the u.s. there are other
countries like say Lebanon and Jordan
and Syria and Iran where they absorb
Precision's huge
Lebanon for example is the country four
million people it has about seven
hundred thousand palestinians but how
about a million Syrians okay for the
poor countries their special absorb
refugees actually absorbed the refugees
that we generate so the attack on Iraq
created nobody bose committee we're
going to have to mediate refugees okay
they're absorbed in the neighboring
countries like then Syria Jordan Brand
Lebanon that's their job their jobs to
absorb the refugees that we generate our
job is to drive out the refugees who we
generate and this is discussed is it's
not the enormity of this it doesn't even
begin to be discussed I mean maybe you
can't do much for Syria I felt a little
bit proposal but at least we can be
taken care of the refugees I mean this
is about a million of them in Lebanon
why should live in and support them we
should support them affect the battle in
syria is become a part of the growing
sunni-shia war around the whole region
event was inflamed by the united states
I mean in Iraq you know they've been
simmering conflicts but there was never
a sharp but as soon as she had conflict
until after the US invasion which
created it mount spread over the region
it's a devastating large parts of the
region we have a large errors
looking forward we're the ones that
should be supporting well that's these
are things you could do apart from that
if anybody has a suggestion I've heard
it in fact it wasn't only that makes any
sense is the luck barberini initiative
through the United Nations which Russia
has supported and my bet carrie has a
mildly sport it's a sin not easy to see
how it could work but there's no other
