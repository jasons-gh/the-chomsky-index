you
hi well let me begin with two recent
events both of them widely publicized
the first has to do with the famous
Salman Rushdie case a couple of days ago
you may have noticed the prime minister
of Iran suggested a very simple way to
resolve the crisis concerning Rushdie he
said he suggested that what should
happen is that all the copies of his
book Satanic Verses should simply be
burned and I guess the implication is
that if that happened then they could
cancel the death sentence that's one
case lots of coverage second case had to
do with an interesting thing that
happened here there was a what some
people are calling a mega merger of two
media giants time incorporated and
Warner Communications incorporated each
of them huge conglomerates and putting
coming together they form apparently the
biggest world the world's biggest media
empire now that also had a lot of
publicity even outside the business
pages and there was concern over the
effects of the merger is by increasing
me concentration so effectively the
effects on freedom of expression
well these two events are they seem
rather remote from one another and in a
sense they are but we can draw them
together by recalling an event which was
not considered important enough to be
reported but which I happened to know
about because I was personally involved
the title for this talk is you may have
noticed manufacturing consent political
economy the mass media that's actually
the title of a recent book that I was
co-author of with my co-authors Edward
Herman and the two of us have been
working together for many years we the
first our first book was published in
1974 book on American foreign policy in
the media and thing
was published by a publisher a textbook
publisher flourishing textbook publisher
which happened to be a subsidiary of
Warner Communications Incorporated
well that's a very rare person you never
saw that book and the reason was that
when the advertising for the book
appeared after 20,000 copies were
published one of the executives of
Warner Communications saw the
advertising and didn't like the feel of
it and asked to see the book and liked
it even less in fact was appalled and
then followed a many interaction which I
won't bother describing but the end
result of it was that the parent company
Warner communication simply decided to
put the publisher out of business and to
end the whole story that way now they
didn't burn the books they helped them
and which is more civilized also books
don't burn very well actually I'm told
now they're kind of like bricks but
pulping works and it wasn't just our
book that was eliminated it was all the
books published by that publisher well
there are a couple of differences
between this and the case of the prime
minister of Iran one difference is that
this was actually done not just
suggested the second difference is it
wasn't just one look it was all books
which happened to be tainted by being
published by the publisher who had done
this bad thing a third difference is the
reaction the reaction in the case of the
Warner Communications putting the
publisher out of business to prevent
them from publishing our book the
reaction to that was zero not because it
wasn't known it just was not considered
of any significance whereas the Rushdie
affair of course has had a huge furor as
it should and the Prime Minister's
proposal was greeted with ridicule and
contempt as a demonstration of what you
can expect from these barbarous people
so there are some differences well let's
go back to the question about the mega
merger would the will this new
Media Empire restrict freedom of
expression by excessive media
concentration possibly but the marginal
difference is slight given what already
exists as is perhaps illustrated by this
case now this is instantly not the only
case far from the only case which
illustrates how hypocritical and the
cynical the reaction to the Rushdie
affair is the reaction is legitimate but
we can ask the question whether it's
principled or not and if we look I think
we find that it's not well actually this
whole story that I've just told is kind
of misleading it's accurate in
identifying the locus of decision-making
power not only in publishing and in the
media but in political life and in
social life generally in that respect
it's accurate but it's very misleading
with regard to how that power is
typically exercised this is a very
unusual case I wouldn't want to suggest
that this is what happens typically it's
usually much more subtle than this but
no less effective and now I'm going to
come back to some of the more subtle
ways and the reasons for them and in
fact if there's time or maybe back in
discussion I'll talk about the aftermath
of this particular incident which is
also kind of illuminating in this
respect though more complex well with
that much as background let me turn to
the main topic manufacturing consent a
strange a topic and thought control and
indoctrination and so on now there's a
and and I'm gonna discuss how this
relates to thee to the media now there
is a standard view about the media and
the way they function the standard view
is expressed for example by Supreme
Court justice Powell when he describes
what he calls the crucial role of the
media in affecting the societal purpose
of the First Amendment that is enabling
the public to assert meaningful control
over the political process so the idea
is this is kind of an instrumental
defense of the First Amendment the value
to be achieved is the democratic process
and for the democratic process to
function
it's necessary for the public to have
free access open access to relevant
information and opinion and a wide range
of opinion and it's the job of the media
to ensure that and the First Amendment
has the instrumental function of
guaranteeing that this is served and the
media then do it that's the standard
view and notice it has a kind of a
descriptive component and also a
normative component it says is what the
media ought to be like and this is what
they are like
now that they ought to be this way seems
sort of obvious in fact kind of almost
tautological if democracy means has
something to do with the public having a
capacity to shape their own affairs
it obviously presupposes information and
that means the information system and
free society would have to serve this
function since it seems so obvious it's
worth bearing in mind that there is a
contrary view and in fact the country
review is very widely held in fact I
wouldn't be surprised if the contrary
view is the dominant view among people
over the last couple of centuries who
have thought about liberal democracy and
freedom and had a lot of function in any
event it's certainly a major position
this contrary view can be traced back to
the origins of modern democracy in the
17th century English revolution when for
the first time the there was a challenge
to the right of authority whether it was
the gentry or the king or whatever and
there was actually the beginnings of a
real radical democratic movement with a
commitment on the part of the people
involved were very widespread in England
to public involvement and control over
affairs they didn't want to be ruled by
the king they didn't want to be ruled by
Parliament they wanted to run their own
affairs and they were defeated the
Radical Democrats were defeated but not
before doing some important things which
had a lasting effect
well what I'm interested now is the
reaction to this the reaction to the
first efforts at popular democracy
radical democracy you might call it were
a good deal of fear and concern one
historian of the time Clement Walker
a warned that these guys who were
running putting out pamphlets on their
little printing presses and distributing
them and agitating in the army and you
know telling people how the system
really worked we're having an extremely
dangerous effect they were revealing the
mysteries of government and he said
that's dangerous
because it will unquote him it will make
people so curious and so arrogant that
they will never find humility enough to
submit to a civil rule and that's a
problem
john locke a couple of years later
explained what the problem was he said
day laborers and tradesmen the spinsters
and the dairymaids must be told what to
believe the greater part cannot know and
therefore they must believe and of
course someone must tell them what to
believe now there's a modern version of
and of course you just mean those
categories he meant the general public
there's a modern version of that this
goes all the way up to the modern times
it's discussing the American Revolution
and all the way through to the modern
period let's just come up to the
contemporary period now in last and in
the modern period you get a much more
sophisticated development of these ideas
so for example Reinhold Niebuhr is a
much respected Marla stand commentator
on world affairs
he wrote that rationality belongs to the
cool observers but because of the
stupidity the average man he follows not
reason but faith and this naive faith
requires that necessary
illusions be developed emotionally
potent oversimplifications have to be
provided by the mythmakers to keep the
ordinary person on course because of the
stupidity of the average man that's the
same view basically walter lippmann who
was the dean of American journalists is
the man who invented the phrase
manufacturer of consent
he described the manufacturer of consent
as a self-conscious art and a regular
organ of popular government this he said
is quite important this is a revolution
in the practice of democracy and he
thought it was a worthwhile revolution
the reason is again the stupidity the
average man the common interests he said
very largely elude public opinion
entirely and they can be managed only by
a specialized class whose personal
interests reach beyond the locality
that's Niebuhr school observers you can
guess who's part of them this is the
person who pronounces these views is
always part of that group it's the
others who want this this is in walter
Lippmann book public opinion which
appeared shortly after World War one and
the timing is important World War one
was a period in which the liberal
intellectuals John Dewey Circle
primarily were quite impressed with
themselves for their success as they
described in their own words for their
success in having imposed their will
upon a reluctant or indifferent majority
there was a problem in World War one the
problem was that the population was as
usual pacifistic and didn't see any
particular reason going out and killing
Germans and getting killed
the Europeans want to do that that's
their business and in fact Woodrow
Wilson won the 1960 16 election on a
mandate which was peace without victory
that's how he got elected and not
surprisingly he interpreted that as
meaning victory without peace and the
problem was to get this reluctant and
indifferent majority and get them to be
to create emotionally potent
oversimplifications and necessary
illusions so that they would then be
properly jingoistic and support this
great cause and the liberal
intellectuals were convinced that they
were the ones who had primarily
succeeded in doing this and they thought
it was a very good task for obvious
reasons and in fact they probably had
some role whether that as much role as
they think he could question but some
role they used all sorts of necessary
illusions for example fabrications a
hun atrocities Belgian babies with their
arms torn off and all sorts of things
that were concocted by the British
Foreign Service and fed to the educated
classes in the United States who picked
them up and were quite enthusiastic
about them and distributed them they
used such devices as what they called
historical engineering it was a phrase
proposed by Frederick Paxson an American
historian who was the founder of a group
called the National Board for historical
service that was a group of historians
who got together to serve the state by
explaining the issues of the war that we
might better win it that's historical
engineering the Wilson administration
established the country's I think first
official propaganda agency was called
the creel Commission which was dedicated
to convincing this reluctant or
indifferent majority that they better be
properly enthusiastic about the war that
they were opposed to that that had some
institutional consequences in fact there
were a number of institutional
consequences to this whole period one
was the institution of the National
political police FBI which has been
dedicated to thought control and
repression of freedom ever since that's
its primary activity and another
development institutional development
was the enormous growth of the public
relations industry a lot of people
learned lessons from the capacity to
control to control the public mind as
they put it
slogan of the public relations industry
one of the people who came out of the
creel Commission was a man named Edward
Bernays who became the patron saint of
the public relations industry that's a
big substantial industry which is
actually an American creation though
it's since spread throughout other parts
of the world it's dedicated to
controlling the public mind again
quoting its publications to educate the
American people about the economic facts
of life to ensure a favorable climate
for business and of course a proper
understanding of the common interests
Bernays developed the concept of engine
of consent which he said is the essence
of democracy that's and of course didn't
bother saying that there are only some
groups who were in a position to carry
out the engineering of consent those who
have the power and the resources he
himself showed how this was done
often by for example demonizing the
government of Guatemala the capitalist
democratic government we were planning
overthrow with a successful CIA coup he
was then working for the United Fruit
Company which was opposed to the
government because it was planning to
take over unused lands of the United
Fruit Company and hand them over to
landless peasants paying the rates that
the United Fruit Company had given as
their value for tax purposes which of
course they regarded as very unfair
because they had naturally been lying
and cheating about the value so that was
his achievement and that in fact the
public relations industry in general has
been dedicated to this project ever
since the creel Commission incidentally
is a predecessor of a contemporary
phenomenon that the Reagan
administration constructed it's their
office of Latin American public
diplomacy that's by far the largest
propaganda agency in American history
maybe one of the largest of any Western
government and it was also dedicated to
controlling the public mind it was
dedicated primarily to controlling the
debate and discussion over Central
America to demonizing the Sandinistas as
one of its officials put it and
mobilizing support for the u.s. terror
States in the region and it did it by
framing the debate by intimidating
critics by producing fabrications which
were then happily repeated by the media
and so for example one famous one just
to illustrate some of its achievements
when Ronald Reagan in 1986 read a
spectacular and effective speech which
convinced Congress to vote 100 million
dollars of aid for the Contras right
after the World Court had denounced the
United had condemned the United States
the unlawful use of force and called
upon it to end this aggression this
speech was extremely effective it
described all the in a whole litany of
Nicaraguan crimes and it ended up by
saying that these communists actually
concede that they are planning to
conquer the hemisphere and undermine us
all they themselves say that they are
carrying out a revolution without
borders
that was the peroration that's where he
ended up you know big excitement
Congress voted the aid of the Reagan
administration declared that this this
meant war this was a real war and
everybody was excited and happy now that
phrase revolution Without Borders
actually had already been used it had
been used by a State Department pamphlet
that was called revolution Without
Borders describing Sante mystic crimes
and there's actually a version of that
phrase that exists the phrase is a
appears or something like it appears in
a speech by sandanista commandant a
Thomas Burke a he had given speech in
which he said that the Nicaraguan the
Sandinistas hoped to construct a kind of
a model society a society which will be
which will work so well and will serve
the needs of the poor so well that
others will be inclined to try to do the
same thing for themselves and he went on
to say there that every country has to
every country has to carry out its own
revolution there's no way for one
country to make a revolution somewhere
else but the model that the Sandinistas
are constructing he hoped was be so
successful that others would want to do
it and he said in this sense our
revolution transcends borders
well that phrase was immediately picked
up by the office of public diplomacy and
turned into a threat to conquer the
hemisphere that fraud was at once
exposed by the Council on hemispheric
affairs which sends out a weekly news
analysis in Washington that journalists
read it was even expose it was even
mentioned in the Washington Post
somewhere in the back pages they noted
that the phrase revolution Without
Borders was not
exactly what he had said like nothing to
do was the opposite of what he had said
but that didn't make any difference the
phrase was useful the construction was
useful and since then the media and and
when the State Department document came
out there was no criticism of it when
Reagan made the speech nobody pointed
out that this was a fabrication even the
Washington Post which it exposed it
referred to the Sandinista revolution
without borders
the media have repeatedly have repeated
this over and over again look they say
themselves that they're gonna have a
revolution without borders and so on
well that's the kind of thing that's
done by an effective propaganda agency
of course if the media are willing to go
along because it wasn't very hard to
figure out that this was a incredible
fraud well that's the kind of thing that
was done all of these operations were
completely illegal there was a
congressional report done on them
general Gao report which pointed out
that of course they were illegal they
were run out of the national security
council and not allowed the propaganda
as Americans but it was very successful
when this was exposed during the
iran-contra hearings one top of
administration official described the
activities of the office of public
diplomacy is one of the really great
achievements it was a he said a
spectacular success he described it as
the kind of operation that you carry out
an enemy territory and that's quite an
appropriate phrase I think the phrase
expresses exactly the way in which the
public is viewed by people with power
it's an enemy it's a domestic enemy and
you got to keep it under control
and you have to make sure that the
mysteries are not revealed so that the
people don't become so curious and
arrogant that they refuse to submit to a
civil rule to put it in
seventeenth-century terms and to control
that domestic enemy propaganda and
fabrications and so on are important and
that's what the public relations
industry is for for corporate purposes
and what what the media are for if they
properly serve the state well that's
notice again we have a view that says
the media should not function the way
the standard Reder
claims there's also an academic twist to
this it's come closer to home if you go
back to the international encyclopedia
of Social Sciences published in 1930
three days when people were a little
more open and honest and what they said
there's an article on propaganda and
it's well worth reading there's an entry
under propaganda the entry is written by
a leading one maybe the leading American
political scientist Harold Lasswell was
very influential particularly in this
area communications and so on and in
this entry in the International
encyclopedia on propaganda he says we
should not succumb to democratic
dogmatism 'he's about men being the best
judges of their own interests they're
not he said even with the rise of mass
education doesn't mean that people can
judge their own interests they can't the
best judges of their interests are
elites the specialized class the cool
observers the people who have
rationality and therefore they must be
granted the means to impose their will
notice for the common good because again
because well he says because of the
ignorance and superstition of the masses
he said it's necessary to have a whole
new technique of control largely through
propaganda propaganda he says we
shouldn't have a negative connotation
about it's neutral propaganda says is as
neutral as a pump handle you can use it
for good you can use it for bad since
we're good people obviously that's sort
of true by definition we'll use it for
good purposes and there should be no
negative connotations about that in fact
it's moral to use it because that's the
only way that you can save the ignorant
and stupid masses of the population from
their own errors now you don't let a
three-year-old run across the street and
you don't let ordinary people make their
own decisions you have to control them
and why do you need propaganda well he
explains that he says in military run or
feudal societies what we would these
days call totalitarian societies you
don't really need propaganda that much
and the reason is you got a you've got a
club in your hand you can control the
way people behave and therefore it
doesn't matter much what they think
because if they get out
line you can control them for their own
good of course but once you lose the
club you know once the state loses its
capacity to coerce by force then you
have some problems the voice of the
people is heard you got it all these
formal mechanisms around that permit
people to express themselves and even
participate and vote and that sort of
thing
and you can't control them by force
because you lost that capacity but the
voice of the people is heard and ever
you got to make sure it says the right
thing in order to make sure it says the
right thing you got to have effective
and sophisticated propaganda again for
their own good so in as a society
becomes more free that is there's less
capacity to coerce it simply needs more
sophisticated indoctrination and
propaganda for the public good
the similarity between this and Leninist
ideology is very striking
according to Leninist ideology the cool
observers the radical intelligentsia
will be the vanguard who will lead the
stupid and ignorant masses onto you know
communist utopia because they're too
stupid to work it out by themselves and
in fact there's been a very easy
transition over these years between one
and the other position and it's very
striking that continually people move
from one position to the other very
easily and I think the reason for the
ease is partly because there's sort of
the same position so you can be either a
Marxist Leninist commissar or you can be
somebody celebrating the magnificence of
state capitalism and you can serve those
guys it's more less the same position
you pick one of the other depending on
your estimate of where power is and that
can change the in fact the mainstream of
the intelligentsia I think over the last
say through the century
have tended to be in one of the other
camp either there's a strong appeal of
Marxism Leninism to the intelligentsia
for obvious reasons the bother saying
and there's the same appeal of these
doctrines to the intelligentsia because
it puts them in the position of
justifying of having a justified role as
ideological managers in the service of
real power
corporate and state power for the public
good of course so you naturally
attempted the one of the other position
well going on to the post Second World
War period the same ideas continued to
be expressed for example in 1948 when it
was again necessary to drive the
reluctant and indifferent majority to a
new war fever remember 1948 the war was
over everybody was pacifistic they
wanted to go home and buy refrigerators
and so on
they don't want anymore Wars they wanted
to demobilize we were done with that
stuff but they had to be whipped up into
a war fever because there was a new war
coming along the Cold War which was a
real war as as the internal documents
explained and it was necessary to
bludgeon them into belief in the demands
of the Cold War's Dean Acheson put it
the presidential well-known historian
presidential historian Thomas Bailey
explained in 1948 that because the
masses are notoriously short-sighted and
generally cannot see danger until it is
at their throats our state our statesmen
are forced to deceive them into an
awareness of their own long-run
interests deception of the people may in
fact be income increasingly necessary
unless we are willing to give our
leaders in Washington a freer hand in
other words if we continue this nonsense
of trying to control them through
elections and that sort of thing it's
going to be necessary to have deception
of the people because the masses are too
stupid and ignorant to understand the
danger that's at their throat and that's
the role of the media to carry out the
appropriate deception coming up to the
present or near present in 1981 when we
were launching a new crusade for freedom
in Central America
Samuel Huntington who was a professor of
government at Harvard and a longtime
government adviser explained in a
discussion in the Harvard Journal
international security that you may have
to sell intervention or other military
action in such a way as to create the
misimpression that it is the Soviet
Union you're fighting that's what the
United States has done ever
since the Truman Doctrine and that's
what of course we're now doing we're
fighting Nicaragua but we've got to
create the misimpression that it's the
Soviet Union that you're fighting that's
the job of the office of Latin American
public diplomacy and of the cool
observers and of respectable
intellectuals and of the media and so on
actually that remark of his is quite
accurate and gives a certain insight
into the Cold War and also the modern
period
well these concerns about controlling
the public mind rather typically they
arise in the wake of periods of war and
turmoil there's a reason for that wars
and depressions and such things they
have a way of arousing people from
apathy and making them think and
sometimes even organize and that raises
all of these dangers so for example
Wilson Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare a very
harsh and effective repression
immediately followed World War one and
that's when you get the this revolution
in the art of democracy about the need
for manufacture of consent and you get
the FBI to really do the job properly by
force if necessary as they did McCarthy
what we call McCarthyism which is a poor
label because it was actually initiated
by the Liberal Democrats in the late
1940s and picked up and exploited by
McCarthy but what we call McCarthyism
was a similar effort to to overcome the
the energizing effect of the war and the
depression in mobilizing the population
and causing them to challenge the to
reveal the mysteries of government and
do all these bad things and after the
Vietnam War the same thing happened the
Vietnam War was one fact or a major
factor in fact in causing the ferment of
the 1960s and that caused a lot of
concern deep concern which still exists
incidentally because they haven't been
able to overcome it the Vietnam the the
60s created what liberal elites called a
crisis of democracy that's the title of
a quite important book on all of these
topics the first and in fact only book
length publication of the trilateral
commission published in 1975
the crisis of democracy it's about the
problem of governability of democracies
and there was a problem of the
governability of democracies because
people were getting out of hand the
domestic enemy was getting out of
control and something had to be done
about it the trilateral commission puts
together liberal corporate and state
elites from the three major centers of
state capitalism Western Europe the
United States and Japan that's why the
trilateral and it is the liberal elites
this is the group around Jimmy Carter
it's where he came from in fact and
virtually all of his cabinet and top
advisors
it's that segment of opinion the
American reporter they gave the report
and he meant for the United States was
again Samuel Huntington and he pointed
out that Truman had been able to govern
the country with the cooperation of a
relatively small number of Wall Street
lawyers and bankers then there was no
crisis of democracy that's the way
things were supposed to be and sorry
this kind of vulgar Marxist rhetoric is
not untypical of internal documents in
the government or in the business press
and so on and this was intended to be an
internal document they didn't really
expect people to read it but it's worth
reading
I'm sure the library has it they should
the but but now this crisis democracy it
erupted what had happened was during the
1960's all sorts of segments of the
population that are normally apathetic
and passive and obedient and don't get
in the way
sudden began it began to become
organized and vocal and raised questions
and press their demands in the political
arena and that caused an overload it
caused a crisis of democracy you
couldn't just govern the country with a
few Wall Street lawyers and bankers any
longer you had all these other pressures
coming from the general population and
that's a problem
and we got to overcome the problem and
the way to overcome the problem they
said all three the whole group is to
introduce more moderation and democracy
to mitigate the
excess of democracy that means in short
to return the general population to
their apathy and passivity and the
obedience which becomes them that's the
stupid and ignorant masses have to be
kept out of trouble and when you get
these crises a democracy you got to
restore the norm that we had before well
that's a view that goes right back to
the origins of the Republic if you read
the sayings of the founding fathers you
will discover that that was essentially
their view as well
they also regarded the public as a
dangerous threat the way the country
ought to be organized as John Jay put it
the president of the Constitutional
Convention and the first Supreme Court
Chief Justice Supreme Court his one of
his favorite Maxim's according to his
biographer was that those who run who
those who own the country ought the
government and if they can't govern it
by force they gotta govern it another
way and that ultimately requires a
deception propaganda indoctrination of
the manufacture of consent well let me
summarize there's a standard view
rhetorical view standard view and
rhetoric is basically that of Justice
Powell the public ought to exert
meaningful control over the political
process and it's the role of the media
to allow them to do it
that's the rhetoric there's a contrary
view which is that the public is a
dangerous enemy and it has to be
controlled for its own good and that
contrary view is very widely held in
fact I wouldn't be surprised if it's the
dominant view among sophisticated
commentators on political theory going
back to the 17th century Democratic
commentators so we got these two views
counter posed well with regard to the
media turning to the media the standard
view is again the one I just described
by Justice Powell they after the media
have to serve gonna serve the societal
purpose of the First Amendment that be
free and open and so on and then the
descriptive part of that is that that's
exactly what they do that view is
expressed for example by Judge Gurfein
in in a important case where he
permitted the New York Times
published the Pentagon Papers 1971 or to
gar fines decision says that we have a
cantankerous press an obstinate press a
ubiquitous press and it must be suffered
by those in authority in order to
preserve the even greater values of
freedom of expression and the right of
the people to know so granted the press
is a nuisance but it's important to
allow it to maintain its adversarial and
cantankerous ways because even you know
it serves an even higher purpose well at
that point we begin to have a debate the
debate is between the people who say
that the media are cantankerous and
adversarial and so on and they've gone
too far we got to do something to
control them and constrain them in fact
the trilateral commission liberals also
suggested that they said the media have
gone much too far in their adversarial
ways and we have to if they can't
regulate themselves probably the
government will have to step in and
regulate them that's on the liberal side
on the reactionary side of course it's
much harder you know harsher ideas come
along so you have that you have that the
one side says that we've got to curb the
press they're too cantankerous and then
you've got the spokesman for free speech
judge Gurfein and so on they say no no
it's we agree they're pretty bad but
you've got to allow them to do this
because of the higher purposes well
that's the debate and if you look over
that there is a good deal of discussion
of the media and that's the way it's
framed assumption the media have our
adversarial cantankerous independent and
then then maybe even so much that
they're threatening democracy and then
comes the question should we let them
get away with it
or should we curb them and the advocates
of free speech say sorry you gotta let
them get away with it
and the others say no there's other
values that are more important like the
govern ability of the country and so on
so we got to stop them well outside the
spectrum of debate there's another view
the other view says that the factual
assumption is wrong the factual
assumptions taken for granted and not
even argued is just wrong
according to this alternative view the
media do fulfill a societal purpose but
it's quite a different one the societal
purpose is exactly what is advocated by
the elite view that I've described the
society inculcate and defend the
economic and social and political agenda
of particular sectors privileged groups
that dominate the domestic society those
that own the society and therefore ought
to govern it and they do this in all
kind of ways they do it by selection of
topics by distribution of concerns by
the way they frame issues by the way
they filter information by the way they
tell lies like about revolutions without
borders by emphasis and tone all sorts
of ways the most crucial of which is
just the bounding of debate what they do
is say here's the spectrum of
permissible debate and within that you
can have a great controversy but you
can't go outside it the right-wing
continually claims the press has a
liberal bias and there's some truth to
that but they don't understand what it
means the liberal bias is extremely
important in a system of pret enough in
a sophisticated system of propaganda
that there ought to be a liberal bias
the liberal bias says thus far and no
further on as far as you can go and look
how liberal I am and of course it turns
out that I accept without question all
the presuppositions of the propaganda
system notice that that's a beautiful
type of system you don't ever express
the propaganda that's vulgar and too
easy to penetrate you just presuppose it
unless you accept the presuppositions
you're not part of the discussion and
the presuppositions are instilled not by
being beating over the head with them
but just by making them the foundation
of discussion you don't accept them
you're not in the discussion so in the
cases that say the Vietnam War which was
you know major topic of debate if you
look over the media there was a big
debate over the Vietnam War there were
the Hawks who said that if we continue
to fight harder and we're more violent
and so on and so forth then we can
achieve the noble end of defending South
Vietnam and free people of South Vietnam
from communist
and then there were the dugs who said
it's probably not going to work and it's
probably not going to be - it's going to
be too bloody and it's going to cost us
too much and therefore we're not going
to be able to achieve the noble end of
defending the people of South Vietnam
from communism now again there's another
view and that is that we were attacking
South Vietnam and that other view has
the merit of being true obviously true
but it was inexpressible that's outside
the spectrum of debate you can enter the
debate only if you accept the assumption
and if you check the media over the
entire period as far as I can see I've
Herman and I on this book review the
media from about 1950 to the present on
Indochina and I don't think you can find
an exception to this I mean even
statistical error that's the spectrum
you got to accept and the same is true
and there's a liberal bias in the sense
that towards the end of the war like by
about 1969 or 1970 after Wall Street had
turned against the war then you got a
preponderance of dubs saying probably
aren't going to succeed in defending
freedom and democracy in South Vietnam
the country that we're attacking well
that's this this this conception of the
media which noticed challenges the
factual assumptions of the entire debate
that says that the media function in the
way that Herman and I called the
propaganda model in this same book they
function in accord with a propaganda
model now propaganda sounds like a bad
word but remember that in more honest
days like in international encyclopedia
of social science propaganda was
considered a perfectly good word and in
fact something that we ought to have
more of it because it's needed for the
reasons that last well explained well
notice that the propaganda model has
lots of predictions it predicts the way
the media are going to behave and you
can test those predictions but it also
has a prediction of that's kind of
reflexive about the propaganda model
itself it predicts that the propaganda
model can't be taken seriously there's a
reason for that if you think it through
the propaganda model states that the
debate has got to be within assumptions
that are serviceable to powerful
interests and the propaganda model
challenges those those assumptions so
therefore it's got to be out of the
debate
okay that prediction is instantly very
well confirmed it is outside the debate
so that one bit of positive evidence for
the propaganda model notice incidentally
that this model has a kind of a
disconcerting feature to it if you think
about it obviously the claims of the
propaganda model are either valid or
invalid if they're invalid we can
dismiss them if they're valid we have to
dismiss them right so one way or another
you're gonna be sure that this model
isn't going to be discussed and that's
in fact true
well now the basic questions from this
point on are factual is the factual
assumption that bounds of debate correct
or is it wrong that's a factual
assumption you can study and the real
topic you know the topic that ought to
be investigated is that now there isn't
time to do that now so I'll just make a
couple of comments about it and give a
few illustrations three comments first
first notice that the propaganda model
has a number of features one feature
that it has is that it's advocated by
elites that's that is it's the it
conforms with the normative opinion the
proposal that the public is dangerous
you've got there
you got to ensure that they don't get
out of control they have to be
controlled by deception and propaganda
since you don't have the means to do it
by force and the propaganda model simply
says well yeah they work the way elites
say they ought to work so one point
about the propaganda model is that in
fact it's it has elite advocacy a second
point about the propaganda model is that
it's it's got a kind of prior
plausibility in fact it's almost natural
on completely uncontroversial
assumptions if you look at the structure
of the society you don't predict the
propaganda model without even looking at
the facts why is that true
well simply ask yourself what the major
media are now the way the media work
there are some media which kind of set
the agenda you know the most important
ones like the New York Times in the
Washington Post big national media they
set the agenda if the government wants a
story to get into television that
evening what it does is leak it to get
into the front page of The Washington
Post in New York Times on the assumption
the television will pick it up and say
okay that's important so we'll give
the front news the same is true of
national television it sets its you know
sets the agenda that makes people think
the New York Times front page is sent
over the wire services the afternoon of
the day before there's a thing if you
read the you know you look at that stuff
that's ground out of the AP wire you'll
notice around four o'clock come
something that says the New York Times
front page tomorrow is going to look
like so-and-so well if you're a an
editor of a journal in some small town
you read it so that's what the important
news is and you frame your own reporting
that way you know it's not percent but
there is a kind of an agenda setting
media New York Times Washington Post the
three television channels a few others
that participate to some extent in this
well ask yourself what those
institutions are answer those
institutions are first of all major
corporations some of the biggest
corporations in the country furthermore
they're integrated with and in many
cases owned by even larger corporations
you know like General Electric and so on
so what you have is major corporations
and conglomerates now like other
corporations they sell a product to a
market the market in this case is
advertisers that's what keeps them alive
the product is audiences they sell
audiences to advertisers in fact for the
major media they try to sell privileged
audiences to advertisers that raises
advertising rates and those are the
people are trying to reach anyway so
what you have is businesses corporations
which are selling relatively privileged
audiences to other businesses well just
ask yourself the natural question what
do you expect to come out of this
interaction major corporations selling
privileged audiences to other
corporations what would you expect to
come out of it on no further assumptions
is an interpretation of the world that
reflects the interests and the needs of
the sellers the buyers and the product
that wouldn't be very surprising in fact
it'd be kind of surprising if it weren't
true
so on relative and that of course may
the propaganda model so what you expect
on relatively uncontroversial sort of
free-market assumptions with nothing
else said is that you'll get the media
will function and accord with the
propaganda model now if you look more
closely there are many other factors
which interact to lead to the same
expectation the ideological managers the
editors and the colonists and the you
know the anchor men and all that stuff
there are very privileged people there
wealthy privileged people whose
associations and interests and concerns
reflow slee related to those of the
groups that dominate the economy and
that dominate the state and in fact is
just a constant flow and interaction
among all those groups they're basically
the same group they're ultimately the
people who own the country are the ones
who serve their interests and again it
wouldn't be terribly surprising to
discover that these people share the
perceptions and concerns and feelings
and interests and you know attitudes of
their associates and the people they're
connected with and the people whose
positions they aspire to take when they
move on to the next job and so on and so
forth
again that wouldn't be very surprising
and on and on I won't proceed there are
many other factors which tend in the
same direction well that's my second
point second point is that the
propaganda model has a kind of prior
plausibility a third point which is not
too well-known is that the propaganda
model is assumed to be true by most of
the public that is in polls country to
what you hear it when when people are
asking polls you know what you think
about the media and so on the general
reaction is there to conformist the two
subservient to power you know they're
too obedient
that's the either plurality or sometimes
even majority view the and they're not
critical enough of government for
example that's the standard view well we
have three observations now the
propaganda model has elite advocacy that
is elites believe that's the way it
ought to be the media oughta be it has
prior plausibility it's very plausible
on uncontroversial free-market
assumptions and it's accepted as valid
by a large part probably the majority of
the population
those three facts don't prove that it's
valid of course but they do suggest that
it might be part of the discussion it's
not it's off the agenda exactly as the
propaganda model itself predicts that's
interesting that's an interesting
collection of facts well what about the
factual matter of how they media behave
on this there are by now literally
thousands of pages of documentation
detailed documentation case studies and
so on which have put the model that to a
test in the harshest ways than anybody
can dream up I'll talk about some of the
ways of doing it later or you know in
discussion if you want but I think it's
been subjected to quite a fair test in
fact a very harsh test there's no
challenge to it as far as I know if
there is I've missed it
the few cases where there's any
discussion of it the level of argument
is so embarrassingly bad that just tends
to reinforce the implausibility of the
model in fact I think it's fair to say
that this is one of the best confirmed
theses in the social sciences but in
accord with its predictions it's off the
agenda
you can't even discuss it well what I
ought to do now is what has to be done
in a course actually not in a talk and
that is to turn to cases you know method
you know ask how you could test it what
the results are and so on and there's
plenty of material in print and more
coming out in which we can check and see
whether you're convinced that in fact
it's plausible or accurate my feeling as
it is I'll just give a couple of
illustrative cases and let me stress
that I do this with some reluctance
because the illustrative cases are
misleading they suggest that maybe it's
a sporadic phenomenon in fact when
somebody gives you a couple of cases you
rightly ask whether there are an
adequate sample you know maybe they were
just selected to work so you ought to be
suspicious about isolated cases that's
why the model has in fact been tested
for many approaches but that misleading
necessity aside because I can't do more
than that let me give you a couple of
cases to illustrate the kind of thing I
think you will find if you pursue the
question of fact let's take something
that you'd certainly expect the media to
be concerned with namely freedom of
press
they got a professional interest in that
and in fact there's a good deal of
discussion of freedom of press in the
media in the just keeping just to the
last decade the problems of the press in
repressive societies has been very
widely discussed many examples the the
case that has been by far the most
discussed in fact I suspect it has been
discussed more than all questions of
media freedom of the press throughout
the entire world during this period is
the one newspaper in Latin America that
99% of the literate population would be
able to name if they were asked to name
a newspaper in Latin America namely La
Prensa in Nicaragua
there has been an overwhelming amount of
reporting on the tribulations of La
Prensa in Nicaragua one media analyst
Francisco Goldman who studied the
freedom of press in these countries
pointed out that in four years he found
about 260 references to this in the New
York Times that's an incredible amount
of coverage I'm sure I don't think
anybody's done the study but try it and
if anybody wants I'm sure you'll find
that this is more coverage than has been
given to problems all other problems
with the freedom of press combined all
over the world probably by a
considerable factor anyhow that's the
one you know that's the famous case and
this coverage has been very irate and
angry because of the tribulations of La
Prensa for example when let's go back to
the moment when Ronald Reagan succeeded
in convincing Congress to vote a hundred
million dollars in aid so that we'd have
a war a real war in violation of the
demand of the World Court that the
United States consider its stop
terminate its unlawful aggression right
after that after the government
announced that now we finally got a war
a real war the government of Nicaragua
suspended La Prensa and that caused
tremendous outrage in the United States
there's a group of the distinguished
group of journalism fellows at Harvard
the Nieman Foundation and they
immediately gave their award for the
year to Violeta Chamorro
the editor of La Prensa to express their
solidarity with her in this moment of
crisis and to show how deeply committed
they are to freedom of the press
The Washington Post had an editorial
right after that called newspaper of
Valor in which they said Violeta
Chamorro should receive ten awards not
one award the New York Review of Books
had an article by left-liberal
correspondent Murray Kempton appealing
to people to contribute funds to keep
the foot you know prints alive during
this period those funds could then be
added on to the CIA subvention that had
kept the journal going since the Carter
Administration in 1979 right after the
Sandinista revolution succeeded and in
fact in general there was great frenzy
and hysteria about this terrible attack
on freedom of the press well let's look
a little more closely first of all what
is laprincia laprincia is a journal
which calls for the overthrow of the
government of Nicaragua by a foreign
power which funds it and which is trying
to overthrow the government of Nicaragua
it's an interesting fact you might check
the history of the West to see whether
there's ever been any such thing for
example you might ask whether a major
newspaper in the United States the
wealthiest newspaper in the United
States was funded by the Nazis in 1943
calling for the overthrow of the
government of the United States and you
might ask yourself what would have
happened if that was possible well you
can get the answer very quickly even
tiny little newspapers which weren't
funded by anybody and that raised
questions about conscientious objection
and so on they were censored and
controlled and suppressed and so on
during the first world war was even more
vicious we didn't actually put a
presidential candidate in jail for ten
years after the first world war because
he had he had declared opposition to the
draft the the so the in fact there's
nothing comparable to this in the
history of the West anymore and in world
history altogether all right now La
Prensa is described in the United States
as the Journal that supposed Simoes
in fact there was a journal called La
Prensa which did oppose the Somoza
regime courageously its editor was in
fact murdered and had the same name as
this journal of Prensa and it's
described as the same journal but is
that true well it's a little tricky at
this point certainly has the same name
in 1980 the owners of La Prensa decided
to convert the journal into a government
into a journal dedicated to the
overthrow of the government at that
point they fired the editor the brother
of the editor who had been murdered
under Somoza and there was a split in
the staff
80% of the staff left with the editor
and formed the new journal in Leyva the
audio which is the successor of the old
La Prensa at least if a newspaper is
defined by its editor and its staff not
of course if it's defined by the money
that's behind it supplied by the CIA
then you have a different answer to
what's the old La Prensa and that
incidentally is also something that's
never discussed but suppose that's true
let's suppose it's just a CIA journal
and in fact that there's no parallel to
it in history of the West all that being
true calling for the overthrow of the
government funded by the outside power
superpower that is trying to overthrow
the government well nevertheless a true
civil libertarian would defend La Prensa
from harassment I think somebody really
believes in civil liberties should say
yes England should have permitted the
press to be dominated by Nazi Germany in
1942 and if they didn't do it that shows
they don't believe in freedom that's the
position of a real civil libertarian and
that's the position of the American
intellectual community with regard to La
Prensa and now at this point we ask the
obvious question is this passionate
commitment to freedom of the press
based on libertarian enthusiasms and
passions or is it based on service to
the state well as a way of answering
that question in fact we all know the
way of answering that question it's a
question that we regularly ask or don't
even bother asking because the answer is
so obvious when we look at propaganda of
our enemies so you take a look at the
productions of state
World Peace Council which is a communist
front peace organization or the East
German Peace Committee you know the
government Peace Committee you read that
material and you'll find that there's
all sorts of descriptions they're
generally valid descriptions of crimes
and atrocities and repression in the
United States are committed by the
United States and its agents and so on
and great outrage over these horrors
often that materials accurate and often
in fact it's material it's not recorded
here well do we praise them for their
you know libertarian passions no we
first ask a question we ask how do they
deal with repression and atrocities
carried out but Soviet Union in its
clients where they are the ones they're
responsible for well as soon as we get
the answer to that question we dismiss
the whole story with contempt and
ridicule properly even if there are
charges are accurate that's a fair test
and we ought to have the honesty to
apply the same tests to ourselves so
let's do it we now ask the same question
about the defenders of Liberty of press
in the case of La Prensa the New York
Times The Washington Post New York
Review of Books the educated community
and so on the Nieman fellows and so on
how do we test that well we look at same
test we look at cases of repression of
freedom of the press in our domains and
we ask how they've reacted and there are
many such cases very close by in fact so
take el Salvador El Salvador had
independent newspapers at one time
doesn't have many longer these were not
newspapers funded by a foreign power
trying to overthrow the government of El
Salvador they were not newspaper
supporting the guerrillas in fact they
were mildly liberal newspapers calling
for mild reforms like land reform and
things like that raising questions about
the concentration of land and so on
those newspapers don't exist any longer
they were not censored and they were not
harassed rather another technique was
used by the government that we installed
trained directed and armed the technique
was in the case of one newspaper the
security forces picked up an editor and
a photo journalist in a sense Alva door
restaurant took them outside cut them to
pieces with machetes and left the minute
the owner then fled that took care one
newspaper without censorship the second
newspaper it took a couple of bombing
attempts three assassination attempts
finally the military that we trained
support and armed surrounded the
premises of the newspaper entered it
smashed the place up at that point the
editor fled that took care of the second
newspaper so that's the end of the Free
Press in El Salvador well now he asked
the question where how would did the
American press respond to this well that
was actually investigated by fair
fairness and accuracy in reporting the
media monitoring organization they
checked eight I guess was eight years of
the New York Times to see what there had
been what had been said about this well
it turns out that was not one word in
the news columns of the New York Times
about this I checked editorials there
was not one phrase and the editorials
about this in fact the only reference to
that to these two things in the New York
Times was that the editor of one of the
journals who fled was allowed an op-ed
in which he described what had happened
and that's important because it means
all the civil libertarians knew about it
the ones who read the New York Times
like the Neiman fellows and the editors
in New York Review and the editors of
New York they all knew about it it just
wasn't important enough to report or to
comment on well that tells you where the
commitment to freedom of the press is
turn to the neighboring country of
Guatemala there are - there was no
censorship they took care of freedom of
the press by simply murdering about 50
journalists in the early 80s including
people you know journalists murdered the
right when they were on radio and
television announcing somehow that took
care of freedom of the press without any
censorship virtually no discussion a few
words here and there well now this but
this was a government we supported that
we supported remember supported
enthusiastically with that government
supposed to now be a democracy they had
an election that we all proudly hail and
so on and after the democracy was
established one of the editors who had
fled returned as his last year just a
year ago to try to open a small
newspaper again wasn't funded by foreign
power you know it wasn't calling for the
overthrow the government nothing like
that just a small very small
limited capital sort of left liberal
newspaper la epoca it was called he as
soon as he came back to the country the
death squads which are just adjuncts of
the security forces threatened him with
death if he didn't leave the country but
he continued he started up the newspaper
it ran a couple of issues then fifteen
armed men surely from the security
services broke into the offices firebomb
them destroyed the premises kidnapped
the night watchmen
the editor called a press conference the
next day in which he announced that
there this shows that there can't be any
freedom of the press and the so-called
democracy of Guatemala some members of
European press it came I don't think any
American reporter came there was he then
he then received another death threat
warning him to flee the country or be
killed he did flee the country was taken
to the airport by a Western ambassador
so they wouldn't be killed along the way
and he went back into exile in Mexico
well how much coverage did that one get
in the New York Times in the Washington
Post which of the two that I checked the
amount of coverage was zero not a word
about it and it's not that they didn't
know it they did know it and you can
prove that they knew it because if you
look in a small print you'll find
oblique references to it so for example
in the culture section of the New York
Times a couple of weeks later there's a
report if somebody went down to some you
know meeting in Mexico and he met this
guy and he sort of refers to the facts
so they knew about it just wasn't
important enough to report all right
let's take the other major client of the
United States in fact the major client
of the United States the State of Israel
that's the major subsidized country of
the United States so you want to find
out what American elites think about
freedom of the press let's take a look
at the way they react to freedom of the
press in Israel now here history was
kind enough to set up some controlled
experiments for us the literally the
week let's go back to the week when la
prensa was suspended remember right
after the United States had declared war
against Nicaragua as the administration
said in violation of the World Court
ruling and they suspend that this
newspaper funded by the United States
and calling for the overthrow of the
government
well that just right then Israel closed
two newspapers in Jerusalem two
newspapers in Jerusalem were closed
permanently it's not the first time that
had happened the case went to the
Supreme Court Israeli Supreme Court and
the Supreme Court ruled that it was
legitimate to close the two newspapers
because the security services had
claimed that without providing any
evidence because they don't have to that
these newspapers were funded by hostile
elements which presumably means the PLO
and the court declared High Court
declared that no government would ever
permit a business to function however
legitimate it may be that's a pun that's
funded and supported by a hostile power
freedom of press they said exists in
Israel but it's limited and is not
permitted to to undermine the security
of the state that's the High Court
well how much coverage was there are
those two things well everybody was
hysterical about laprincia answer zero
or to be precise there was a reference
in a letter to the Boston Globe in which
I was commenting on the total hypocrisy
of Harvard University and the Neiman
fellows I mentioned it but that as far
as I know is the total ref is the total
references in the United States the now
the week after the the central airing
Peace Accords went into operation
October 1987 la prensa was opened again
in a return to its task of calling for
the overthrow of the government and so
on identifying itself with the Contras
and so on the week that looked that la
prensa was reopened history again ran a
nice experiment for us that week the
State of Israel closed the newspaper in
Nazareth that's inside Israel and closed
the news office in noblesse the
newspaper in Nazareth was closed because
the state had again alleged without
providing any evidence that it was
associated with a hostile group and the
court went again went to the courts
the courts declare that this is
legitimate even though the editor had
stated which of course was true that
everything that appeared in the
newspaper had gone through censorship
because they have heavy censorship
didn't matter they nurse the office and
novelists I was closed on the same
pretext you know some connection with a
hospital group as far as I know it never
went to the courts so how much coverage
was there of those two things well the
usual answer zero I could go on but
these facts show very clearly they
answer very clearly the first question
the concern over freedom of the press in
Nicaragua is total fraud it does not
have anything to do with concern for
freedom of the press it simply has to do
with concern for serving the state in
fact the number of people in the United
States who believe in freedom of the
press and who I don't mean ordinary of
the people who write about such topics
or speak about them the number who
believe in freedom of the press I think
they could easily fit in somebody's
living room or maybe in the telephone
booth in fact and they would include
virtually nobody who's gotten hysterical
on this topic or even mentioned it all
right well that's the kind of thing
you'll discover if you look closely I'll
just give you one final example when I
talk about this topic I like to use this
morning's New York Times and you can
always find a perfectly good example
there on the front page but today
unfortunately I didn't have to I got up
at 5 o'clock in the morning in Eau
Claire and a snowstorm and had to drive
here and have time to find The Times
so I'll have to use yesterday's I
apologize last one I've looked at the
lead story in The New York Times
yesterday you know major story and left
right hand side of the front page
there's a story entitled US envoy urges
Hondurans to let the Contras stay and
then comes as the Bush administration's
trying and it's Honduras to let the
Contras stay there and it goes on and
get down to the middle of the second
page you know the continuation page and
you find the following sentence on its
face the administration proposal to keep
the Contras in place would seem to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
regional peace agreement which calls for
their relocation but administration
officials say there's no
consistency okay now as a forthright
critique of the government well let's
look at the facts that lie behind it
it's not that the proposal seems to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
regional peace agreement it's that it's
flatly inconsistent with the wording of
the regional peace agreement and it
doesn't matter which regional peace
agreement you're referring to if you're
referring to the Central American Peace
Accords of August 1987 they identify one
indispensable element they call it for
bringing peace to the region and that's
the termination of any aid logistical
technical propagandistic any aid
whatsoever to irregular forces or of
meaning the Contras attacking from
another country there was a more recent
agreement just a couple of weeks ago in
which the president the Central American
presidents committed themselves all five
of them to remove the Contras within to
work out plans for removing the
countries within 90 days so this is not
does not seem to be inconsistent with
the spirit of the agreement it's flatly
inconsistent with their precise wording
it goes on the point goes on there's
going to be a vote in Congress about
humanitarian aid to the Contras who were
convincing Nicaragua to leave and the
Honduras to leave in Nicaragua and the
press is going to refer to this as
humanitarian aid as they've been doing
all along well the term humanitarian aid
has a meaning in fact the meaning was
made very precise by the world court the
highest authority on such issues in the
very same judgment in which it condemned
the United States for its aggression in
Nicaragua they define humanitarian aid
as aid which meet to assess qualify as
humanitarian aid aid must meet the
hallowed purposes of the Red Cross that
is must serve civilians in need and
suffering and furthermore to qualify as
humanitarian aid aid must be given to
civilians on both sides of a conflict
without discrimination otherwise just
doesn't qualify as humanitarian aid so
by the ruling of the world court in fact
that's the standard definition what the
Media called humanitarian aid isn't
humanitarian aid at all it's just
military aid to keep a military force in
present in a so that they can continue
to pose a threat to Nicaragua I should
add incidentally that it's very likely
that the United States is sending
military aid to Contras inside Nicaragua
illegally from the illa Pongo airbase in
San Salvador exactly as that we'd been
doing all along that was that's what's
called the hassan lewis route because it
was exposed when the american mercenary
Eugene hasenfus was shot down now that
had been going on for years and the
median knew about it for years and they
weren't reporting the scandal came when
they were forced to report what they had
always known and then some of them were
honest of them admitted yeah we knew it
all along we weren't reporting in fact
they were being informed all along by
Nicaraguan intelligence that these
flights were coming they were told how
many there were where they were you know
they got radar sightings it just wasn't
the kind of story you report if you're a
good commissar so none of it was
reported until the plane was shot down
with the American mercenary and then you
know can't stop recording it well the
same Nicaraguan sources that were
ignored before and were accurate as
everyone concedes
are once again reporting that Nicaraguan
radar starting to pick up contra flights
from vilapando air force base into
Nicaragua and there's no particular
reason to doubt that those reports are
accurate now but I don't think there's a
single reference to these reports in the
media at least I've been able to find
one and it's not cost they don't know it
they came across the AP wire which means
everybody knows it and it's not that
it's an obscure fact after all that's
what whole iran-contra hearings were
about it's just that a disciplined press
doesn't report things like that now this
is a free country so you can find out
about it all the readers of barakatuh
Internacional the Sandinista newspaper
that's put out and you know that's
distributed from San Francisco so that's
about 1,500 people and so on they could
find out so fortunately you know nice
not to be in a totalitarian country but
the readers of the news or our people
happen have access to the AP wires and
read them all day you know they could
find out but people who are looking at
the
- or reading their newspaper I'm not
gonna find out though it's pretty
important well continuing with
humanitarian aid there's going to be a
vote on it in a couple of weeks and
probably they'll vote it the so-called
humanitarian aid that's been given is in
violation of the Central American
agreements it's actually even in
violation of the very Congressional
legislation that legislated the 8:00 in
other words it's an internal
self-contradiction which nobody will
point out in the media how's that work
it works as follows the Congressional
legislation last year to give
humanitarian aid stipulated that that
aid must be in accord with the Central
American agreements and with the
ceasefire agreement that had been just
settled between the Contras and the
government of Nicaragua
that's the legislation well that's this
fire agreement
I was quite explicit about the point it
says aid may be given to Contras in
designated ceasefire zones inside
Nicaragua for the purpose of relocating
them and reintegrating them into
Nicaraguan society now that's what the
so that means the Congressional edge the
according to congressional legislation
that's the only age we can give
furthermore it says that the aid has to
be given by a neutral Carrick carrier
well Congress immediately voted to
violate its own legislation that it had
just passed by designating US aid as the
carrier by no stretch of the imagination
is that neutral in fact it's not the bar
they're talking about that that's a
State Department affiliate which is
often functioned as a front for the CIA
furthermore the aid was to go to Contras
in Honduras not ceasefire zones inside
Nicaragua and to maintain them not to
assist in their relocation and
reintegration in the Nicaraguan society
so Congress at once voted to violate its
own legislation furthermore the same
ceasefire agreements designated a
responsible authority to determine how
the agreements should be met the
authority was the Secretary General of
the Organization of American States
Secretary General Suarez the American of
the organization the American States
as soon as this happened he wrote a
letter to George Shultz condemning the
United States for carrying out this
violation of the ceasefire agreement
which in fact even violated the the
Congressional legislation none of this
has ever been reported as far as I know
try to find it somewhere so even the
fact that that the responsible Authority
at once said the aid is illegal even the
fact that the Congressional aid is that
is violating even its own alleged
stipulations let alone the ceasefire
agreement than the regional peace accord
none of this is reported and I make a
prediction when the issue comes up in a
couple of weeks about renewing it you're
not going to find any of this reported
again well that's the kind of thing you
find when you look and you find it all
over the place in fact I think you find
that near universally I mean it'd be
hard to find an exception to it it's to
be expected that's the way you'd expect
the media to function on pretty
plausible assumptions let me return
finally to the prediction of the
propaganda model that I mentioned
however well confirmed it maybe it's not
going to be part of the discussion it's
going to be outside the spectrum of
discussion be it's very validity
guarantees that for the reasons that I
mentioned and that conclusion again is
quite well confirmed and one consumed
with reasonable confidence that that
will continue to be the case
you've been watching part one of a
presentation by Noam Chomsky a PDX
justice Media Productions from the
archived lecture manufacturing consent

and now we return to the question and
answer session from Noam Chomsky's March
15th 1989 presentation manufacturing
consent the political economy of the
mass media i is there somebody standing
at the mic why don't we let's just make
it mechanicals start over there then go
over there and then go up there okay and
then we'll go around okay I can't see ya
however a number of statements which you
have made in the past are a great
concern to me first and foremost among
them is your claim that the Soviet Union
is in fact dungeon and to my way of
thinking such a blanket condemnation of
an entire society can only be regarded
to say the least is inappropriate
moreover I believe that these kinds of
statements can become quite destructive
in serving to propagate inadequate and
outdated notions of the Communist enemy
and I I just wonder if your if these
ideas I've been waiting three years to
respond to that statement of yours and I
wanted to in the light of
the the changes that have that have come
about with Glasson austin peay destroyed
openness and restructuring argue it's
arguable what how significant they are
but if you I don't know if you still
maintain that strict view on the subject
yeah well first of all I didn't say that
the society is I said the the state is
the government and the you know maybe
people living in their homes or not but
I said it because I think it's true I
mean I think that the Soviet Union is a
dungeon I don't also don't think there's
anything to do with communists or
anything to do with socialism as to the
changes I think you know there one hopes
that they'll work what's happened is
that the jailers have decided to relax
it a little bit notice that those
changes are coming from the top which is
good you know better than having no
changes but in fact Gorbachev has
concentrated more power into his hands
than the leadership had in the past and
he's using that power in something like
the manor of Peter the Great to try to
liberalize the society from above which
means to cut back the restrictions to
open it up a bit and I think that's all
to the good
I mean I have a feeling that those
changes will set they've already set
forth lots of you know they have when
when you introduce changes like that
lots of things begin to happen popular
forces do begin to develop and you get
all kind of conflicts and interesting
things happen and it remains to be seen
where it'll lead so I'm glad to see that
the what I as I see it if you want to
continue with the metaphor that the
jailers have decided to open the cells a
little bit and to allow a little more
freedom in the society I think that's
very good and I hope that other forces
get them to continue to do it but as to
I mean we could just discuss whether
this is an accurate perception of the
society or not I guess you think it
isn't I think it is and I'll explain why
if you like but to get to the point you
raised suppose it suppose I think that
it is I think I should say it I don't
see any reason not to say it if I think
it's true I guess my only real question
is there's political repression in the
United States to deter United States
no because the United States a much
freer specifically I have what I've said
about the United States and I'll say it
again it's in many ways a freer society
in the world sure there's repression
here but it's also by comparative
standards a very free society fact I
think that's one of the reasons it has
such a sophisticated thought control as
I tried to explain the capacity of the
the capacity of the state to coerce in
the United States is relatively limited
you're quite right that there's plenty
of oppression I mentioned the FBI which
is the national political police which
is dedicated to oppression that's its
job it's been doing it ever since it was
founded well you know that's
inconsistent with the free society but
again by comparative standards remember
I'm talking about comparative standards
the United States is quite a free
society the capacity of the state to
coerce I think is limited probably more
so than any other Society I know at
least so I don't think that it would be
correct to call it a dungeon
