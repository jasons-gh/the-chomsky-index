you know the people in the public
relations industry aren't there for the
fun of it they're doing work they're
trying to instill the right values in
fact they have a conception of what a
democracy ought to be it ought to be a
system in which the specialized class
are trained in order to do their work
for the service of the Masters and the
rest of the population ought to be
deprived of any form of organization
because organization just causes trouble
they ought to be sitting alone in front
of the television set and having drilled
into their heads de la the message which
says the only value in life is to have
more commodities or to live like that
rich middle-class family are watching
and to be have nice values like harmony
and Americanism and that's all there is
in life you may think in your own hid
that there's got to be something more in
life than this but since you're watching
the tube alone you assume I must be
crazy because that's all that's going on
over there and since there is no
organization permitted that's absolutely
crucial you never have a way of finding
out whether you're crazy and and you
just assume it because it's the natural
thing to assume so that's that's the
ideal and great efforts are made into
trying to achieve that ideal and there
is a certain conception of democracy
behind it the conception of democracy is
the one that I mentioned but bewildered
heard are a problem we've got to prevent
their rage and trampling we've got to
distract them they should be watching
the Super Bowl or sitcoms or you know
violent movies or something every once
in a while you call on them to chant
meaningless slogans like support our
troops and you scare they got to keep
them pretty scared because unless
they're scared properly and frightened
of all kind of devils that are going to
destroy them from outside you know or
inside or somewhere they may start to
think which is very dangerous because
they're not competent to think and
therefore it's important to distract
them and marginalize well that's the
conception of democracy and in fact
going back to the business community the
last legal victory for labor really was
1935 the Wagner Act
after the war came the decline of unions
and in fact of a very rich working class
culture that was associated with the
unions that was destroyed and we did
move to live to a business run society
at a remarkable level this is the only
capitalist state capitalist society
industrial society which doesn't have
even the normal social contract that you
find in comparable societies so outside
of South Africa I guess this is the only
industrial society that doesn't even
have national health care that where
there's no general commitment even
minimal standards of survival for the
parts of the population that can't
follow those rules and gain things for
themselves individually unions are
virtually non-existent other forms of
popular structure or virtually
non-existent there's no political
parties no political organizations it's
a long way towards not totally but a
long way towards towards the ideal at
least structurally the media or
corporate monopolies basically have the
same point of view the two parties or
two factions of the business party most
of the population doesn't even bother
voting because it looks meaningless and
they're just the you know they're
marginalized and properly distracted at
least that's the goal the the leading
figure in the public relations industry
Edward Bernays actually came out of the
Creole Commission he was part of it
learned his lessons there went on to
develop the way what he described as
engineering of consent which he
described as the essence of democracy
and of course the people who are able to
engineer consent or the ones have there
who have the resources and the power to
do it the business community and that's
who you work for well it is also
necessary to whip up the population in
support of foreign adventures usually
the population is pacifistic just like
they were during the First World War
sees no reason to get involved in
foreign adventures and killing and
torture
and all that sort of thing so you have
to whip them up and to whip them up you
have to frighten them Bernays himself
had a important achievement than this
respect he he was the person who ran the
public relations campaign for the United
Fruit Company in 1954 when the u.s.
moved in to overthrow the capitalist
democratic government of Guatemala and
installed a murderous death squad
society which remains that way to the
present day with constant infusions of
US aid to prevent the Democratic
deviation that had taken place there
with regard to domestic programs it's
necessary to rant constantly ram through
domestic programs to which the public is
opposed because no reason for the public
to be in favor of domestic programs
which are harmful to most of the public
and that too takes extensive propaganda
we've seen a lot of it in the last 10
years the public for the Reagan programs
were overwhelmingly unpopular even the
people who voted for Reagan by about
three to two hoped that his policies
would not be enacted the if you take
particular programs like you know
armaments or cutting back on social
spending and so on every one of them was
almost every one of them was
overwhelmingly opposed by the public but
as long as the public is marginalized
and distracted and has no way to
articulate the organizer through
articulated sentiments or even to know
that you have these sentiments I mean
the people who said I'd prefer social
spending the military spending people
that Pope gave that answer on poles as
people overwhelmingly did assume that
they were the only people with that
crazy idea in their heads but they never
heard it from anywhere else no nobody's
supposed to think that and therefore if
you do think it and you answer it in a
poll you must assume well I'm sort of
weird that's what I think and since
there's no way to get together with
other people who share that view or who
will reinforce that view and help you
articulate it yourself you don't even
you know it's just you feel like an
oddity you feel like a kind of an
oddball so you just stay on the side you
know you know any attention to what's
going on you look at something else like
the Super Bowl the
uh to a certain extent then that ideal
was achieved but never really completely
there are institutions which it has as
yet been impossible to destroy the
churches for example still exist and
virtually you know a large part of the
dissonant activity in the United States
comes out of the churches for the simple
reason that they're there so you know
you go to some European country and give
a political talk may very likely be in
the union hall here that won't happen
because unions barely exist and if they
do exist they're not political
organizations but the churches do exist
and therefore you often give a talk in a
church Central America solidarity work
mostly grew out of the churches mainly
because they exist well the bewildered
heard never gets properly tamed that's
one so this is a constant battle in the
1930s as I say they kind of a rose again
and they sort of put down in the 1960s
there was another wave of dissidents
there was a name for that it was called
by the specialized class it was called
the crisis of democracy the crisis of
democracy was regarded as entering into
a crisis in the 1960s the crisis was
that large segments of the population
were becoming organized and active and
trying to participate in the political
arena now here we come back to these two
conceptions of democracy by the
dictionary definition that's an advance
in democracy but by the prevailing
conception that's a problem that has to
be overcome that's a crisis that has to
be overcome the population has to be
driven back to the apathy and obedience
and passivity that is their proper state
and we therefore have to do something to
overcome the crisis and great efforts
were made to achieve that hasn't worked
I mean the crisis of democracy is still
alive and well fortunately but not very
effective and changing policy but
certainly effective in changing opinion
contrary to what a lot of people believe
but great efforts were made after the
60s to try to reverse and overcome this
malady one aspect of the malady actually
got a technical name it was called the
Vietnam
in room the Vietnam syndrome the term
that sort of began to come up around
nineteen seventy it's actually been
defined occasionally the Reaganite
intellectual norman podhoretz defined it
as the sickly inhibitions against the
use of military force and there were
these sickly inhibitions against
violence on the part of the large part
of the public but you know just know
people didn't understand why does she go
around torturing people and killing
people and carpet bombing them and so on
and it's very dangerous for a population
to be overcome by these sickly
inhibitions as gurbles understood
because then there's a limit on foreign
adventures it's necessary as the
Washington Post put it the other day
rather proudly to instill in people
respect for the Marshall virtues that's
important if you want to have a violent
society that uses force around the world
to achieve the ends of its own domestic
elites it's necessary to have a proper
appreciation of the Marshall virtues and
none of these sickly inhibitions about
using violence so that's the Vietnam
syndrome and it's necessary to overcome
that one
