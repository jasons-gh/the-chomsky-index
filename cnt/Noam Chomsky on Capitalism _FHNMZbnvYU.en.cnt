your view what's wrong with private
ownership of the means of production we
should not have relations of hierarchy
dominance and subordination in
centralized control over the means of
life people who give orders and others
to take lives all that yeah I mean if
you have private ownership of the means
of production it means that first of all
the people it's not just one person it's
a institution so you get like maybe it's
a corporation or private business or
something
first of all internally it's essentially
a totalitarian institution almost
necessarily there's a group at the top
maybe a person or a group they make the
decisions they give orders people down
hierarchy get the orders transmit them
at the very bottom you get people who
are permitted to rent themselves to
survive that's called a job wage labor
and you get the outside community who's
allowed to purchase what you produce and
of course they're very heavily
propagandize to make them want to
consume it even if they don't so that's
the nature of the system it's kind of
about as close to totalitarianism as you
can imagine private enterprise works
just the way Milton Friedman says you
give the worst possible service at the
highest possible profit that's what it
means to be in the business if you try
to be benevolent you're out of the
business because somebody undercuts you
so the nature of the system is good
insight goes way back to Adam Smith is
to be as mean and rotten as you can to
try to maximize profit and market share
and give the worst possible service same
with HMOs and everything else the system
is is has unacceptable risk built into
it it's well-known among economists that
markets are inefficient from the
narrowest perspective so to make it
simple suppose you and I you suppose you
sell me a car okay we may make a good
deal for ourselves we're not taking
to account the effect on him that's
what's called an externality and there's
an effect if you sell me in a car a car
it increases gas prices increases
pollution increases congestion and that
extends very broadly these so-called
externalities can be very large now in
financial institutions it's far worse
they're in the business of taking risks
if they're well managed they they
calculate the potential cost to
themselves if there's a loss but the
important words are to themselves they
don't calculate in what's called
systemic risk the effect on the whole
system if I make if I go bust you know
and as a huge effect the result is that
risk-taking is underpriced meaning
there's a lot more of it than there
would be in a reasonable system but in
your role as CEO of a corporation you
are compelled to maximize profit and to
ignore what economists call
externalities that is the impact of your
transactions on others well that's why
we have repeated financial crises ever
since Reagan and Thatcher the
deregulation of the financial
institutions means that the people who
run them have to ignore what's called
systemic risk the risk that a
transaction is going to bring down the
system
and since you ignore it you're
increasing the probability of it and
therefore repeatedly happens so we
repeatedly have financial crises each
one worse than the last markets are
supposed to be magnificent because they
increase your choices actually they
restrict your choices you think about it
for a minute
suppose I want to get home from work at
night ok the market offers me a choice I
can have a four-door Toyota it does not
offer me the choice of a subway what I
want what's good for me what's good for
the environment what's good for my
children but that's not offered in the
market
markets offer individual consumption and
the enormous stress on the importance of
markets is part of the way to drive
people towards looking for yourself I'm
a Singh as many commodities you can
forget everything else in fact if you
think about it for every one of you in
an economics course or read about it
then you know what markets are supposed
to be markets are supposed to be systems
in which informed consumers make
rational choices right I'm sure every
one of you is turned on a television set
what do you see when you turn on a
television set you see that there's a
huge industry public relations industry
which began in the United States and
Britain incidentally huge industry which
is designed to undermine markets every
ad is an attempt to create an uninformed
consumer will make an irrational choice
right a huge effort on the part of the
business world the undermined markets
but to keep the aspect that's useful for
profit and power namely separating
people from one another it focusing on
individual choices not working with your
neighbor by now about close to half the
stock is owned by about 1% of the
population and the bottom 80% of the
population hold about 4% of the stock
and it's it's always understand the
corporations are interlinked like a bank
alone a big piece of one corporation and
it's a it's a massive system of highly
concentrated power given the rights of
immortal persons but without the
responsibility of person these are
amoral institutions in fact there are
private tyrannies which are amoral and
required to be amoral they move towards
out so they want to avoid monopolies
because then they get public service
requirements but they want to be very
limited so just a few of them
which can have what are called strategic
alliances they can effectively act
together
