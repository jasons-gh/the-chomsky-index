I don't mind the denunciations frankly I
mind allies well I mean intellect was a
very good in line but they're
professionals at it in a wonderful
technique there's no way of responding
those if somebody calls you of you know
an anti-semite what can you say I'm not
an anti-semite together somebody says
you're you're a racist you're as Nazis
I'm saying this you always lose I mean
the person throws mud always wins
because there's no way of responding
such charges professor Chomsky seems to
believe that the people he criticizes
fall into one of two classes liars of
dupes consider what happens when I
discuss the case of Oh bear fully soul
let me recall the facts let's not go
into details please because do we also
happen to be important yes what I have
only one question for you so Chris you
do the facts matter or don't be matter
its causes well let me tell you what the
facts are
sorry suspected but that the massacre of
the Jews in the Holocaust is a historic
lie now this is an implicit important
one has a lot to do with the topic your
views are extremely controversial and
perhaps one of the one of the things
that has been most controversial and
most strongly criticized for was your
defense of a French intellectual who is
suspended from this university post for
contending that they were no Nazi death
camps in World War two
my name is Robert Royston I am 60
I am university professor in Rio from
behind me you may see the cutout of
Paris the Senate existed in this place I
was convicted many times at the
beginning of the 18th I was charged by
nine education mostly Jewish Association
for inciting hatred racial reason for
racial definition for damage by
falsifying a story professor Chomsky and
the number of other intellectual signed
the petition in which for a song is
called a respected professor of
literature who merely tried to make his
findings public perhaps we can start
with just the story of Robert Forrestal
and your involvement more than 500
people sign maybe 600 mostly universite
we follow
and what happened to these other 499 of
them how come we only hear about Chomsky
signature well I think it's because
Chomsky is in himself is kind of
probably go to power
I timed the petition calling on the
tribunal for the bends of civil rights
I bent the French press which apparently
has no conception of freedom of speech
concluded that since I had called for
his civil rights I was ever depending
species so he sold then published a book
in which he tried to prove that the
nause gas chambers never existed what we
deny is that they are wrong an
extermination program and an
extermination actually especially in gas
chambers or get that the book contains
expresses written by professor Chomsky
in which he calls for his own a
relatively apolitical source of liberal
a communist is a man using man energy is
a man I am a man are you an axis I am
NOT energy how would you describe
yourself politically
nothing happens a year oh well you know
that's not the pressive preface that I
wrote because I never wrote a preface
and you know that I never wrote a press
he's referring to a statement of mine on
civil liberties which was added to a
book in which Horicon excuse me yes I
use the language you use as meaning
that's right but the language I use oh
come on you can be dignified by the word
finding of inclusion that is a judgment
and that is a favorable judgment always
use unconscious in with that yes you can
deal with the facts for hours but I mean
but they are perfect that yeah okay
let's get get Lee so called prefaced I
was then asked by the person who
organized the petition to write a
statement on freedom of speech that's
just the now kind of about freedom of
speech pointing out the difference
between the defending a person's right
to express his views and defending the
views expressed so I did that I wrote a
rather banal statement called some
elementary remarks on freedom of
expression and I told him do what you
like with it so I can't produce the book
which all the arguments of tourists on
were to be put in front of the court and
we thought wise to use the text of Noam
Chomsky as a kind of warning a foreword
to say that it was a matter of freedom
of expression freedom of thought freedom
of research why did you try at the last
moment to get it back from little the
one thing I'm sorry but the one real
that's the real implanting it's noise
you know joke I tried to reverse it in
with that you said it was wrong no I did
say if I take a look about it I wrote a
letter which we can publicize in which I
said look things have reached the point
where the French intellectual community
simply is incapable of understanding the
issues but at this point it's just going
to confuse matters even more if my
comments on freedom of speech happen to
be attached to this book which I don't
didn't know existed so just to clarify
things better separate them
not in retrospect I think after I should
have done that I should have just said
fine then let it appear because it ought
to appear but that's apart from that I
regard this is not only trivial but as
compared with other positions I've taken
on freedom of speech invisible I do not
think that the state ought to have the
right to determine historical truth and
to punish people he is I'm not willing
to give the state that right even if
they happen to go with nine gasps James
have written but I'm saying if you
believe in freedom speech you believe in
freedom speech the musi own life
I mean gurbles was in favor of freedom
speech for beauty like right so is
Stalin if you're in favor of freedom
speech that means you're in favor of
freedom speech precisely for views you
decide otherwise you're not in flavour
freedom speech two positions we can have
on freedom speech and you can decide
which position you want with regard to
my defense of the utterly offensive the
people who express utterly offensive
views I'm the slightest doubt that every
commissar says you're defending that
person's views no I'm not I'm defending
is right to express them
the difference is crucial and the
difference has been understood outside
of fascist circles since the 18th
century
is there anything like objectivity of
scientific objectivity reality lsanty
but I'm not saying I depend abused I
look if somebody publishes time to the
Garda core which I disagree with I do
not say the state or put in jail all
right but you don't have to support him
I do I didn't play your life's no no
this makes your buddy or gang they
thought that suppose suppose this guy is
taken to court and charged with
falsification then I'm going to defend
the revised buddy that's what happened
to Carl you're wrong but when did you
write possibly when he was in fact the
only support that I gave him is to say
he has a right of freedom of speech
period that is no doubt in my mind that
something that they gave about the sort
Oh locality not exist it's very very
typical imagine other examples how much
of the American press believe the glory
not has anything to say or any press how
much of the press in France since I saw
what percentage would you say I'll tell
you it higher than zero I said it higher
and higher I said have you ever seen
anything in any news or any journal
aside saying that this man has anything
of it apparently I'll try to understand
I tried to answer I think that I just
followed that very simple quest I
followed the case five or six years ago
and I happened to see that the North
Shore ski was in for strong criticism
even from some of his supporters for
doing something which could be
interpreted only in terms of a campaign
against Israel going back years I am
absolutely certain that I've taken far
more extreme positions on people who
deny the Holocaust than you have for
example you go back to my earliest
articles and you will find that I say
that even to enter into the arena of
debate on the question of whether the
Nazis carry out such atrocities is
already to lose one's humanity by
anything go discuss the issue if you
want to know my opinion but if anybody
wants to refute for a sauna there's
certainly no difficulty in doing
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
I'm I'm not interested in a freedom of
speech and all that I have to win and
that request and I shall win
[Music]
you
