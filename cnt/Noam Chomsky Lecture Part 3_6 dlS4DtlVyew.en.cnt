back around the same time urge that
people should be directed through what
it called the more superficial things of
life like fashionable consumption that
will keep them away from trying to
participate in decision-making through
the political process let alone in their
working lives as 19th century workers
demanded by now marketing is about
one-sixth of the economy and much of
marketing is just pure propaganda same
things happening to elections
increasingly especially in the last 30
years their PR extravaganzas that's
particularly since the 1970s when a
major changes took place in the economy
I'll come back to that we're now in a
situation where both markets and
democracy are being very effectively
undermined by the business classes and
others who praise them to the skies if
you've ever taken an economics course
you've learned that markets are based on
rational uninformed consumers making
rational choices and you're supposed to
repeat that when you take an exam if
you've ever looked at television and
looked at an ad you know that business
is pouring huge efforts into creating
uninformed consumers who will make
irrational choices they want to
undermine markets in their own interest
so for example if we had a market system
and say General Motors was advertising a
car they put up a small ad saying here
are the characteristics of the cars that
we're going to sell next year or try to
sell well you know they don't do that
what they do is have a famous football
player Hollywood actress or somebody
car performing some miraculous thing you
know and the effort is to try to delude
you to try to create uninformed
consumers who will make irrational
choices thus undermining markets and
democracies undermine the same way not
surprisingly it's the same people PR
agencies who put up the ads are also
running the elections so in elections
you don't provide information about the
candidates it's the last thing you want
to do what you do is try to dilute
people with rhetorical devices with
slogans and so on and so forth but keep
the issues out of sight good reasons for
that come back to it well this has been
going on since the nineteen it goes on
way back but there was an upsurge in the
1970s you all know what happened in the
60s in the and there was a huge
corporate backlash against the popular
uprisings of the 60s which we're really
civilizing the society and making it
more democratic and free that's
unacceptable there was also a lot of
legislation in the public interest and
against the interests of business like
the Environmental Protection Agency OSHA
defending safety standards health and
safety standards for working people the
Earned Income Tax Credit probably the
most important liberal measure since the
New Deal there was the Consumer Product
Safety Commission there's very sharp
expansion of Social Security and other
social measures all of this incidentally
was under Nixon Nixon was the last
liberal president after that it's all
back to the Stone Age and business was
appalled by this the right at that time
there was a vast increase in lobbyists
to shape and control legislation
actually to write it to serve corporate
interests
there was the beginnings of the major
attack on regulation which is an
interference with corporate prerogatives
and also protects the economy and people
but doesn't matter all of this was
expanded substantially under Reagan and
even more so under successors Clinton
and Bush most of it under Clinton in
fact the new think tanks were
established like the heritage foundation
to try to take over the ideological
spectrum the cost of campaigns
skyrocketed at that time that compelled
the parties to become supportive of
business for the Republicans it's going
to second nature the Democrats had a
somewhat different constituency not much
but they were compelled to go along to
survive and they did so you get this
sharp right word move of both parties
that Clinton wasn't joking when he said
that now we're all Eisenhower
Republicans that's correct the Democrats
are now what used to be called moderate
Republicans like Eisenhower and the
Republicans are so deep in the pockets
of business you need a telescope to find
them well that's a campaign spending
incidentally is a very good predictor of
electoral victory and more significant
than that and less obvious is that
they're very it's a very good predictor
of the policies that are pursued there's
really outstanding work on this by a
number of political scientists primarily
Thomas Ferguson who's the main person
who studied it his book Golden Rule and
others well to understand to put put
that into place what was going on in the
70s and since it's useful to take a
quick look at the post-world war two
period at the 50s and the 60s which were
still under the influence of the New
Deal and a powerful labor movement they
were the greatest growth period in
American
mystery and furthermore it was
egalitarian growth so the lowest
quintile lowest twenty percent did about
as well as the upper Quint upper
quintile you know of course they got
more but I'm proportionately this is
often called by economists the Golden
Age of American capitalism more
accurately American state capitalism in
the 1970s there were major changes the
one was a fundamental shift of the
economy away from production towards
financialization the role of financial
institutions they have a role you know
to direct unused assets to productive
uses and it's more or less what they
were doing in the 50s and 60s now almost
none of that they're probably harmful to
the economy but they also grew
enormously there were a few percentage
of corporate profits back in the 60s
it's now maybe a third probably hit
forty percent at the peak right before
the recession the along with this was
the hollowing out of production it's
instantly not that production stops it's
just shipped abroad that has a lot of
advantages it sets working people in
competition with one another all over
the world and that has the obvious
effect of lowering wages and benefits
that's fine for corporate profits and
for banks and investment firms it's
terrible for the workforce and the
middle class but now we're back to the
guiding principle as long as they are
quiet and passive everything's fine
meanwhile state corporate policy
government policy specifically has been
increasingly geared to welfare for
extreme wealth and privilege the extent
of this is pretty shocking when you look
at the details and we all know that
there should know that
inequality has maybe reach the highest
level in American history but that's
misleading because the any the sharp
rise in inequality has to do with the
extreme top of the income spectrum the
top 1% even the top one tenth of one
percent that's where there's been a
spectacular increase in wealth that's
predominantly corporate executives hedge
fund managers and so on tax cuts have
been very carefully crafted to benefit
the super-rich particularly this tiny
slice of super-rich that's very careful
so very carefully done so it takes a the
bush tax cuts it's now a huge burden on
the economy big part of the deficit but
remember they were established in 2001
they were supposed to last for ten years
the assumption is once you establish a
tax that's never going to be tax cuts
never going to be raised because it'll
be politically difficult when they were
crafted in such a way that people
wouldn't see what was happening so for
the first couple of years it wasn't
egalitarian but it wasn't hugely in
favor of the super rich so people had a
sense okay we're all getting a tax cut
fact one of the first things that
happened was it was carefully designed
everybody got a small tax rebate so you
felt good before having a tax cut
meanwhile if you look over the ten-year
period what was designed was that as you
go through it it will be geared more and
more to the super rich and by the end of
it 2010 literally over fifty percent of
the tax cut was going to the top 1% but
that's not so visible so and it was
hidden and all kind of other ways you
know stock options and so on but that's
very careful design very clever even has
a name it's called the sunset technique
you pretend that you're giving a tax cut
to everyone but by the time the sunset
is going to the right people you know
the top 1% the actually that's happening
right now before our eyes the lame-duck
Congress is greatly praised you know
bama's praised for his wonderful
achievements and the lame-duck Congress
there was one major achievement namely a
tax break for the wealthy the which of
course greatly increases the deficit and
a rather remarkable PR operation was
carried out fact pretty impressive the
tax cut for the wealthy was opposed by
about two-thirds of the population the
deficit we're told every day mostly
falsely is a huge problem but here we
are with the Republicans straight out
but Obama going along increasing the
deficit carrying out a tax cut for the
rich which was the issue over the
objections of the great majority of the
population well kind of an experiment
see if people keep quiet even when this
is happening before their eyes actually
was more than that right at the same
time with everybody screaming about how
awful taxes are there was a tax increase
substantial tax increase for federal
workers it was disguised it was called a
freeze but if you think for a minute a
freeze for people in the public sector
is identical to a tax increase for
people in the public sector the state of
the union address Obama's apparently
going to announce a five-year freeze
well that means a five-year
increase for federal workers and also a
reduction freeze remember is a reduction
because of inflation population growth
and so on so he's going to announce the
reduction in services for working people
in the middle class and the rich don't
care they don't use the services that's
going to be presented as a great
achievement addressing the deficit and
actually we should have a deficit during
a recession but that's a separate
question and I mentioned before what the
deficit is really due to half of it
military spending not for defense fact
that harm security and the other half
the totally dysfunctional health care
system but so all makes sense if you
have the right principles the the tax
increase so-called freeze for federal
workers relies on a very another very
effective PR campaign that's been going
on for a couple of months now namely
demonizing working people in the public
sector now that's been successful as
polls throw know people are beginning to
accept the message that are a financial
crisis is not due to huge bonuses and
Goldman Sachs but to the fact that
teachers and police and firefighters are
getting overpaid and have these
wonderful pensions and so on no total
lies but lying is so routine by now that
the it's not even worth mentioning it's
just the mode of the mode of discourse
the the same is going to be true of the
presumably of what is going to be
announced in the state of the union
there was also during the lame duck
session an interesting device introduced
a payroll tax decrease for Social
Security now that sounds good and people
feel good they're going to
money in the in the mail but just think
about it for a minute it's a Trojan
horse the social security tax tea
