this is my directions as to how to get
here I'll spare you then it may seem a
bit odd or even maybe perverse to use
the title deterring democracy for a
discussion of US policies at home and
abroad we are after all it's supposed to
be basking in Pride over having served
as an inspiration for the triumph of
democracy in our time quoting an
editorial in The New Republic given that
how can it be suggested that the United
States actually has a dedicated and
persistent commitment to undermine and
deter democracy throughout the world not
least at home actually there's no
conflict between those two propositions
they're both true it's true on the one
hand that we're an inspiration for the
triumph of democracy in our time and
it's also true that the US has been
dedicated to preventing and undermining
democracy in order to reconcile the
apparent conflict you just have to bear
in mind something important and common
knowledge about reading anything
concerning affairs that matter the terms
of political discourse including
democracy typically have two meanings on
the one hand there's the dictionary
meaning on the other hand there's what
we might call the PC meaning now using
the term in its accurate sense the
meaning the doctrinally correct meaning
good meeting that's used for purposes of
ideological warfare and those two
meanings are often diametrically opposed
so in the case of democracy there are
two meanings in the dictionary sense of
the word a society is democratic insofar
as
the general public has the possibility
of participating in some meaningful
fashion in management of public affairs
a lot of dimensions of that and insofar
as that true of the society is
democratic in the doctrinally correct
sense society is democratic insofar as
it's under the firm control of business
interests linked to us power and that
applies at home as well and the general
public is marginalized now separating
out those two meanings it's perfectly
possible to be an inspiration for the
triumph of democracy in the world and
the doctrinally correct sense and to be
opposed systematically to democracy at
home and abroad in the dictionary sense
of the word and in fact I think that's
exactly what we find there is a there
there's an ideological system which
describes us as the Democratic ourselves
leading democratic country fighting for
democracy everywhere there is also a
truth that we're opposing democracy at
home and abroad
both are true just in different senses
of democracy actually the term United
States also has two meanings and they
have to be separated on the one hand the
United States can stand for the people
who live in this geographical area on
the other hand that can refer to the
rulers the people who feel entitled to
and do in fact manage and control the
society and those are just two different
groups
and it's been that way ever since the
origins of the Republic it's been
founded on that basis it's well to
remember the guiding maxim of fact it
was the favorite favorite saying of John
Jay the president of the Constitutional
Convention that those who own the
country ought to government and that's
the way it was supposed to be and when
rebellious farmers around Massachusetts
didn't understand that they had it
driven into their heads by force and
that's the way the society was
established it's the way the legal
system was established and it's the way
it's been run ever since those who
the country are supposed to govern it
and if they do and the general public is
quiet and passive it's a democracy in
the doctrine we correct since the public
often gets out of hand and when the
public gets out of hand and tries to
enter the arena of public affairs
there's a name for that - it's called a
crisis of democracy which has to be
overcome
that was the title of if you want to
really understand the United States
probably the most one of the most
important books one could read in my
opinion is a book called the crisis of
democracy published in 1975 and when
people started reading it quickly pulled
out of circulation but then it sort of
sneaked back in it was published by the
Trilateral Commission that's their only
major publication it was a the
trilateral commission is a is sort of
the liberal side of the International
ruling class you know it's the people
around Jimmy Carter in fact he came out
of there Clinton - I think it's the sort
of you know the liberal wing of the
international elites business academic
and so on trilateral because it involves
Europe Japan in the United States in the
early 70s they were particularly
concerned over the crisis that had
arisen in the 1960s namely that large
sectors of the population who are
usually apathetic and marginal and you
know watching the Super Bowl or
something we're becoming involved in
public affairs we're trying to enter the
political arena to press their demands
and to become organized and so on now in
the dictionary sense of the word that's
democracy but in the PC sense that's a
crisis democracy which has to be
overcome and the you know the scholars
and others and American was a professor
from Harvard who wrote the statement
they describe how it's necessary to
overcome this crisis to restore the
public to apathy and passivity and as
the professor of government at Harvard
put it - go back to the days when Truman
was able to run the country with the aid
of a few Wall Street lawyers and
financiers that was
good old days before the crisis erupted
and we have to somehow go back to that
in fact there's been a major ideological
offensive for the past 20 years
to try to overcome this crisis and to
try to restore the proper state of
things now it all makes perfect sense we
can be an inspiration for democracy and
we can be concerned about the crisis of
democracy when the public starts getting
involved in public affairs all makes
sense as long as you just keep the
wording straight and remember that
everything's got a there's a new speak
version and there's an English version
then you just have to separate them out
gets a little tricky sometime but if you
think it through it works fine actually
the example that I quoted from the New
Republic illustrates this quite
dramatically that statement about the
inspiration you know for democracy in
our time came in a an article exalting
over the outcome of the February 1990
elections in Nicaragua which happened to
illustrate very clearly exactly how
democracy is understood by across the
spectrum of educated opinion in the
United States there's a liberal
conservative difference but it falls
together on important issues like this
one and it's worth having a look at it
closely because it does illustrate what
is meant by democracy and what you know
what the sense in which we try to
inspire we in this sense you know rulers
try to inspire and create democracy
actually was worth going back a couple
of months to November 1989 it was an
interesting date because that was the
date when the Berlin Wall fell and after
that time unless you're really pretty
crazed you couldn't believe that the
Russians are coming so any pretense that
the bad things we do are in reaction to
the Russian threat could no longer be
upheld I mean I could never be upheld
but certainly after February November
1989 I was hopeless everybody except
real fanatics
you know I had maybe there's some people
around they still think they're you know
kind of trying to mislead us and they're
really gonna come back at our throats
but people who are moderately saying
abandoned the idea that the Cold War was
not at that time so for it's very
interesting then to look at events since
November 1989 to see just how much has
changed if you look you see nothing's
changed which tells you exactly what the
Cold War was but that's a different
topic in any event on this topic on
democracy November 1989 was interesting
there were November 18 1989 there were
in fact elections in Honduras which had
been under US control at that point for
ten years and the elections were
described by George Bush as an inspiring
example of the Democratic promise that
today is spreading throughout the
Americas so we inspire the world in
Honduras kind of little country so they
only inspire the Americas and in fact
there was an election there were was
there were two candidates one of them
represented large landowners the other
represented big industrialists they had
the identical programs therefore there
was no there was a there was a campaign
but it was just insults and
entertainment it's kind of not unlike
one that appeared to the north a few
months earlier the the effective rulers
of the military and who are under US
control the during the period right up
to the election the there's a regular
low-level of human rights abuses
you know killings and so on and so forth
it's not like El Salvador Guatemala it's
just kind of low level and that
escalated a bit before the elections I
had union leaders killed and left by the
roadside and that sort of thing the
starvation and misery are rampant and
increasing they'd increased considerably
during the decade of democracy as its
called
along with capital flight and huge debt
and
and so on it's extraordinarily poor
country but profits are flowing there's
no real threat to order the level of
state terror is low enough so you don't
forget to exercised about it you know
some torture or some killing but not
massive so therefore it's an inspiring
example of democracy then we're all
happy about it we've brought democracy
to Honduras and we can be inspired
November 1989 the same month was the
opening of the electoral campaign in
Nicaragua
Nicaragua had in fact had elections in
1984 but those elections were not an
inspiring example of democracy the
reason is that they couldn't be
controlled and therefore they don't
qualify it's therefore been necessary to
write them out of history and in fact
they are out of history in the United
States oh you're not allowed to mention
them the press can't mention it was
necessary to suppress completely the
fact that the Latin American Studies
Association the professional association
of Latin American scholars had a detail
how to vary the closest this gut
analysis of an election on the spot that
they'd ever had and you know I thought
it was quite good and so on same was
true of the hostile observer had very
widely observed the Dutch government
sent a very hostile official delegation
which reluctantly conceded that the
elections were fine and the Irish
parliament had a right-wing delegation
which drew the same conclusion as the
British Parliament had the same and so
on all this had to be X can be mentioned
in the press ever could there never were
elections that's a dogma and PCE usage
there were no elections but they were
going to have them in 1990 this time the
US was taking no chances as the
electoral campaign opened in November
1989 Violeta Chamorro the u.s. candidate
was brought to Washington for photo
opportunities in the White House issued
a statement saying that the US embargo
which was strangling the country would
be maintained
less the u.s. candidate one so
Nicaraguans have told Vogler our person
or what your children's star next
Congress and the White House jointly
continued the support for the terrorist
forces that the US was running from
Honduras
they called it humanitarian aid that was
a lie that had already been determined
by the World Court which determined
officially and again that's something
you can't cite here that it was not
humanitarian aid it was military aid the
White House Congress decision to
continue it and to maintain the level of
terror was in violation of the decision
of Central American presidents the
decision of the world court the UN which
is irrelevant because the u.s. just
vetoed every resolution that came along
and that was the next step media
continued as they had in the past to
suppress all of this I mean you really
have to be an addict to figure it out
it's there you know if you look
carefully but nobody would know the
Nicaraguans were essentially informed
that only a vote for the u.s. candidate
could end the terror and in the economic
strangulation and in fact there which
was illegal both in fact condemned by
the world court that was the condition
for the election so the plane the
playing field was level as we put it and
there was an election and it was kind of
interesting to look at the reactions to
it north and south of the Rio Grande
actually written article data but south
of the Rio Grande through Latin America
it was described simply as a victory for
George Bush allot it by the right wing
incidentally the press is mostly
right-wing because any other press has
been murdered or destroyed and they
liked the outcome but it was simply
flatly described as a victory for George
Bush not as an election which is exactly
the way we would have described that if
something similar at they can play say
and Lithuania under
Russian and terrorist attack or
something in the United States on the
other hand it was uniformly described as
the way the New York Times put it in a
headline victory for us fair play in
fact the big us article the New York
Times article was called Americans
united in joy over the victory for us
fair play actually that phrase itself is
interesting there are countries where
you find things like you know United
enjoy like maybe Albania you know North
Korea you could imagine
Albanians United enjoy over something
about or other countries were
totalitarian cultures and forts so it
was Americans United enjoy over victory
for us fair play and it's not that
people were unaware of how the victory
was achieved
they were pretty frank about it in fact
so here's Time magazine Time magazine
described I'm quoting the means that
were employed to bring about what they
called the latest the the latest in the
happy series of democratic surprises as
democracy burst forth in Nicaragua and
the method was to wreck the economy and
prosecute a long and deadly proxy war
until the exhaustive natives overthrow
the unwanted government themselves at a
cost to us that is minimal leaving
victim leaving the victim with wreck
bridges sabotage power stations and
ruined farms and thus providing the u.s.
candidate with a winning issue ending
the impoverishment of the people of
Nicaragua okay that's the way we did it
so it's a victory for us fair play and
Americans are united enjoy well that
frankness is kind of refreshing I mean
you might find something similar in Nazi
Germany here maybe Stalinist Russia
possibly I'm not sure but it tells you
exactly what is meant by the Americans
United United in joy over the victory
for democracy that's what they mean by
democracy democracy is where you you
make it very clear by murderer and
or an economic strangulation that you
vote for us or else and then if it works
it's democracy okay there we have
democracy and the politically correct
sense and in that sense as you know I'm
not making it up you're I'm reading from
the mainstream in fact even the liberal
side of the mainstream you have an
explanation of what democracy amounts to
actually some similar stories going on
right now and it's going to be replayed
in what's today the 24th in a couple of
days in Angola you know it's it's a
repetition of the Nicaragua story but
even uglier there the number of people
who've been murdered is not thirty or
forty thousand but probably half a
million or so and the country has been
totally devastated from 1975 the country
has been under attack first by by South
Africa and by the us-run terrorist
forces who need attacking the country
first from Namibia as long as it was
possible to hang on to that and then
switched over to say year another us
kind of colony the United States is
almost alone in the world in refusing to
recognize the Angolan government since
1975 the South African forces continued
to attack until 1990 they were they for
the suffer defeat by the Cuban forces
that were there to defend the country
against South African aggression which
is considered a absolute atrocity in the
United States that there were Cubans
there trying to stop South African
aggression the after that South Africa
withdrew and there was an agreement a
p6o peace agreement in May 1991 which
called for elections that you're
supposed to come off a few days 29th and
30th of September exactly as in Central
America exactly as in Central America
after the peace agreements the u.s.
moved it once to subvert it it subvert
them it continued to offer support to
the unit forces who are who are vicious
terrorists I mean
not much doubt about that they take
credit for shooting down civilian
airliners torture or all sorts of things
the here's the way it's described by it
South good South African reporter
Phillips on Niekerk who sometimes writes
for the Boston Globe
you may have seen him he's one of the
best South he was a Nieman Fellow a
little while back he writing from Angola
writes that Savimbi the head of when it
has the has the edge in the election the
peasants don't like unit but most of the
people are afraid that if unit aa loses
the elections the war will go on people
are aware of the atrocities committed by
juanita and appalled at the prospects
that they might win the election but
continuation of the war is more than
they can bear with millions of dollars
of US aid unit eyes well-placed to run a
high-profile election campaign with
plenty of handouts for voters he says
that a new a new wave of white settlers
is now recolonizing Angola Afrikaners
mostly South Africans and later perhaps
Portuguese returning to reclaim their
lands it's an old Portuguese colony if
Savimbi wins victoria britain who
reports in southern africa for the
london guardian says that the only
optimism now comes from the south
african businessmen in the hotels in one
the the capital who say if unit wins
we'll have the country handed to us on a
plate and if the MPLA the government
wins they'll will still have the country
for a handful of ran South African coins
because it's so devastated there's
nothing else left so here's a country
total ruins hundreds of thousands of
killed under still under attack by
terrorist forces and when the election
comes if it comes out the right way
Americans will again be united in joy
over the inspiring victory of democracy
in fact we're already united in joy
Anthony Lewis who's absolutely outer
limits of dissent and you know in the US
media hadn't column a couple of weeks
ago and she was just gushing with praise
over what he called the consistent
American policy from the nineteen seven
to help negotiate an end to the brutal
civil war in Angola
that's the civil war that we kept
maintaining while blocking every effort
to stop it and the successful pursuit of
the Bush administration of a peaceful
policy aiming at a political solution in
Nicaragua which is what I just described
well that's the attitude toward
democracy it continues right with after
the Cold War's over continues with
absolutely no change
September here's another little later
September 1990 there was a Latin
American strategy development workshop
held in Washington and it academics and
others and it described relations with
Mexico which is a really vicious
dictatorship it described relations with
the Mexican dictatorship as as they put
it extraordinarily positive completely
untroubled by stolen elections by death
squads by what Amnesty International
calls an endemic torture scandalous
treatment of workers and peasants all
that stuff was fine but there's one
problem here it is a democracy opening
in Mexico could test the special
relationship by bringing into office a
government more interested in
challenging the United States on
economic and nationalist grounds so we
got to watch out everything is okay now
you know it's run by gangsters and
terrorists but there might be a
democracy opening in which case there
might be a challenge to the United
States on nationalist and economic
ground so that's problem and in fact
this is an internal conference people
aren't supposed to read it and but
anyone who's familiar with the internal
record of planning recognizes this right
off they are simply reiterating cliches
the standard position of US planners
with regard to the third world in
general is exactly what they say it's
the threat to US interests in the third
world is nationalism democracy anything
that might involve popular pressures
and it's explicit in planning documents
from way back particularly with regard
to Latin America because that's the one
we run most closely the threat to us
interest is identified as what are
called radical mesh reticle and
nationalist regimes which might be
responsive to pressures from the mass of
the population for improvement in low
living standards and diversification of
production for domestic needs and why is
that a threat because our interest is
preservation of a satisfactory climate
of investment with adequate repatriation
of profits and protection of our
resources and that's going to be
interfered with by economic nationalism
by radical and nationalist regimes by
regimes that are enough under popular
pret doesn't matter whether they're
right left anything else that's kind of
irrelevant but if they're under the
kinds of popular pressures which might
regard the local population as a
priority that's no good because the
priority is the local business classes
and Western investors so there's a
conflict we got a block if we can have
formal democracy like Honduras while the
groups who are attuned to US interests
and subject to US demands are in power
then it's democracy and it's inspiring
if it's anything else terror economic
strangulation and torture and so on well
that tells you precisely what the
attitude toward democracy is and it's
not just democracy so say George Kennan
who's one of the more well actually one
of the most influential post-war
planners but also one of the most humane
and had an important this when he was
head of the policy planning staff of the
State Department back in 1948 he's
really one of the main architects of the
post-war world he had an important study
Declassified now in which he just
discussed the whole third world describe
how we have to deal with each part of it
and the general line was as he put it
that we must put aside vague and
idealistic slogans like democratization
human rights and raising the living
standards and be prepared to use
straight power concepts and if we don't
do that we will not be able he's
to maintain the disparity between our
wealth and their poverty so let's put
aside any vague and idealistic slogans
about democratization raising the living
standards or human rights and that's
exactly what we've done
the US has consistently opposed to
democracy and the dictionary sentence in
the third world for the obvious reason
that if a country is Nemec Radek it's
going to be to the extent that it's
democratic it's going to reflect popular
interests but those are inconsistent
with what I regard as US interests
namely the interest in exploitation
investment raw materials and so on the
third world is supposed to be a service
area they're supposed to provide
resources raw materials cheap labor
markets nowadays opportunities for
export of pollution and if they get out
of control we've got to do something
about it
that's position is across the spectrum
of course there are rhetorical
flourishes but if you look at actual
policy and even the way in which policy
is formulated internally it's quite
consistent about this and under those
assumptions you can understand why a
victory for terror and economic
strangulation would be regarded as a
victory for fair play and Americans
would be united enjoy about it the right
kind of Americans that is the ones who
count we have followed canons advice not
only with regard to democracy anybody
who knows anything about the South can
take you do I'm sure it doesn't have to
be told about living standards which are
abysmal they make Eastern Europe look
like a paradise the with regard to human
rights there have been a number of
studies and they're an interesting
there's a relationship between US policy
and human rights close relationship and
fact namely you know just quote the
leading academic scholar on human rights
in Latin America Laura Shultz who's one
of the several people who study this in
detail
he said US aid tends to flow to the most
egregious violators of human rights in
the hemisphere to countries that torture
their citizens and in fact that's
worldwide
very close correlation between torture
and us a it's not that us planners like
torture
they don't care one way or another about
torture but they like something else
what they like is a favorable climate
for investment and it just happens that
the way to maintain a favorable climate
for investment is to murder priests and
kill union leaders and blow up the
independent press and so on and so forth
so you get a secondary correlation
between aid which goes to improving the
investment climate and human rights
violations that correlation incidentally
doesn't influence the cultural managers
so they continue to tell us about the
deep us dedication to human rights
because it's a matter of logic it's
independent of facts and logic can't be
computed confuted by mere fact as anyone
knows so it in fact
Kennan's advice has been been followed
quite correctly and in particular with
regard to democracy well that's the
third world maybe it's different
elsewhere
what about the industrial societies you
know Europe here the problem these are
stable societies there you know they run
without too much institutional change
but if you look back at the there's
dramatic period there's an important
period which in which the question of
democracy and the industrial societies
did arise namely right after the Second
World War
second world worthy and after the Second
World War the industrial world was
devastated outside the United States and
it had to be reconstructed and the US
was had a position of overwhelming power
just overwhelming power it was going to
redesign the industrial societies and it
had the power to do it
Japan Germany had both been defeated
they were then called the great
workshops you know the major industrial
societies same was true of Italy France
and so on had to be reconstructed and
how is it going to be done well if you
look at what happened in the late 40s
you see exactly how it was done it was
done with remarkable consistency they
were all over the world it was
from South Korea and Japan all the way
over to Italy and friends first thing
that had to be done was to destroy the
anti-fascist resistance which just had
too much credibility and it was popular
based the traditional conservative order
had been discredited
by its association with fascism but that
was the traditional business order and
that had to be reinstated in power so
all over the world what the you the
first first chapter of post-war history
was to undermine and destroy the
anti-fascist resistance and to restore
the traditional rulers and I was done
without exception no country after
country sometimes it had required bloody
violence so in Greece it required a
civil war in which about 160,000 people
were killed in South Korea about a
hundred thousand people were killed
before what we call the Korean War in
repression to try to restore the old
order in Western Europe you know I
didn't have to kill that many people who
was done in other ways but it was done
that meant destroying at least
undermining labor restoring fascist
collaborators in Japan the old fascist
system was basically reconstructed with
the democratic forces crushed unions
pretty much destroyed and so on same
happened in Germany Italy was a dramatic
case because it looked as if it was out
of control for a while
there was an election in Italy in 1948
and it was widely expected that the
Communists would win they were they had
the prestige of having led the anti-nazi
resistance and they were supported by
labour they were pretty independent and
it was widely assumed that they were
going to win there was a split among
u.s. planners at that time as to what to
do George Kennan this is thought we got
to invade not even let the election take
place others figured it's not necessary
we can buy it off and in fact they let
the election go but not but careful
Italy was starving the US could control
the food food supplies were it was made
extremely clear that if the Communists
won the place is going to starve
food supplies were held back the fascist
police was reinstated you
were attacked there was a whole range of
threats that were used and they worked
but there was a reserve plan the
National Security Council had just been
formed at that point CIA the whole
national security apparatus and the
first National Security Council
memorandum NSC one is the highest level
planning the first one as the 1948 is
devoted to Italy and it describes a
series of measures that will be should
month that will be taken if the election
comes out the wrong way which includes
support for terrorist forces within
Italy and national mobilization in the
United States and in fact direct
military intervention if nothing else
works
that's NSC one they weren't kidding
around but fortunately the threat of
starvation and strangulation worked and
there were other ideas planned they
thought that there are too many Italians
in Italy part of the problem is there's
just too much population there and
they're too disruptive so what you have
to do is thin out the population and a
secret plan was adopted actually this
was just just came made public rather
recently in the last two or three years
as part of the Marshall Plan to send
them somewhere else will where well they
didn't want them here we had plenty of
watts in the United States already as
they were referred to incidentally in
internal documents plenty of wops here
already we didn't want any more of them
Europe had a problem of over you know
too many people around they didn't what
to do with so it was decided to send
them off to Latin America and Congress
therefore allocated funds for ships to
send Italians or they decided on Brazil
they thought that'd be the best place
sent him off to Brazil Brazil was given
a to try to absorb them and the idea was
to try to thin out the disruptive
population so we didn't have this crisis
of democracy US intervention to subvert
Italian democracy continues at least
until the mid seventies
that's when the record runs dry nobody
knows if it went on after that but and
it was pretty serious it involved
support for neo-fascist organizations
preparation for military crews and so on
the subverting democracy is
not a small problem it's got a it's
taken very seriously once the
traditional conservative business order
was re-established in Europe and the
industrial societies then it could just
run but up until then there was a
problem what about at home last part of
the story in the United States well here
there is a theory about democracy - I
already mentioned a little bit of it
the theory is that those who own the
country ought a government and we have
to figure out ways to make that happen
that was of course the founding fathers
now it's there's a 20th century people
are more sophisticated so there's much
more elaborate theories and there are
worked out in some detail and they have
to there's a spectrum of opinion about
it over the most interesting is the kind
of liberal side that's people like the
trilateral commission with their crisis
of democracy if you look at what are
called progressive essays on democratic
theory by American academics and others
there's a strain that runs through them
it was sometimes but very clearly it was
perhaps most clearly by walter Lippmann
in his work called progressive essays on
democrata mccr attic theory back in the
1920s he was you know major intellectual
figure and the Dean of American
journalism and so on and his essays back
in the 20s when he wrote about this
stuff are quite interesting he explained
that in a democracy there are two
classes of people there are the people
that he called the responsible men
sometimes they're called the political
class or some other name small segment
of the population and those are the ones
who have to rule and then there's the
the rest who he said are the wildered
heard and we have we the responsible men
have to protect ourselves from the
trampling and the rage of the bewildered
herd now it's a democracy not a fascist
state
so the bewildered herd has a function he
said they have a function their function
is to be spectators not participants and
as spectators since again it's a
democracy they're allowed something else
is it periodically the
may lend their weight to one or another
member of the responsible men
that's called an election so
periodically something comes along and a
couple of different members of the
ruling group of responsible men come
forward and say you know you can choose
among us and then the spectators are
allowed to choose and then they're
supposed to go back and be spectators
again that's democracy the you go to the
academic side you know people like say
Harold Lasswell is founder of modern
political communication theory and all
that stuff and his wrote he wrote about
this again in the 1930s he said we must
not succumb to democratic dogmatism
about men being the best judges of their
own interests they're not said we're the
best judges of their interests we can't
control them by force because we don't
have that kind of state so we have to
control their thinking we have to make
sure that the since the voice of the
people is heard we got to make sure it
says the right thing and as he puts it
propaganda they used to call it frankly
in those days propaganda is in a
democracy has approximately the role of
force has in a military run State or a
totalitarian state it's a way of keeping
the bewildered herd under control
Reinhold Niebuhr they great respected
theologian the Guru called the
theologian of the establishment his
position was that the he said the the
cool observers you know the rational and
cool observers again a small group have
the responsibility of creating necessary
illusions and emotionally potent
oversimplifications
to keep the rabble on course because
they're Jews and this is all done very
benignly the problem is that the mass of
the population is just too stupid to
know what's good for them and if you let
them be something more than spectators
they'll just get in trouble so out of
our benevolence we will create necessary
illusions and propaganda
the various devices of thought control
to keep them out of things just keep
them out of trouble every once in a
while they're allowed to come and lend
their weight to one or another of us but
then they go back to being spectators
that's democracy that goes way back to
the 17th century you can trace all of
this back to the first democratic
revolution in modern history actually
the 17th century uprising in England
which caused huge amount of fear among
elites who we're concerned about what
they called the rascal multitude beasts
and men's shape you know go and do all
kind of horrible things they had to be
crushed and returned to subordination
and then we could have democracy and it
goes right up till the present it's a
major strain and democratic theory and
probably the dominant strain now it does
have various wings there's a liberal
wing and a sort of harsher wing and a
softer wing at the liberal side you get
people like say John Locke who's noted
as a libertarian theorist but what
people often don't remember is that
beside his avocation
you know writing essays on philosophy
which is what you read in college he
also had a vocation he had a job his job
was in the colonial civil service and in
that job he did things like write
constitutions for the American colonies
say the Constitution of the caroline's
and there he expressed what he really
thought so for example in the
Constitution of the caroline's citizens
are not permitted to discuss public
affairs they were allowed to know about
them but they're not allowed to discuss
them that's a crime now that makes them
a liberal they're allowed to know about
them in the modern times that comes down
to the Lippmann position you are allowed
to be a spectator no you can sort of
watch you're allowed to do that on the
conservative side what's called
conservative as conservatives another
term like democracy I mean the meaning
of conservative is exactly the opposite
of what it's applied to what are called
conservatives today our believer people
who believe in a very powerful
interventionist state
which is protected from scrutiny and
intervenes massively in economic affairs
and so on and so forth some reason
that's called conservative which you
know almost the exact opposite of what
conservatism is but anyway continue with
the doctrine correct usage the
Conservatives their view is that the
spectators shouldn't even be allowed to
know what's going on so when you get a
something like say the Reagan years they
don't believe that the spectators are
even allowed to watch and therefore
policy you get a which it typically get
and conservative like a Reagan
administration's striking you get a
great increase in clandestine operations
or what are clandestine operations
I mean suppose you're running a
clandestine terror and Nicaragua it's
not secret to anybody down there and you
know they see it it's not secret to
anybody else in the world its funding it
or whatever in facts not secret to
anybody except the American population
operations are clandestine because you
got to keep the bewildered herd from
knowing about them they're not even
allowed to know what's going on the
Reagan administration also set up the
largest state propaganda agency in
American history the office of public
diplomacy it was called the purpose of
which was to control the public mind
they were actually to demonize the
Sandinistas primarily it was finally
exposed and of course declared illegal
and so on and a high administration
official who was asked about it said
well you know it's the kind of activity
that you carry out in enemy territory
which is exactly right the general
public is enemy territory and you gotta
control the the Reagan administration
impose you know there's a regular
procedure by which the State Department
declassified documents from thirty years
of technical theoretically it's supposed
to be thirty years ago and they run
through documents and they get
Declassified by some procedure and they
don't be classify everything but they do
quite a lot and the Reagan
administration imposed constraints so
harsh that the whole group of State
Department historians who are very
conservative lot resigned in protest
because they couldn't release
information from what had happened
thirty years ago
was a big flap about it in the
diplomatic history journals and so on
well you know that's the right-wing side
of the spectrum the bewildered herd
shouldn't even know what's happening the
more liberal side says yeah they can
know but they're not allowed to talk
about it or they're not do anything
about it except occasionally vote so
that's essentially that's the spectrum
and the actually in it you get an
interesting picture of how this is
supposed to work by taking a look at the
Republican convention that just took
place which was quite interesting from
this point of view ountry obviously you
know it started off with this God and
country rally which was a real throwback
to you know actually was a throwback to
the 1930s very reminiscent of Hitler
Germany that was noticed in Europe
incidentally then along even by
conservatives in Europe then along came
the platform which was taken over by
Evangelic extremists of a kind to do
anything exist in most industrial
societies so they were given the program
and you know then you get this really
gonna have a religious war and so on and
so forth I mean it was interesting
commentary about it in Europe but for
those who if you look at it with a
little bit of a historical perspective
it's not unfamiliar I mean in in periods
where it's necessary to disperse and
suppress the mass of the population it's
always been quite common to use what are
sometimes called psychic processes of
counter-revolution that's EP Thompson's
phrase and his study of how in the early
stages of industrialization in England
it was necessary to disperse and
suppress the working classes large
religious enthusiasm was a large part of
that it's a way to kind of disperse some
control people and the Republican
convention was very striking in that
respect the way it used these techniques
the point is you've got to keep people's
attention away from what's going on
around them that's the main thing
and when any it's a principle it's
almost like a principle
political theory that if any government
any state is carrying out policies and
is intent on carrying out policies that
are going to be harmful to the mass of
the population it's going to necessary
to tell at Aryan State or a democratic
state or whatever it's just it's a
systematic fact an institutional fact
that it's going to have to turn to
policies which will distract distract
and divert the population they can't be
paying attention to what's happening
around them or they just gonna tolerate
it and there aren't a lot of ways to do
this which is why you see the same
patterns recurring over and over one way
to do it is to frighten everybody to
death you know so you have people
cowering in terror usually over foreign
enemies gonna destroy them and then the
grand hero rescues them at the last
minute and while this whole drama is
going on at least they're not paying
attention to what's going on around them
you know that pattern was re-enacted
every year - during the 1980s I mean we
had they kept setting up conference
totally fabricated confrontations with
Libya is very convenient it's like a
punching bag they can't shoot back do
anything you like to them Sandinistas
we're gonna be marching on Texas Grenada
was gonna cut off sea lanes you know you
remember that stage that crazed Arabs
all over the place you know
Hispanic narco traffickers are gonna get
us one thing after another just to keep
people terrified and was more of a
problem in the 80s than it had been in
earlier years because in earlier years
he could always appeal to the Russians I
mean maybe the threat was fabricated but
at least they were there you know and
they were brutal and strong and so on in
the 1980s they were visibly disappearing
and that was a big problem so therefore
we had this turning out different
different chimeras to defend yourself
again and it sort of works I mean the
American population is probably the most
frightened population in the world
I mean you know in fact it became a joke
in Europe every couple of years the
tourism industry would collapse because
Americans are afraid to travel to Europe
you know were there about a hundred
times as safe as in any American city
because maybe somebody's going to be
behind the thing ready to kill him or
something and you know the right-wing
European press was quite comical on this
I remember I went to England just
happened by accident I was giving going
to England happen to be the day that the
bombing of Iraq started and article
links there ultra right-wing spectator
which was talking about how some group
of American gun collectors you know guys
who run around with assault rifles or
something we're planning a meeting in
Scotland but they'd cancelled it because
they were afraid you know they were
afraid to travel to Scotland because you
know who knows maybe there's maybe
saying I'll get you or something like
that that's and that's typical and
understandable you want to keep people's
attention a wait I mean we know what's
been going on in the last 10 years I
mean you know you know the way incomes
been redistributed you can see the way
infrastructure is collapsing and you can
see what's happening to people's lives
but people had better not look at that
they better look at something else there
are other ways of doing it too you can
look at a domestic enemy that's been
used to now we don't I mean well you
know you read the way it's been done
here's a couple of examples which say
you attack liberalism it's big things to
attack liberalism here's some quotes
liberalism with its demands for women's
equality and denial of the ancient truth
that a woman's world is her husband her
family her children in her home i watch
out about that it's a sin against the
will of the almighty that hundreds upon
thousands of his most gifted creatures
should be made to sink in the
proletarian swamp while Negroes from
Africa are trained for the liberal
professions you know what I'm quoting
that's Hitler you know but how different
is it you know that was Hitler giving
talks at women's conferences in 1936 and
so on and so forth
strike some resonances we're not the
code words are a little different
but the the thoughts are very similar
and the reasons are the same the segment
of the mass of the population is under
attack by state policy and therefore
they have to be mobilized somehow you
can't get them interested in what's
going on around them that would be
disaster so what you have to do is
construct is is frighten them turn them
against each other create hatreds it's
very familiar there are not many devices
available and that's why you keep seeing
the same ones over and over again
religious enthusiasm is an old one goes
back to the 18th and 19th century
evangelicals and Central America do the
same thing you want to undermine
Liberation Theology and you know the
preferential option for the poor or the
church what you do is send people down
to create what's sometimes called the
Chile Azzam of despair nothing good is
ever going to happen to you in this life
forget it you'll be ok in the next life
I mean that central message it's done
with proper kinds of enthusiasm and
excitement and speaking in tongues and
so on that's another technique the
techniques over the centuries are not
very different and if you look at the
United States today you see them
manifested and for exactly the
structural reasons that always make them
manifest it namely what's happening in
the society right now and what's
happening we know it's captured rather
nicely in a lead article in New York
Times business section a couple of days
ago which is called the headline is
paradox of 92 the paradox of 92 is that
here's the subheading weak economy
strong profits paradox of 92 and it
starts off America is not doing very
well but it's corporations are doing
just fine paradox completely
inexplicable you know like some act of
nature or something like that well you
know it's it's not at all paradoxical
it's the exact consequence you expect
when policy is being created by the
people who are going to make the
prophets who are untroubled by the
public because they're marginalized the
way they're supposed to be they're out
of it you know they're distracted or
something at least that's what's
supposed to happen to them this this
paradox of 92 is now being translated
directly into policy in other ways so
there's this phenomenon called going on
called the globalization of production
and everybody's supposed to know that us
that the us us industry is declining us
manufacturing is declining well you know
again if that's either true or false
depending on how you define us if by us
you mean the people in the United States
that's true
US manufacturing is declining
significantly if by us you mean the
people who own the country it's
increasing so if you take the share in
world manufacturing trade of US owned
corporations
it's either stable or increasing that's
another paradox just depends on which US
you mean and the way it's happening is
not secret I mean today for example in
the world's leading business paper the
Financial Times of London there's an
article hidden away there which
describes some what General Motors is
now up to they've just closed 21 plants
in the United States but they're opening
a big plant in East Germany and it
explains why a lot of rhetoric but you
get down to the end that explains it
very clearly wages are 40 percent lower
than they are in West Germany there are
no benefits there are higher hours
there's over 40 percent unemployment so
you can be sure to get people no matter
how rotten the conditions are now that
Eastern Europe has been returned to its
proper position in the third world as a
service area GM can use it the same way
they use Mexico you get super cheap
labor its Eastern Europe's that are
pretty well trained with a pretty
healthy and so on like a domain
and then for 40% lower wages you can
make good profits you might as well
close down the factories in the United
States or since they're talking about
Europe they say so that the pampered
West German workers will have to have
their standards undercut they're not
supposed to live hampered the way they
are with you know wages and decent wages
and vacations and so on and Eastern
European labor can be used to undercut
them the same way that Mexican labor
that high repression areas where state
violence is used to keep wages down the
same way that that goes on in the United
States if you want to see a graphic
picture of how it's done in Central
America I'd urge you to look at CBS 60
minutes this Sunday unless they chicken
out at the last minute they're supposed
to have a segment on on I don't want to
give it away but it'll be interesting if
they run in I'll tell you about it later
that's part of the on Central America
and the youth way the US Embassy's
helping firms move down to Central
America so that they can undercut wages
and benefits for US workers that's
essentially what it's about the a major
feature of all of this is the raising of
planning to a level where it's
completely invisible to people so there
is what are the financial press is
sometimes calling a new Imperial age
developing in which the major policies
are not taken by state by government
institutions but by transnational
institutions either the transnational
corporations or else the g7 meetings you
know the meetings of the big seven
industrial powers or the GATT
negotiations or the IMF or the World
Bank that's where the big global
decisions are made which are then just
translated down into policy in the
individual countries now in the third
world they just follow orders but this
is supposed to apply even to the
industrial countries and the so-called
free trade arrangements which are not
that are a device to a significant
extent to subordinate national planning
which has the danger that
however repressive they maybe have the
defect that they may come under popular
pressure that defect is never eliminated
corporations don't have that problem
GATT doesn't have that problem you know
the international trade negotiations the
IMF doesn't have that problem so that's
where that's where decisions ought to be
vested and within the framework that
they establish the governments can you
know maneuver around a little space
that's left to them well notice that
this is a move towards the harsher end
of the Democratic spectrum the end that
says that people should not the
spectators should not even be allowed to
know what's happening I don't know how
many if you read the discussions of the
GATT negotiations in Geneva but I'll bet
not many however that's where the
decisions are being made and fortunately
they're totally out of any threat of
democratic control and you'll simply
have to adhere to them because they're
being made by the people who own the
world not just the country and that's
the way it's supposed to run well how
does the last thing how's the population
react to all of this it's an interesting
question we don't know a lot about it
because people are not supposed to say
anything we're supposed to be watching
television or something but this is a
but we do happen to know a lot about it
first of all you know in personal
experience but there's also a lot of
studies business is a very heavily
studied country because business wants
to keep its finger on the public pulse
so they want to have everything
everybody's thinking and we're
constantly pulled all the time most of
the polls are just for business use but
they're interesting and if you look at
them you find some quite intriguing
things so for exact that we have served
as the inspiration for the triumph of
democracy in our time remember that's
what the intellectuals say well does the
public think we are the inspiration for
democracy in our time is that the way
the public looks at our political
institutions well the ways the same time
on that one however more interesting is
a more general point the Harris Poll
stud every year has a range of questions
which test what they call alienation
from institutions a measure of whether
you
which you think that any institutions
political economic social are doing
anything for you or you have anything to
do with them and that number keeps going
up in 1991 the last one it hit its peak
so far two-thirds of the population
thinks that none of the institution's
involve them economic social anything
political it's much higher nobody thinks
the political institutions do anything
the the individual questions are
interesting people who were asked you
know what do you think about the economy
83% of the population regards the
economic system as inherent inherently
unfair you know something fundamentally
wrong with it well you know that's not
the kind of issue that can show up in a
campaign I mean no candidate can come
and say look our problem is our economic
institutions they're inherently unfair
I mean maybe 83% of the population
thinks it but you know nobody's going to
say that because that's not conducive to
the needs of the people who own the
country and therefore have to run it in
fact the reporter who reported this
actually he couldn't even either he
couldn't see it or he couldn't never
suppress it he said well what this means
is people are opposed to their overpaid
politicians well that's not what they
were saying they're not saying we're
paying we're opposed to our overpaid
politicians we're saying the economic
system is inherently unfair that's much
deeper you know and you can understand
why all the decisions are out of public
control I mean nobody makes any
decisions about investment or production
or distribution or whatever that's
completely out of public control and
people can see the consequences you know
they look around then you see the
consequences right through the Reagan
years people were regularly asked
attitudes which come down through
basically social democracy like how do
you feel about expenditures for welfare
or an education and military and taxes
and so on and the answers were quite
steady there was a steady drift right
through the Reagan years towards more
Social Democratic position that is more
spending for social needs less spending
formula
people were willing by and large to
accept higher taxes for spending for
education and welfare and so on while
all this is going on you know the l word
is following the S word into oblivion it
doesn't matter that the population is
going the other way the people who the
people who care the people the
responsible men are going their way and
their way is power has to get vested
even more than before
in the narrow sectors of privilege and
the population has to be marginalized so
it doesn't matter what the general
population thinks as long as they don't
do anything about it
as long as they're scattered and
dispersed which they are you can see it
on the issues that are now lively in the
election campaign like every day there's
more Clinton bashing about the draft
very striking what Clinton doesn't say
he doesn't say look I thought the
Vietnam War was not am was not a mistake
wasn't a noble cause it wasn't even a
mistake I thought it was fundamentally
wrong and immoral and I honored the
people who wouldn't fight in it they
won't say that is that an exotic opinion
well it's the opinion of 70% of the
population that the war is not a mistake
but it's fundamentally wrong and immoral
and remarkably that figure has
maintained itself nobody ever hears that
you know nobody would say that I mean
you can read maybe again at the outer
limits you can read Anthony Lewis
telling you the war started with
blundering efforts to do good but it by
1969 we realized it was too costly to
ourselves so we had to pull out you can
hear that but try to find somebody who
says it was fundamentally wrong and
immoral not a mistake well that's the
position of 70% of the population right
through the Reagan years you know I mean
actually in the peak of the Reagan years
went down to 66% now it's back to 70 170
it's a resilient figure but nobody can
express it publicly
it may be people's individual opinion
but it's not a collective opinion you
know I'd like to have it collectively
just like you're not allowed to think
collectively that the economic system is
inherently unfair the same was
incidentally true on the Iraq war
up until the like the last polls were
taken a day or
before the bombing the public was 2 to 1
in favor 2 to 1 in favor of a negotiated
settlement which would involve Iraqi
withdrawal from quate in the context of
international conference on Middle East
problems now suppose that people had
known that two weeks before Iraq had
made that proposal it had been released
by US officials and the u.s. had flatly
rejected it suppose people had known
that that's exactly what Iraqi Democrats
were calling for then the figure
wouldn't have been 2 to 1 it would have
been 98 percent you know but nobody knew
it costs the press did its job it was
totally suppressed I mean had been
suppressed since the preceding August
the President had said there will be no
negotiation so everyone it was like a
hundred percent you know statistical
error here and there but that is close
to 100 percent as you can come in a
complicated system marched on command
everything was suppressed no negotiation
nevertheless individually people wanted
that not collectively and so it goes on
issue after issue I won't continue but
there's a crucial there's a striking
fact in societies that do not have
functioning democracy namely individual
opinions are completely different than
collective opinions on issue after issue
the collective opinion the one that's
articulated and can be expressed then
people think they you know yeah I mean
that's the banner they'll march behind
because nobody wants to be crazy you
want to be like everybody else so you
believe that everybody else was the
collective opinion those differ
radically from what people think in
their you know when they're isolated now
that's always been understood and it has
always been understood that the way to
ensure that democracy doesn't work is is
to prevent people from coming together
this has been understood on all sides
it's been understood by the business
classes you want to keep people isolated
and separated ideal is everybody sits
alone in their living room looking at
the two you know no popular associations
no unions no political clubs nothing
like that
everybody isolate then they think what
they want they can
whatever individual opinions they want
will run the collective opinions it's
also understood on the other side so for
example one of the main wobbly writers
and nobody reads because Rob Lee says 50
years ago that the papers have taken us
one at a time and convinced us how good
the times are we have no opportunity to
consult our neighbor to find if the
press speaks the truth well that's the
trick make sure there's no opportunities
to consult your neighbor in fact that's
the genius of American democracy you
take a look at the elections that are
going on people come up and say vote for
me I'll do XY and Z nobody much believes
them but what doesn't happen is more
interesting what doesn't happen is
people get together and their unions or
their political clubs or their churches
or whatever other organizations they
have and work out collectively together
their ideas about what ought to happen
in the country and every respect and
then put forth representatives who are
going to advocate their positions I mean
that's unthinkable we don't have
mechanisms for that we don't have the
the whole idea can't exist but that's
also democracy and anything short of
that is not democracy anything short of
that is the the wildered heard being
asked every once in a while to lend
their weight to one or another leader
it's in that respect that we are you
know that we're back to the sense in
which we're an inspiration to democracy
in our time not in that kind sense of
democracy not in the sense in which the
general population can actually
participate in determining policy
setting policy having ideas having
thoughts working them out with other
people putting them in the political
arena and having them represented that
not well this discussion is about
erosion of democracy and in some
respects it has been eroding over the
last thirty years but just final comment
we should bear in mind that it's not
uniform there's plenty of tension things
will also been going in the opposite
direction so there is much more public
awareness and concern and even active
then there was a 30 years ago
dramatically more you can see it in
every area when which you look takes a
October 1992 big month coming along the
commemoration of 500 years of European
world conquest
if that had taken place in 1962 it would
be exactly what had always been in the
past a celebration of the liberation of
the hemisphere it's not going to be that
this time fact it won't be much of what
at all but it's now been downgraded to
an encounter not a liberation and there
are plenty of people who know that it
was an encounter pretty much in the
sense in which the Warsaw Ghetto was an
encounter plenty of people know that too
so there's this certainly won't be a
celebration that's for sure that's a big
change over 30 years it's the first time
in 500 years that that has taken place
that level of awareness and
understanding of what the conquest meant
and that's a very important consequence
of a significant rise in the cultural
level of the general population and
since the 1960s which shows up in all
sorts of other respects as well I mean
the feminist movement the environmental
movement the Solidarity movements with
Central America we're a striking case
all of this has changed the general
public quite considerably and people in
power are aware of it the and they're
worried about it I'm convinced that part
of the reason for this very carefully
orchestrated PC campaign has been fear
you know real fear that people are
getting out of control I mean there
really are people you know around who
aren't in who don't like racist and
sexist repression and who have respect
for other cultures and who don't think
you oughta murder everybody in sight
there are all these bad people around
and it's hard to suppress them so we'll
scream about them being politically
correct or you know left fascists or
something or other but none of it works
you know oh and the the attempt to you
know build up the fears and the
enthusiasms and so on it's still not
working
you still have 70% of the population
thinking contrary that their betters
that the Vietnam War is what it was no
fundamentally wrong and immoral not a
mistake you still have a situation in
which the government recognizes that
although there's no deterrent to the use
of force anymore with the Russians out
of the game they can't use it because as
the Bush administration put it in a
leaked early document when we confront
much weaker enemies we must defeat them
rapidly and decisively because anything
else will undercut political support
it's not like the early 60s when you get
bombed South Vietnam for years before
anybody batted in my life now you got to
get it over with fast no casualties huge
propaganda campaign to demonize the
enemy and then get done with it because
the population doesn't tolerate it
anymore well these are developments that
are important they don't have any
institutional reflection they're
cultural in some fashion but I think
they're quite important and it sets up a
tension tension between people who have
are committed to continuing what has
been a long long struggle centuries-long
struggle to defend the freedoms that
they've got and to extend them and their
democratic rights and on the other side
powerful forces who will continue their
systematic efforts to erase such rights
and anything but form and how that
struggle comes out I will as always
determine whether there is to be a world
fit for human existence
[Applause]
I think ultimately they will but it's
gonna be a rocky road right now
Maastricht doesn't look in let cards but
in the long term they'll do it I think
because it you know they just unless
there are some real changes in the
popular scene you know reorganization of
significant popular forces the direction
in which things are going is to raise
the level of decision-making out of
public control that's true at every
level
well England doesn't want it because
partly because see the British remember
England is a little bit out of Europe
England is more like the United States
they were subjected to Reaganite
policies in the 1980s so they're a
disaster area like the United States is
for the same reason the same is true of
Australia there are they sort of most
most often the Western countries don't
take their free-market rhetoric
seriously they understand that this is
just a rhetorical device to suppress
people with it's not for us it's just
with a third world but occasionally they
make the mistake of taking semi
seriously at least their rhetoric and
when they do it's always a disaster just
like it's a disaster for the third world
or Eastern Europe no they never do it
much you know but they do to some extent
and written like the United States and
Australia did it to some extent in the
80s so you've got you know huge debt at
every level and collapse of the social
base and you know all the usual problems
that show up typically under structural
adjustment in the third world therefore
they can't compete with Europe you know
Europe maintain the kind of social
contract has more powerful with unions
and so on I mean it's like a generation
behind in this process so it's still
functioning and England is in trouble
if you listen to the parliamentary
debate today over the radio you could
hear
and also England has illusions that
Europe doesn't have England had it was
the great power you know he ran the
world and they still have illusions
about that England has had illusions
about a special relationship with the
United States ever since the Second
World War
u.s. planners regarded as a joke I mean
in the internal record do you get people
like England is their lieutenants the
fashionable well the British but they
still think they're somehow our party
partners are the big guy on the street
and so they don't so for a number of
reasons some of them kind of historical
this is others the impact of
they're natural they're not in a good
position for joining Europe that's why
they had to pull out of the council
under the pound was just couldn't say
Italy however I my feeling is they'll
get back together it's just too
important for the transnational
corporations and the other major power
units
oh yeah I just simply ask yourself who
what about what was the purpose in
allowing the u.s. to fall so much into
debt well one answer is given if you
simply ask the question who owns the
debt and who's going to pay it okay well
the people are gonna pay the debt are
the poor the people who they're gonna
pay it to are the rich
I mean who owns the Treasury securities
and you know the bonds and so on so that
the debt itself is a kind of transfer of
resources from the poor to the rich
furthermore the debt has consequences
they were actually described quite
frankly if you remember about ten years
ago by David Stockman when he was kicked
out of the government he said look the
debt puts a cap on social spending I
mean there is we want to stop anything I
mean this is going to be a welfare state
for the rich no more it always is but
more than before it's going to be a
welfare state for the rich which means
we'll have plenty of subsidies for the
Pentagon and all that kind of stuff well
the state intervention for the rich
which is the big welfare program but
will cut down on the pennies that go to
the poor and the way you make sure that
there's a cap on those programs is to be
so deeply in debt that there's no money
around and that's work I mean even if
somebody came along who wasn't a
business candidate right now there's not
a lot they could do you know the the
parameters have been set so narrowly
that there are no social policies that
can be carried out very much anymore
because we're just do deeply in debt
the debt probably went well beyond what
any planners rationally wanted I mean it
got to the level of household debt you
know individual that is it a level which
has no historical president I mean
corporate that had reached very high
levels I think it's picking up it's
recovering now you know but at every
level federal state local you know
that is enormous I mean so much so
that's I think I'm just just about old
enough to remember the Great Depression
and my age or older will remember that
things were bad but they weren't like
now like you know you weren't finding
that I mean I'm starting to get letters
from people in American cities of the
kind I get from the third world where
people say could you send me a book you
know the public library in Sacramento is
closed down and that's the kind of
letter you get from Central Africa you
know now you're starting to get it from
places like Sacramento major American
cities because that's true public
services have shut down there there
aren't the libraries that were in 1930s
you know the trains don't run you can't
walk in the park yeah
the schools are collapsing the next big
target is the school I mean it's called
privatization but it's a technique to
ensure that the public doesn't get the
services because the public is
irrelevant the public has been dismissed
as irrelevant services should go to the
wealthy so you'll privatize the schools
and the ritual get what they want and
the general public they can the only
only one service has to be maintained
for the poor prisons which have to be
increased so we've had this huge rise in
prison population we're now way ahead of
anybody else in the world we passed
South Africa years ago and that is good
because that gets rid of a large part of
the irrelevant population it also
incidentally gives a kind of Keynesian
stimulus to the economy it's a big boost
to the construction business people like
us have been talking about conversion
for years have never really been talking
a lot of sense pentagon expenditures are
very functional that's the way you
maintain high-tech industry you make the
public pay the costs and then if there's
anything that comes out of it goes to
private corporations but it's harder to
do that now through the Pentagon system
you need other measures of stimulation
of the economy the federal highway
building program was one and a big one
it ran
I think of well over 100 billion dollars
I had enormous effects on the country as
well as subsidizing the construction
industry well prisons are doing it too
it subsidizes the construction industry
it even creates employment the
fastest-growing white-collar job in the
United States is security guard and it
keeps lots of people out of out of the
way so that kind of service can maybe
increase but not things like schools or
hospitals or anything libraries you know
things that serve the undeserving public
now you know the death is part of this
I'm not saying that somebody sat down
and thought yes there's going to be all
the consequence it's just the natural
result of orienting state policies even
more than usual toward the wealthy
sector that are the only ones that count
with a situation
you put it on the light at the end
I don't think it's impossible I just
think it's in part I'm sort of playing
I mean I'm maybe not doing it skillfully
but I'm trying to be two characters at
once one of whom is speaking from the
point of view of the rulers and the way
they're looking at things and the other
from the point of view of what the
general public would it do for the deaf
there's no reason for anybody to accept
the framework in which decisions are
made on any issue people have never
accepted in the past and that's why we
don't live under slavery you know I mean
anything that's decent that's ever
happened and plenty of decent things
have happened remember it still is the
freest country in the world and it got
that way because of struggle not because
somebody wrote things down on paper I
mean take say freedom speech the United
States is as far as I know the freest
country in the world in with regard to
freedom of speech we have rights of
freedom of speech they just don't have
anywhere else at least nowhere else that
I know of
but it didn't get that way because
somebody wrote something down on paper I
mean the law of seditious libel which
makes it a crime to criticize people in
government you know it's like it's a
crime that's basically what it amounts
to
you can assault the government by speech
that's what seditious libel is most
countries still have that we had it
until 1964 and it was overcome file of
course the Supreme Court struck it down
but they didn't do it in a vacuum they
did in the course of the civil rights
struggle you know there's a big civil
rights movement which had gotten to the
point where the Supreme Court simply had
to strike down the law of seditious
libel in a civil rights case well you
know that's the way every other
victories been won - and so far they you
know and it goes around all sorts of
things that still does not hit the part
of the society
economic institutions they've been
insulated and we're not even allowed to
look at them you know we're not allowed
to think that there's something
inherently wrong with the economic
institutions again individually people
think it now and the extent to which
they think it is kind of remarkable
there let me give you one last poll
result which is intriguing in the
mid-80s there was a study done in which
that people were asked what they thought
was in the Constitution you know nobody
knows what's in the Constitution you
know but people regard the Constitution
it's kind of Holy Writ
you know so if something is completely
an obvious truth must be in the
Constitution that's the kind of response
you get and it was interesting to look
at the end there giving a lot of
statements do you think this is in the
Constitution or not well one of them
that half the population thinks is in
the Constitution because it's such an
obvious truism is the statement from
each according to his ability to each
according to his needs
half the population thinks that such an
obvious truths got to be in the
Constitution you know well you know try
try expressing that individual thought
publicly I mean it really takes work to
try to you really you can see why how
important it is to separate people from
one another but of course that's the way
change takes place too by overcoming
that separation
I think say the media you know they're
not worse than they were thirty years
ago or a hundred years ago you start
reading them I mean I just happened in
reading the press from about a hundred
years ago because of the you know
because the homestead's strike breaking
there's a hundredth anniversary of the
breaking of the American labor movement
at homestead in 1892 and you know then
after 50 years kind of revived and now
it's been destroyed again so it's
interesting and I was looking at the
newspapers back then and you know
they're much worse than they are now I
mean you know they were just viciously
anti-labor and anti-worker and racist
and everything else furthermore at that
time you had something he didn't have
now you had hundreds of Labor newspapers
big ones
I mean Appeal to Reason the big
socialist party paper had I think two
million subscribers or something like
that huge number of subscribers and
these were professionally done theirs
I mean some of them were ethnic some
were religious some were you know some
were coming out of parties and when and
you know just had big parts of the
population at other places they could go
to get a picture of the world well you
know it took a hundred years about 60
years to destroy that and if and that's
the destruction of that is part of the
reason why when caterpillar workers in
Peoria were this last June something
quite important in American history
happened for the first time in 60 years
an American corporation was willing to
bring in scabs to destroy a major Union
UAW hasn't happened for a long time
well when the caterpillar workers who
you know who had built the OREA I mean
that the reason Peoria is not a
miserable slum is because of 60 years of
union organizing they found that they
had no support in the community okay
that's a big ideological victory for the
business classes the idea that you
should have some solid air that the idea
of solidarity of support for others that
you care about somebody else to a
significant extent that's been wiped out
of people's heads but it can be put back
in again just like it always was I mean
that's you know that's the constant
struggle that goes on I mean you take a
look at the history of slavery no slave
revolt after slavery volts I'm gonna put
down put down viciously violently okay
finally slavery was overthrown first in
Haiti actually part of the reason why
Haiti is suffering so much now is
because of the Western reaction to that
victorious slave revolt which terrified
the Western world us didn't itself
didn't recognize Haiti for 60 years
it's really it's not important I mean
there's a kind of a right-wing mythology
about the trilateral commission but it's
mostly mythology I mean I used to read
all their stuff but frankly I stopped
because we're so boring it's I mean it's
a kind of talk session among rich people
and their lackeys of the more or less
liberal side you know and they say
pretty much the kind of things you'd
expect them to say I mean occasionally
they let their hair down and say things
more openly like in this crisis of
democracy book but it's pretty rare I
mean mostly it's not very different from
what you read in the literature the
Council on Foreign Relations or you know
the the main intellectual journals I
mean it's sort of the liberal side of
the International ruling class but it
it's not that they plan the world or
anything you know just a lot of rich
guys who get together every now and then
and talk
but Bush - yeah yeah mm-hmm it's not
surprising because almost anybody
semi-rational is associated with the
trilateral commission see the trilateral
commission came out in the 1970s out of
a real phenomenon you know what you
can't laugh out namely the world had
become trilateral or tri-polar as it's
now called I mean around 1970 there was
a big change
you know much bigger than the end of the
Cold War by 1970 from 1945 to 1970 you
know over that period there was a kind
of a period of affluence of growth you
know in the capitalistic state
capitalist economies and it was under US
domination by 1970 that was pretty well
over that sometimes called the end of
the affluent alliance there were severe
pressures on corporate profits high
growth rates were never resumed the
economies have been sort of stagnating
ever since real wages in the US have
been actually declining since then and
the u.s. mainly because of the Vietnam
War was no longer able to be the kind of
centerpiece of the world economy the US
had been the international banker
basically couldn't maintain that
position by 1970 Nixon in August 1971
dismantled the entire international
system the Bretton Woods system that had
been established at the end of the
second world war in which the US was the
banker of last resort
he dismantled it he introduced import
surcharges he changed the goal the
dollar had been $35 an ounce you know
that was fixed the fixed rate for
international funds he eliminated that
it began to float there's a whole series
of changes that were made that
essentially eliminated the International
economy and the world because and it was
a reflection of the fact that the world
was try polar or becoming dry polar you
know with a german-based sector and a
Japan based sector and a US based sector
well you know anybody who had their head
screwed on could see that and the
trilateral commission was just one
reflection of that of that fact so of
course everybody was some kind of
trilateral list maybe not everyone
joined the Commission but you know the
Commission wasn't all that unusual it
was just the sort of more liberal side
of this group as long as people don't
walk out okay I'll try to be a little
briefer I can't really see very well
back
[Music]
seven yeah 1990 well the phrase was the
question people here's this story people
are given a set of it's on all foreign
policy issues you know there's a study
of all foreign policy issues it's done
every four years by the Gallup
Organization
that's an interesting study and each on
each topic you're given a set of choices
and the question is and you're supposed
to say which one do I strongly agree
with or you know that kind of and the
one the one in question was in the
Vietnam War there's a set of choices
like you know a noble cause whatever one
of them that the extreme is fun not a
mistake but fundamentally wrong a
tomorrow are that one's been running
over two-thirds of the population in
1982 it was 72% in 1986 it went down the
66% that was after four years of
reaganism I just yesterday saw the one
for 1990 which just came out it's back
up to 71% not a mistake fundamentally
wrong a tomorrow see the farthest out
you can get in the intellectual
community is it was a mistake okay so if
you take a look at you know articulate
people people who come you know people
who people who are considered articulate
dissidents they'll say yeah I was a
mistake but the public doesn't they say
it was not a mistake it was
fundamentally wrong and immoral which is
correct
it wasn't it wasn't it was it was it's
not a mistake anymore the invasion of
Afghanistan was a mistake of course the
invasion of Afghanistan was a mistake
but that's not the problem with it you
know the problem with it is it was
fundamentally wrong and tomorrow we can
see that about Afghanistan and most of
the population here can see it about
Vietnam which is very interesting
because they never heard it you know
they can just think it individually I'm
sure that if they if you ask people does
anybody else think that are just you
they'd say I'm the only person world
thinks it it happens to be 71 percent of
the population
he can't well he couldn't because he
would be cut off from his business
supporters you know he's after all a
representative the business community
they don't want people to think that
what prevents it
of authoritarian
yeah that's an interesting question yeah
you know well there are a lot of factors
I mean yeah the question is what
prevents people from getting organized
and associated and you know what she
gave the example of UMass Boston a
working-class school which is being
smashed like every popular institution
but the students who are getting smashed
don't want to do anything about it
they're apathetic and the specific
question was if I heard you right what
is the role of authoritarianism
authoritarian ideology in this well you
know I I mean I don't want to try to
give a glib answer or even pretend that
I know the answer I don't but if you
look at American history I mean you know
organizing is not easy it is by no means
easy I mean the organization of unions
which is in one of the main kinds of
organizing was a bitter brutal struggle
hundreds of the United States happens to
have an unusually violent labor history
I think hundreds probably thousands of
American workers were simply murdered
during a period when almost nobody was
killed in Europe I mean it wasn't until
8 1935 with the Wagner Act that American
workers finally got the rights that had
been granted in Europe in the late 19th
century you know that's why the
homestead affair are so interesting I
don't want to call it a strike which
everybody calls it because it wasn't it
was a lockout but the homestead lockout
a hundred years ago which destroyed the
American steel Workers Union very
important event nobody know it ought to
be
everybody wouldn't know about it it's
one of the most important events in
American history we just had a hundredth
anniversary and it was a very you know
they called in the National Guard to
destroy the Union and they killed a lot
of people that was the end of it there
was nothing else in Homestead until 1935
that's during that period there was
plenty of brutal repression in 1919
under Woodrow Wilson doesn't he do with
liberals and conservatives incidentally
Wilson was supposed to be aggressive
that was probably the most violent
period in anti lay in labor history
there was a violent repression under
Wilson which destroyed other post-war
attempt for old war attempts to organize
it destroy the independent press they
kicked thousands of people out of the
country I mean there was this Red Scare
it was called and it was brutal
you know we then went into ten years of
almost total apathy in the 1930s people
got started organizing again it was
again brutal I mean after the Wagner Act
in 1935 the next strike wave in 1936 and
37 they were mostly suppressed and often
by violence a lot of workers were killed
and a little steel strikes in 1937 and
that's why it goes yeah you know killing
is just the superficial you know that's
like the icing on the cake I mean
there's plenty of repression short of
killing and it's tough you know people
lose their jobs they get blacklisted
they get if you try it in the university
you know you probably you'll get they
may not officially blacklist you but you
get into trouble you know there's all
kind of ways of getting rid of people
who are troublemakers from kindergarten
on up you know and and organizing
succeeds when people are willing to face
those pressures and overcome them and
it's hard to know what the secret is
sometimes people do it yeah I mean you
take a look at places where people
really you know we're I mean we for us
that's a picnic what we call repression
and most of the world would be called a
gift you know I mean go to a place like
say El Salvador and try to organize
there you know there it's not a matter
of oh yeah they don't like you
I mean you end up in the you know in a
ditch cut to pieces with you know after
torture that's what it means to organize
there but they still do it they keep
coming back you know tens of thousands
slaughter and they keep coming back and
doing it again
well that's organizing and we don't you
know we can talk about repression but
we're not talking about anything real by
international standards and the question
is whether you want to put out the
energy in the effort to do it I mean it
happens because enough people this idea
they're going to do it I mean look the
anti-war movement in the 60s to take
something recent started that way
I mean it started like well remember
back around 64 or 63 when I would be
giving talks in Unitarian churches you
know in which there would be four people
one of them the organizer one of them a
drunk would walked off the street two
guys who wanted to kill me you know and
that's the way it was until but in 1966
in Boston which is a very liberal City
we couldn't have meetings in churches a
meeting in the Arlington Street Church
was attacked in March 1966 some of you
will remember and the whole church was
the face because it wasn't any war
meeting going on inside they were
students coming over marching over from
the universities Arlington Street Church
in downtown wasn't in the you know it
took a long time before things got going
and you know that's not real repression
I mean I don't want to suggest that
that's repression not right the
standards of what the US does in our
client states are not even by the
standards of what working-class
organizers have ever faced question is
whether one wants to I mean you first
thing you got to do is overcome the
mental apathy you know the belief that
there's nothing else except what they
tell you there is you know if you
believe there's nothing else except the
world depicted in television and
comedies okay then you know then they've
won if you understand look that's not
the world then comes the next question
am I going to try to do something about
it if enough people do things change
well I don't agree with it so I don't
agree but there's no you're get now
we're getting to it yeah I I agree with
everything except the bottom line I mean
let's take let's take a really harsh
institution that we don't argue about
slavery ok nobody thinks slavery was
good I presume nevertheless everything
that you just said could be said about
slavery I mean if you took a look at the
plantation economy there were masters
who were very decent people they treated
the slaves very nicely in fact they were
treated better than free workers much
better and there they were allowed to
live their family lives you know I mean
they didn't beat him up for anything but
it didn't matter
it was slavery and maybe some of them
you know gave money to the church and
did all kind of decent things probably
they did you know nice people but the
trouble was the institution the
institution was wrong it doesn't matter
whether you do it nicely or not nicely
people you know the idea that a person
should be owned is just an intolerable
infringement on human rights whether the
person who owns him is nice to them or
not and you know in the 19th century it
was widely recognized that the same is
true of people are rented it's an
intolerable infringement on people's
rights even if the guy who rents you is
nice to you the question is whether
decisions over investment production and
distribution what happens in the shop
floor conditions of work all that kind
of stuff whether those decisions are
should be out of public control you go
back to the 19th century when there was
a live popular libertarian working class
movement and you will read in the
Knights of Labor statement publications
that wage slavery is not a lot different
from slavery in fact if you bother to go
back to the origins of democratic
thought you know you really read the
classics the classics of
people claim to be classical liberals
and so on but he could back and read
this stuff you know like say go home
Clint Humboldt who was the inspiration
of John Stuart Mill he says the leading
principle of his you know the great
classical liberal you know the leading
principle of his thought is that human
beings are born to he said to enquire
and create and to create under their own
initiative any if any work that a person
does under outside pressure is inhuman
if a person creates something beautiful
under outside orders we may admire what
he does but we will despise what he is
well that's classical liberal thought
you know they don't tell you that in the
Chicago school but that's class anymore
than they tell you about Adam Smith
really said which is very different from
what's claimed but that's classical
liberal thought and it's because it was
driven by you know concepts of human
rights and human dignity z-- which are
seriously infringed by the structure of
business operations even if the guys who
rented or nice guys you can't be a nice
guy in certain positions because the
institution is not nice no I'm not you
know like I'm not saying let's go out
and blow up Lotus you know I'm sure not
not at all I mean yes among the best
ones around but that doesn't lead us to
over I should I think it should not lead
us to overlook what's fundamentally
wrong with that authoritarian structure
actually I agree with that fifty percent
of the population who thinks that that
slogan ought to be in the Constitution
the right wing talk shows yeah yeah
that's an interesting phenomenon I don't
know exactly how it work but back in
this 60s there was a much broader range
of talk-show discussions I just know
from personal experience I was animal
with time and over the years it's been
gradually shifting not just to the right
but to the freaky right you know I mean
a tremendous amount of the talk show
stuff is what's called libertarian has
nothing do with libertarianism but it's
you know real extreme right I mean if
the kind that you don't even find in
other industrial societies and they have
a very dominant role I mean I didn't do
an experiment but I know just turning
them on at random you hear this stuff
all the time whether that was a decision
or just for a natural drift or something
I really don't know might be worth
looking at
I listen to him a lot actually I think
they're kind of interesting yeah I can
I'm driving I usually try to turn in
these to not tune in to these programs
and they're often kind of interesting I
mean that I think you're getting a very
skewed part of the population
I mean snow it's not you know it's not
the random sample of the population that
sits there calling in to talk shows but
whatever sector it is you know they
reflect some interesting things now and
then stop and continue this in the ante
room there's refreshments and good times
[Applause]
[Music]
I mean
they say
at least you see
I'm looking
[Applause]
I think
probably come closer
this is happening for all societies if
you see people accepted into medical or
dental school
it's almost 50%
there's been a great
or
you know whatever
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
I'm one of those
and I had to do paper
laughing that an officer who just before
the Gulf
[Music]
the notice that you referred to
and I always thought it was fascinating
and reading the quote that she put in
there it struck me right here's a man
who's very honest
with his remarks which he gave
well the thing that I noticed about that
after you put in the quote there which I
actually
with
the government at the time okay you know
what is it that they're looking these
guys talking honestly about direct power
concepts of doing in the world you know
they thought this guy was soft in the
mouth was replaced by four minutes
well that's his first major production
was the most important if you don't want
to read the whole thing I've got one
excerpt from
and then there is this guy by comparison
but you know I guess the thing that I'm
curious about is that one find that
Kenan was saying anything rash
okay and the other the other I mean you
know Kenan was thinking about
Mitsy say look forward of death and we
got to have repression at home
the other thing I want Astra's I've
noticed recently in the news is doing a
lot of focus our goal
photochemical
I work a lot with the bathroom
Boston and they pretty much
working cooperation
but they're all pretty much vietnam-era
and what I've noticed in the media is
there seems to be a definite shift
[Applause]
[Music]
issues
into historical memory and everything
since the Gulf War if they're gonna do
any referencing on Veterans and anything
like that they now used to go for
veterans we were supposed to be the
beautiful a lot that ran over there and
save the world from Saddam Hussein's
aggression and now you start to see some
lashing now
or sort of like a slow swelling build up
of different veterans issues coming from
from these veterans do you think that
the media support the title of your book
another necessary illusion is that the
media uses to do you think that that in
cooperation with the government who I'm
assuming is
the corporate interested in presenting
these
you think that they're now starting to
get scared that their replacement of the
Vietnam error situation which I am also
assuming they have always looked at as a
major fir and they're sad
do you think that now that they
replacing
worried that the new illusion that they
put in place is gonna backfire on them
everybody
that the
because only
do you think this might provide a window
of opportunity for the veterans to now
bring their concerns and their issues to
the fore
but if the older Vietnam era veterans
needed to go
veterans that they can bring this out in
the mainstream you have them in here in
the government and that might actually
have to honor benefits for these people
and do something about it
you want to see with how hard it can be
he's the one through the metals or
through the many figure
he was just kissing hitting the bottom
now I think there's the big thing
his testifying before his committee
and he was badgering the Kissinger
[Music]
and Kissinger returns Atkins right
and the idea that dairyman take this
you just feel like the weather like the
weather band spinning around
and the last quick question I have for
EM planning a trip to Asia next year and
I'm hoping to go to today
allows the situation understated for the
last 30 years
well that's what I'm going to try and do
and what I was wondering have you and
you're obviously more attuned to a lot
of sources that I don't know I have you
heard anything I heard a rumor recently
that the Chinese in trying to get more
the hard currency from the West into
their country are about to open the
borders and relax and the standards
which they tighten up in
riots
more Western people in and do you think
they're actually going to do anything
for at least pace and some more lip
service towards the presentations of the
Dalai Lama have made about turning the
place into a world environment Park and
the future
is it strictly for mineral resources
I should go back
1930 tanker chick
the West insisted
honey
because he's actually been in in the
Dalai Lama's right nowhere in Tibetan
history were even on Chinese history
is he real not Tibet once now notice the
Tibetan Autonomous Region was ever part
of
all right but you haven't heard anything
in particular those thank you very much
professor can you talk briefly about the
re-emergence of fascism in Germany I
mean it's not just the need I look just
a couple of days ago
notice the Germany particular anger
against refugees when everybody does it
it's true in German
your stations let's thought they had a
constitutional law now that they have
open borders well they had to allow
anybody
but you know Germany's a very racist
country that's correct it's not just you
know it's just unbelievable you know
they believe in ethnic purity actually a
lot of us you know we're money different
than your one of the good things
including Japan Japan but you go you
travel through your design you know
their racism is we don't want the guy
from the next village I'm in Europe
people tend to be in the place over
there I mean I happened to be in Germany
just before the but the idea that those
30 most of the Orcas anything UniCredit
even what we call a nation-state now
look I mean until very recently people
be needing to speak the national
language I mean he's probably still true
go to parts of chairman
Switzerland still not spoiling German
area
Napoleon almost unified Europe Cossacks
it's funny it's interesting you know
your 35 countries
well you know it's funny that you
mentioned that question we're going to
retail store in Boston and right now
because the Deutschmark is so strong
there are a lot of German tourists
coming into Boston and so seeing all the
scenes on TV about the skinheads and the
neo-nazi fascists and what they're doing
to the immigrants in Germany have been
asking these people you know what's
going on in your country what's
happening they seem to be downplaying it
now I don't know if it's a sense of
denial or if it's a sense of our media
control trying to hype it up for
whatever reason that I read in the
Boston Globe
I mean you know you can live very close
to something physically and the German
tourists are coming here are not the one
Jewish
those are the guys down the street
professor can you compare that situation
to the Republican Party's platform yeah
the the type of fascism you see in both
situations I mean this you know the way
that they are turning to what they call
cultural issues
[Music]
these are not that great you know you
read the kind of stuff that's coming out
about liberals
homosexuals and that's and I think the
mechanism is the same I mean it's a way
of trying to and you want to mobilize
they make them feel the big thank you
for the US the u.s. the infirmary fourth
wash essentially cancel the embargo
three days later a patient urged on and
Howard French and he said something like
this he said as long as there's no
opposition to policies
you were mentioning something about the
joiner center yeah
are even working on medical military
issues the present problem
Guiding maxim of fact it was the
favorite favorite saying of John J the
president of the Constitutional
Convention that those who own the
country ought to government and that's
the way it was supposed to be and when
rebellious farmers around Massachusetts
didn't understand that they had it
driven into their heads by force and
that's the way the society was
established that's the way the legal
system was established and it's the way
it's been run ever since those who own
the country are supposed to govern it
and if they do and the general public is
quiet and passive it's a democracy in
the doctrinally correct since the public
often gets out of hand and when the
public gets out of hand and tries to
enter the arena of public affairs
there's a name for that - it's called a
crisis of democracy which has to be
overcome that was the title of if you
want to really understand the United
States probably the most one of the most
important books one could read in my
opinion is a book called the crisis of
democracy published in 1975 and when
people started reading it quickly pulled
out of circulation but then it sort of
sneaked back in it was published by the
Trilateral Commission that's their only
major publication it was the Trilateral
Commission is a is sort of the liberal
side of the International ruling class
you know it's the people around Jimmy
Carter in fact he came out of there
Clinton - I think it's the sort of you
know the liberal wing of the
International elites business academic
and so on
trilateral because it involves Europe
Japan in the United States in the early
70s they were particularly concerned
over the crisis that had arisen in the
1960s namely that large sectors of the
population who are usually apathetic and
marginal and you know watching the Super
Bowl or something we're becoming
involved in public affairs we're trying
to enter the political arena to press
their demands and become organized and
so on now in the dictionary sense of the
word that's democracy but in the PC
sense
it's a crisis democracy which has to be
overcome and the you know the scholars
and others and American was a professor
from Harvard who wrote the statement
they describe how it's necessary to
overcome this crisis to restore the
public to apathy and passivity and as
the professor of government at Harvard
put it to go back to the days when
Truman was able to run the country with
the aid of a few Wall Street lawyers and
financiers that was the good old days
before the crisis erupted and we have to
somehow go back to that and in fact it's
been a major ideological offensive for
the past 20 years to try to overcome
this crisis and to try to restore the
proper state of things now it all makes
perfect sense we can be an inspiration
for democracy and we can be concerned
about the crisis of democracy when the
public starts getting involved in public
affairs all makes sense as long as you
just keep the wording straight and
remember that everything's got a there's
a new speak version and there's an
English version then you just have to
separate them out it's a little tricky
sometime but if you think it through it
works fine actually the example that I
quoted from the New Republic illustrates
this quite dramatically that statement
about the inspiration you know for
democracy in our time came in a an
article exalting over the outcome of the
February 1990 elections in Nicaragua
which happened to illustrate very
clearly exactly how democracy is
understood by across the spectrum of
educated opinion in the United States
there's a liberal conservative
difference but it falls
[Applause]
this is my directions as to how to get
here I'll spare you then it may seem a
bit odd or even maybe perverse to use
the title deterring democracy for a
discussion of US policies at home and
abroad we are after all it's supposed to
be basking in Pride over having served
as an inspiration for the triumph of
democracy and erekt I'm quoting an
editorial in the New Republic given that
how can it be suggested that the United
States actually has a dedicated and
persistent commitment to undermine and
deter democracy throughout the world not
least at home actually there's no
conflict between those two propositions
they're both true it's true on the one
hand that we're an inspiration for the
triumph of democracy in our time and
it's also true that the US has been
dedicated to preventing and undermining
democracy in order to reconcile the
apparent conflict you just have to bear
in mind something important and common
knowledge about reading anything
concerning Affairs that matter the terms
of political discourse including
democracy typically have two meanings on
the one hand there's the dictionary
meaning on the other hand there's what
we might call the PC meaning now using
the term in its accurate sense the
meaning the doctrinally correct meaning
good meeting that's used for purposes of
ideological warfare and those two
meanings are often diametrically opposed
so in the case of democracy there are
two meanings in the dictionary sense of
the word a society is democratic insofar
as the general public has the
possibility of participating in some
meaningful fashion in management of
public affairs a lot of dimensions of
that and insofar as that true of the
societies Democratic in the doctrinally
correct sense society is democratic
insofar as it's under the firm control
of business interests linked to us power
and that applies at home as well and the
general public is marginalized now
separating out those two meanings it's
perfectly possible to be an inspiration
for the triumph of democracy in the
world and the doctrinally correct sense
and to be opposed systematically to
democracy at home and abroad in the
dictionary sense of the word and in fact
I think that's exactly what we find
there is a there there's an ideological
system which describes us as the
Democratic ourselves leading democratic
country fighting for democracy
everywhere and there is also a truth
that we're opposing democracy at home
and abroad both are true just in
different senses of democracy actually
the term United States also has two
meanings and they have to be separated
on the one hand the United States can
stand for the people who live in this
geographical area on the other hand that
can refer to the rulers the people who
feel entitled to and do in fact manage
and control the society and those are
just two different groups and it's been
that way ever since the origins of the
Republic it's been founded on that basis
it's well to remember they gather on
important issues like this one and it's
worth having a look at it closely
because it does illustrate what is meant
by democracy and what you know what the
sense in which we try to inspire we mean
in this sense you know the rulers try to
inspire and create democracy actually
it's worth going back a couple of months
to November 1989 it was an interesting
date because that was the date when the
Berlin Wall fell and after that time
unless you're really pretty crazed you
couldn't believe that the Russians are
coming so any pretense
the bad things we do are in reaction to
the Russian threat could no longer be
upheld I mean I could never be a build
but certainly after February after
November 1989 I was hopeless
everybody except real fanatics you know
had maybe there's some people around
they still think they're you know kind
of trying to mislead us and they're
really gonna come back at our throats
but people who are moderately saying
abandoned the idea that the Cold War was
known at that time so for it's very
interesting then to look at events since
November 1989 to see just how much has
changed if you look you see nothing's
changed which tells you exactly what the
Cold War was but that's a different
topic in any event on this topic on
democracy November 1989 was interesting
there were November 18 1989 there were
in fact elections in Honduras which had
been under US control at that point for
ten years and the elections were
described by George Bush as an inspiring
example of the democratic promise that
today is spreading throughout the
Americas
so we inspire the world in Honduras kind
of little country so they only inspire
the Americas and in fact there was an
election there were was there were two
candidates one of them represented large
landowners the other represented big
industrialists they had the identical
programs therefore there was no there
was a there was a campaign but it was
just insults and entertainment it's kind
of not unlike one that appeared to the
north a few months earlier the the
effective rulers of the military and who
are under US control the during the
period right up to the election the
there's a regular low-level of human
rights abuses you know of killings and
so on and so forth it's not like El
Salvador Guatemala it's just kind of low
level and that escalated a bit before
the election so yeah Union leaders
killed and left by the roadside and that
sort of thing the starvation and misery
are
rampant and increasing they'd increased
considerably during the decade of
democracy as its called
along with capital flight and huge debt
and and so on it's extraordinarily for
our country but profits are flowing
there's no real threat to order the
level of state terror is low enough so
you don't forget to exercised about it
you know some torture some killing but
not massive so therefore it's an
inspiring example of democracy then
we're all happy about it we've brought
democracy to Honduras and we can be
inspired November 1989 the same month
was the opening of the electoral
campaign in Nicaragua Nicaragua had in
fact had elections in 1984 but those
elections were not an inspiring example
of democracy the reason is that they
couldn't be controlled and therefore
they don't qualify it's therefore been
necessary to write them out of history
and in fact they are out of history in
the United States oh you're not allowed
to mention them the press can't mention
it was necessary to suppress completely
the fact that the Latin American Studies
Association the professional association
of Latin American scholars had a detail
how to vary the closest this got
analysis of an election on the spot that
they'd ever had and you know I thought
it was quite good and so on same was
true of hostile observer has very widely
observed the Dutch government sent a
very hostile official delegation which
reluctantly conceded that the elections
were fine and the Irish parliament had a
right-wing delegation which drew the
same conclusion as the British
Parliament had the same and so on all
this had to be X naught of this can be
mentioned the press ever could there
never were elections that's a Dogma in
PCE usage there were no elections but
they were going to have them in 1990
this time the US was taking no chances
as the electoral campaign opened in
November 1989 Violeta Chamorro the US
and that was brought to Washington for
photo opportunities in the White House
issued a statement saying that the US
embargo which was strangling the country
would be maintained unless the u.s.
candidate won so Nicaraguans are told
vote for our person or what's your
children's star next Congress and the
White House jointly continued the
support for the terrorist forces that
the US was running from Honduras they
called it humanitarian aid that was a
lie that had already been determined by
the World Court which determined
officially and again that's something
you can't cite here that it was not
humanitarian aid it was military aid the
White House Congress decision to
continue it and to maintain the level of
terror was in violation of the decision
of Central American presidents the
decision of the world Court the UN which
is irrelevant because the u.s. just
vetoed every resolution that came along
and that was the next step and the media
continued as they had in the past to
suppress all of this I mean you really
have to be an addict to figure it out
it's there you know if you look
carefully but nobody would know the
Nicaraguans were essentially informed
that only a vote for the u.s. candidate
could end the terror and in the economic
strangulation and in fact there which
was of course both illegal both in fact
condemned by the world court that was
the condition for the election so the
plane the playing field was level as we
put it and there was an election and it
was kind of interesting to look at the
reactions to it north and south of the
Rio Grande actually written article data
but south of the Rio Grande through
Latin America it was described simply as
a victory for George Bush a lot it by
the right wing in Saddam the press is
mostly right-wing because any other
press has been murdered or destroyed and
they liked the outcome but it was simply
flatly described as a victory for George
Bush not as an election which is exactly
the way we would have described that if
something
similar taken place a in Lithuania under
you know Russian and terrorist attack or
something in the United States on the
other hand it was uniformly described as
the way the New York Times put it in a
headline victory for us fair play in
fact the big us article the New York
Times article was called Americans
United enjoy over the victory for us
fair play actually that phrase itself is
interesting there are countries where
you find things like you know United
enjoy like maybe Albania
you know North Korea you could imagine
Albanians United enjoy over something or
other countries were a totalitarian
cultures and floors
so it was Americans United enjoy over
victory for us fair play and it's not
that people were unaware of how the
victory was achieved
they were pretty frank about it in fact
so here's Time magazine Time magazine
described I'm quoting the means that
were employed to bring about what they
called the latest the the latest in the
happy series of democratic surprises as
democracy burst forth in Nicaragua and
the method was to wreck the economy and
prosecute a long and deadly proxy war
until the exhaustive natives overthrow
the unwanted government themselves at a
cost to us that is minimal leaving
victim leaving the victim with wreck
bridges sabotage power stations and
ruined farms and thus providing the u.s.
candidate with a winning issue ending
the impoverishment of the people of
Nicaragua okay that's the way we did it
so it's a victory for us fair play and
Americans are united enjoy
well that frankness is kind of
refreshing I mean you might find
something similar in Nazi Germany here
maybe Stalinist Russia possibly I'm not
sure but it tells you exactly what is
meant by the Americans United United and
joy over the victory for democracy
that's what they mean by democracy
democracy is where you you make it very
clear by murder
in terror an economic strangulation that
you vote for us or else and then if it
works it's democracy okay there we have
democracy and the politically correct
sense and in that sense as you know I'm
not making it up you're I'm reading from
the mainstream in fact even the liberal
side of the mainstream you have an
explanation of what democracy amounts to
actually some similar stories going on
right now and it's going to be replayed
in what's today the 24th and a couple of
days in Angola
you know it's a it's a repetition of the
Nicaragua story but even uglier there
the number of people who've been
murdered is not 30 or 40,000 but
probably half a million or so and the
country has been totally devastated from
1975 the country has been under attack
first by by South Africa and by the
us-run terrorist forces who need to
attacking the country first from Namibia
as long as it was possible to hang on to
that and then switched over to say here
another us kind of colony the United
States is almost alone in the world in
refusing to recognize the Angolan
government since 1975 the South African
forces continued to attack until 1990
they were they for the suffer defeat by
the Cuban forces that were there to
defend the country against South African
aggression which is considered a
absolute atrocity in the United States
that there were Cubans there trying to
stop South African aggression the after
that South Africa withdrew and there was
an agreement a p6o peace agreement in
May 1991 which called for elections that
you're supposed to come off a few days
29th and 30th of September exactly as in
Central America exactly as in Central
America after the peace agreements the
u.s. moved it once to subvert it it
subvert them it continued to offer
support to the unit forces who are who
are vicious terrorists I mean
not much doubt about that they take
credit for shooting down civilian
airliners torture or all sorts of things
