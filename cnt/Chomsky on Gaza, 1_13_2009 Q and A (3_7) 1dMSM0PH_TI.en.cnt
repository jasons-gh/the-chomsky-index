professor Chomsky you've almost entirely
glossed over the numerous war crimes and
violations of international law which
have committed by Hamas the ruling party
in Gaza these include this targeting of
civilian populations by sending
thousands of rockets into southern
Israel and Hamas is well documented use
of human shields by doing things like
hiding their armaments in preschools
ambulances and hospitals I was wondering
if you had a response to these crimes
yeah well actually I did talk about the
first as I pointed out Israel's from
haces targeting of Israeli civilian
targets yeah that's there's a criminal
acts as well as politically stupid but
and therefore I think it would make good
sense for us to stop our enormous
military diplomatic an ideological
support for Hamas okay that's what we
can do about it of course these crimes
like Hershel Greene spawns or like those
of the partisans during the Second World
War it didn't come out of nowhere these
are a reaction to ongoing Israeli crimes
norway in gaza but extensively in the
west bank and those who have another
proposal as to what come on so does what
resistance ought to take do have a moral
ground to moral grounds to criticize
those actions okay just as those in
germany who were calling for an end to
Nazi aggression you know they couldn't
because they did killed but we're free
to do it here would have had a
justification in condemning the
terrorism of the partisans they didn't
have a justification for supporting the
Gestapo slogan a terror against terror
you commit there will commit worst
terror the only people in Germany who
had a right to criticize the terror that
they were attacking were those who were
trying to stop the far greater
atrocities of the Nazis same with
cristal not same with many other cases
the same with the American Revolution
I'm in the American you know the
Patriots as we call them work
carrot we're terrorist forces Karen I
mean those days terrorism wasn't as
Extreme as it is today nor was military
conflict but yeah I was serious I mean
that's why the number of people who fled
the colonies after independence was
higher or approximately the same as the
proportion of the population that fled
Vietnam after after the u.s. withdrew
they fled the terror of the of the
victors I mean there were people fleeing
from Boston Harbor rating pathetic
letters about how they were dying in the
snow and Nova Scotia because they just
had to get away from these terrorists
who won the war this is not a major
theme of American history but you can
find the facts if you like and they had
good reason to because yes nathanael
greens forces for example we're straight
terrorist forces and of course the
British objected to this how dare they
hide you know in civilian places to
shoot at our soldiers as for the well
documented facts that you mentioned the
documentation is zero the sole sole
source for those claims is Israeli Armed
Israeli propaganda maybe it's true maybe
it isn't there it's hard to imagine
where you could hide in Gaza or live in
Gaza except near civilian target Israel
of course does it all the time so if you
ask where the Israeli military command
is that's right in the middle of the
cities where they going to put it so
sure this even though the documentation
happens to be zero not well documented
nevertheless it's almost certainly true
and it offers no justification
whatsoever for destroying the
university's destroying the school's
mental health clinics attacking
hospitals shooting at ambulances all the
other crimes that you can read about if
you want to bother looking and the
crimes are really serious so
brought with me a report which I have
not seen reported in the American press
from the super find it from the Gaza
water utility this is January 10th the
press release they described won't
bother reading it but they essentially
describe how hundreds of thousands of
people in Gaza or without water because
of Israeli attacks on water systems and
also attacks on sewage systems and in
fact power plants which make everything
run so that one discharging pond is
leading to a major catastrophe that
threatens the lives of thousands of
people just by drowning and sewage
flooding well okay sure some Israeli
propagandist can tell you yeah there was
a mortar hidden in the sewage system
maybe there was does that have anything
to do with these atrocities nothing you
know for very simple reasons the ones I
mentioned there is a right to resort to
violence in self-defense if there are no
alternatives and in this case there are
very clear alternatives stop the
criminal activities and accept the peace
treaty okay not very hard stop your
crimes metal end the the rocketing that
you're concerned with
