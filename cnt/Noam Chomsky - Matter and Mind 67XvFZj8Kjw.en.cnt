all right let's go back at the
traditional dualism and say take the
Cartesian form traditional Cartesian
metaphysical dualism and remember the
way it worked in outline Descartes
argued sort of as follows
he had a conception of the physical
world he gave a conception of physics
the conception of physics is what was
called in those days the mechanical
philosophy philosophy is just a word for
science so philosophy means science so
the mechanical philosophy meant McEntee
mechanics and mechanics was kind of a
common-sense mechanics it was a sort of
contact mechanics things can influence
one another if they're in contact that's
the crucial idea like I can't move the
moon by moving my arm let's fake as
they're not in contact that's just
common sense happens to be wrong but
it's common sense okay so that's common
sense contact mechanics and Descartes
gave a kind of you know sketchy account
I mean not a detailed account but a sort
of sketchy account of how you might
cover all of the phenomena he claimed of
the inorganic world the organic world
most of things about humans
everything except these few things that
I mentioned in terms of the mechanical
philosophy in terms of a kind of contact
mechanics well all of that's and then he
said look there's these phenomena that
are around like the creative aspect of
language use which don't fall under this
therefore we need a new principle
completely rational
we need a new principle they're not
covered by the mechanical philosophy
within his framework the only way to set
up the new principle was entertained as
a new substance but that's part of the
framework which he approached it so you
introduced race coconuts
another principle thinking substance
which has other properties and then from
a naturalistic point of view you have
two questions first of all what's its
character what is it you know what is
the race go get tons
nobody actually knows whether they cart
had an answer to this if you look at his
major book he excited to do moment you
know this big study of the world there's
only three volumes there was a fourth
volume which was supposedly devoted to
the mind and legend has it that he
destroyed that volume after he heard
what happened to Galileo whether that's
true or not I don't know maybe all the
secrets are in there like Fairmont's
Last Theorem or something but in any
event there's nothing much around from
the theory of mine but that would have
been the problem one problem would have
been okay if you've got this separate
substance tell us what it is you know
the second problem would be the standard
unification problem arises in the
sciences altogether that is show how
this theory relates to other theories
now in the terminology to that day it
meant solved interaction problem show
how minds and body interact no that's a
the way in which the standard
unification problem of normal science is
stated in terms of a to substance theory
of the structure of science and remember
a to substance eery of science is
perfectly rational and may be completely
wrong again but most theories have
always been wrong there's nothing
irrational about it and we can I think
without doing serious violence to in
fact maybe even providing some
understanding to the history rethink it
in this form so we have a naturalistic
approach which claims to show that whole
range and phenomena of the world fall
under contact mechanics so identify some
phenomena don't fall into it invokes new
principle then should precede study that
new principle developing a theory of
mind which would be like a theory of
chemistry or jeans or something and then
show the salt unification problem show
how it falls in with other parts of the
theory of the world it looks as if it's
what the heart was trying to do in
principles of philosophy and quite a
Timon don't know all that's worth stuff
inside these are the parts of the
Descartes that nobody ever reads the
parts of Descartes that people read are
things like discourse on method which
was like a research
and proposal I mean it wasn't serious he
was saying look support me I want to
work on this topic or the meditations
where he's trying to answer questions
that philosophers raised that all this
but from de cartes point of view but I
mean as much as he can reconstruct it
seems that what was important was the
science you know dioptres things like
that and the other stuff was thinking
about the nature of science well since
the science is mostly in fact almost all
maybe all outmoded you know you don't
study it but for that matter nobody much
studies Cal Alejo either because it's
done differently and better but that
doesn't mean that it wasn't important to
you
you know what remains is to talk about
the science and since there's been no
progress on that at all
you can make perfectly perfectly
perfectly good sense to read say
discourse on method but I think one
should read it recognize from that for
Descartes this is peripheral it's not
central if you want to understand the
project you have to look at it his way
when you reconstructed his way I think
you find a very naturalistic project
which ends up with metaphysical dualism
as a serious proposal serious proposal
about the nature of the world which
could very well turn out to be right
like other serious proposals about the
nature of the world well so again this
is dualism but it's not non-naturalistic
it's naturalistic dualism may be wrong
but naturalistic within this period of
science well all of this has been
ridiculed especially in the modern
period as the idea that there's as over
I'll put it a ghost in the machine and
then you're supposed to laugh there's a
ghost in the machine isn't that silly
but that mistakes the problem completely
it's true that cartesian metaphysical
dualism didn't outlast the century but
it was not because of problems with the
ghost the theory of mine such as it was
was untouched what Newton exercised was
the machine not the ghost
in fact what Newton showed is contrary
to everyone's expectations including
is you had a ghost all the way down that
is even ordinary matter and the most
elementary dynamics had ghostly
properties wasn't just mine
everything is go to sleep so no Newton
showed that contact mechanics amazingly
just didn't work it was true that you
could influence things at a distance now
Newton but scientists of the day
including the incidentally thought that
this was absurd Newton himself called
universal gravitation and occult
property he said anyone with any brains
at all can see that it's inconceivable
that something can influence something
that it's not in direct contact with yet
we seem to have to assume a little not
from his pointed I'm in some kind of
majors scientist is a people XP Cloyd
and some others just threw it out for
this reason because it was idiotic
Newton was himself torn by it you know
he realized it's just got to be right
because it was such a spectacular
breakthrough on the other hand it made
absolutely no sense because it was
inconsistent with the mechanical
philosophy and what in fact happened is
he didn't get rid of the ghost in the
machine but he just showed that all of
all properties of matter are ghostly
it's all at first it's all
unintelligible all the way down in
terrestrial motion and planetary motion
which is a big problem and remains a big
problem and it led to a new it led to a
totally new way of looking at science
this is same and I made it out
repeatedly and Bernard Cohen who's maybe
the major Newton scholar points out just
quote his version of he said by by
entering into this paradoxical world
he said Newton set forth a new view of
science in which the goal is to find the
best theoretical explanation
irrespective of any intuitive notion
they have of ultimate explanation so the
point is there is a ghost in the machine
and that's just the way the machines are
there ghostly can't do anything about it
the mechanical philosophy appears to be
wrong although it's self-evidently true
it just seems to be wrong from this
night on we must find his quote we must
be satisfied with universal gravitation
let's call it Yugi short come back to
that we must be satisfied with Yugi and
that it exists even if we cannot explain
it in terms of the self-evident
mechanical philosophy that's just where
we are science means accepting Yugi if
you have evidence for it and it is it
provides you with an intelligible
scientific theory even if there's no way
of accounting for it in terms of what
self-evident namely the mechanical
philosophy which you just have to admit
is wrong even though it's self-evidently
true at the from this point on people's
intuition about what must be true come
here relevant it's become irrelevant so
if the way to deal with universal
gravitation is through curved space-time
okay that's the way to deal with
universes through weird quantum
mechanical effects too bad for intuition
if the world really has it's made up of
you know infinite one-dimensional
strings and dimensional space okay kind
of stuck with that time has a beginning
on time as a beginning whatever we're
gonna take idea people come up with
tomorrow it has to be evaluated in terms
of merits does it yield the insight and
understand does it help us come to terms
with the nature of the world if it does
it satisfies conditions for rational
inquiry irrespective of our intuitions
the Newtonian revolution and even
earlier the Galilean revolution I think
that's essential content now it's kind
of general content
sort of that from then on you're off in
a totally new path that's why it's
really the one real scientific
revolution in human history
it just said inquiry often and entirely
yeah and that's where we are we have no
other criteria common-sense criteria are
irrelevant now we can't get out of our
skin I mean you go out in the evening
and you see the sunset and no matter
what you know you still see the sunset
and when you see the moon near the
horizon it's just bigger than when you
see it up there
you can't not see the moon illusion so
we see the world in terms of the way we
are you know can't help it
just like he intuitively feel that the
mechanical philosophy must be true
because how could it not be but we have
learned we have come to recognize that
the way we see the world is just another
fact to be explained to that world so if
we see the sunset and we see the moon
illusion and we believe in the
mechanical philosophy no matter how much
we try not to that's just a fact about
the world in fact it's a fact about a
very special part of the world namely
the human mind brain and the way in
which it acts and conceptualizes and
constructs and so on and we'd like to
come to understand that and in order to
do it we have to make a convenient
electrical wrench we have to take
ourselves out of our skins and look back
at ourselves kind of reflexively as part
of the world and that's hard but you
know that's what it means to take a to
studying human beings naturalistically
so that's the move one has to make to
study human beings naturalistically and
then the way we look at things in common
sense no longer provides a criterion for
intelligible explanation but rather is
just a phenomenon to be explained not
there's a real problem here which you
can see right off whatever the right you
know that the working ocean of
intelligible explanation is again
something that's inside our skins and
we're stuck with it
that that's a ooh that's something like
a real paradox we can only whatever our
capacities to carry out rational inquiry
maybe say some corner of our brain which
let's just call it science forming
faculty to dignify the ignorance for the
title but there's some part of our brain
that enables us to carry out rational
inquiry and it uses its own resources
and its own criteria which may be as
misleading as the movement illusion no
maybe it's always systematically leading
us away from the nature of the world if
open creatures of the world that would
not get lead in the least surprising but
there we can't do anything about it
because we're stuck with those that's as
deep as you can go can't go beyond those
so if we're systematically misled about
the world because of the way our science
performing faculty happens to be
constructed that we can't do much about
but we can overcome the moon illusion
hard but we can overcome it we can't
stop seeing it you can't stop seeing
this Sun setting you can't stop leaving
in a mechanical philosophy and Newton's
intuitions are least my intuitions
uh-huh but that part you can throw out
the the part that's guiding our search
for intelligible theory we can't throw
out there's no way to get out of that
then there you are approaching something
which is kind of like classical paradox
maybe but we have to recognize from the
naturalistic point of view that we are
just a particular organism trying to
understand the world and we've got to do
it our way because there is no other
possibility well with so so anyway the
getting passed through metaphysical
Google is we've now abandoned
metaphysical dualism but abandoned it in
a very special way it's not that there's
a ghost in the machine it's that the
machine has ghostly properties all the
way you know maybe it has even more
goodness leap properties above the neck
if so okay but that's just another fact
however it's already unintelligible to
common sense down to elementary dynamics
that's been newton's basic discovery
that's why contemporary discussion
ridiculing the ghost and the machine is
completely off track in my opinion it's
just miss point of what happened there
was no criticism made of the Cartesian
theory of mind
you could argue that's because it wasn't
substantive enough maybe but in any
event it survived all of this intact
such as it was what did not survive is
the theory of the machine contact
mechanics was thrown out and the common
sense of the next scientific generation
is that the mechanical philosophy is
wrong actually took a long time for this
to settle in you know for a couple
hundred years in physics people were
trying to find mechanical explanations
and it really wasn't until probably the
20th century that that was given up you
get as late as people like punk RA he
was arguing that the molecular theory of
gases we adopt only because as a
computing mechanism and the only reason
we adopt it is because we're familiar
with game of billiards so it's kind of
convenient computing mechanism and
efforts to try to explain things in
terms of you know ether and stuff like
that are an attempt to carry out
mechanical philosophy and it was a long
time before it's really this this
century before Newton's insight was
basically incorporated into these
sciences and it harder maybe even to do
it in the emerging Sciences but anyhow I
think in retrospect that's the way we
have to look at it well if this is
correct then one so I'm being kind of
anachronistic when I say that the 17th
century exercised mechanical philosophy
it did in principle it didn't get
through it in fact it left the pig
residue of unhappiness confusion that
took centuries to sort out but looking
back it seems fair to say you know I
have distracted me speaking the Newton
exercise machine you got rid of the
mechanical philosophy but note it's an
anachronism just hit that way but I
think
an accurate historical reconstruction
and I'll continue with historical
reconstruction
well one consequence of eliminating the
machine is that we've gotten rid of any
notion of body or physical or material
there no longer is any notion of the
material world remembered Descartes
could be a duelist because he had a
notion of body body not a very clear
notion but at least a general notion
body is defined by the mechanical
philosophy but like contact mechanics
that's body ok now Newton showed that's
not the way body works so therefore we
have no conception of body in fact it's
just a world whatever it is you know if
the world has mental properties that's
part of the world but there is no notion
of body unless somebody comes up with a
new notion and nobody's ever done that
unless somebody comes up with a new
notion of the physical talk about
physicalism or materialism or a limit of
materialism or the mind-body problem so
it just seems to be meaningless not if
this is correct something very curious
has happened because people are talking
about it all the time there's all kind
of stuff right up to the present about
the mind-body problem and there are
theories in the cognitive sciences say
the church one's called eliminative
materialism which says we shouldn't
study the mind we should just study the
material world and there's a lot of
questions about physicalist reductionism
can we reduce things to physical terms
in fact you know this is just this is
universal plus in these areas but I I
don't understand it maybe nobody can
explain it it seems but once we have
lost the notion of physical none of this
discussion is even meaningful doesn't
mean anything you can't have a problem
of reducing things to the material if
there's no notion of material and there
is no notion of material what what is it
I mean somebody could say well that's
what they teach other in the physics
department but the people in the physics
department that's not true
because they expect two years from now
to be teaching something else you know
at least if the subject still alive so
that can't be true and there is no other
notion all we have is the world with
whatever properties it has there's a
notion of material world or physical
world hence all of the problems of
reduction have disappeared the problems
of elimination of study the mind in
favor of neurophysiology or something
don't mean anything
they're just surely a rational statement
saying instead of studying this part of
the world that study that part of the
world if you want to but it doesn't make
any more sense than saying us in solids
are hard to study let's study liquids
maybe okay but that's it's of no more
interest than that unless somebody can
come along with theory with the concept
of the material to replace the Cartesian
concept which has been thrown out the
window as far as I know nobody has even
addressed that problem let alone offered
an answer to it and if so again let me
try to put it in the strongest terms
virtually all the discussion in the
field is not just wrong but meaningless
literally without meaning it's talking
about a problem that's unsustainable no
that's a strongest version of the
position I'm trying to take so let me
put it in the most outrageous form
possible the whole field is not wrong
but meaningless talking about something
that it can't characterize namely
something that presupposes a notion of
physical which has been abandoned since
the 17th century
that's strongest version of this
particular thesis well with metaphysical
dualism now unstable because we don't
have any body any more notions like a
limited materialism and so on lose sense
and the kind of natural conclusion to
draw from Newton's demolition of the
theory of matter
and that's what it was is to that the
natural conclusion is to say that human
thought and action say creative s
because language use are just properties
of organised matter but that's all there
is you know there's nothing else so
they're just properties of organized
matter and in fact that conclusion was
drawn sporadically but not too long
after it was drawn first by lemma II
then it was about a century later I'm a
half-century later man it was considered
totally outrageous
in fact his work hasn't been revived
until his century a limit he was driven
out he was dr. he was driven he said his
argument was looking for must be just a
property of organized matter because
there isn't anything else he was driven
out of France gonna out of Holland the
finally survived thanks to the
protection of Frederick the Great for
some reason about a generation later in
more tolerant England the same idea was
developed by the eminent chemist Joseph
Priestley a major 8th century scientist
who argued that find is quote he argued
them quoting him now that thought in
humans is a property of the brain it's
necessary result of a certain
organization it's like electricity
magnetism and the powers of attraction
and repulsion that's what we compared it
to nobody really understood those things
but whatever electricity magnetism and
the powers of attraction repulsion are
these ghostly properties that matter has
thought is just another one of them
there's other one of those ghostly
properties and we have to investigate it
in these terms
another 18th century version is that the
brain secretes thought the way the liver
secretes bile you know that's kind of
the image if you look at people like
John Searle today seems to be saying
something more or less similar to that
if they understand him correctly well
that looks like the right move mainly
because there's no other choice
there doesn't seem to be any other move
you could
I mean since all there is it's a world
which has mostly properties all the way
down to elementary dynamics there's
nothing to say except that properties of
Attraction propulsion and the
electricity and magnetism and later on
quantum effects and thought and whatever
else is around anything that's going on
it's just some properties world some
property of the way matter is organized
or where matter now has no meaning it's
just whatever there is some property of
whatever of how whatever there is it's
organized has these features and a
naturalistic approach the humans would
thought to proceed that way well that
leads us to the next question
how can organized matter have these
properties well on that question
progress has been essentially zero we
don't know any Rehab any we have nothing
to say about how organized matter can
have such properties as the creative
aspect of language use in that respect
for exactly as much in the dark as the
Cartesians work it's not that matter in
mind our different kinds of things that
can't be because there doesn't seem to
be any such kind of thing as matter so
their matter in mind can't be different
kinds of things there being no matter so
they're not different kinds of things
but if we think of those terms as
descriptive conveniences describing
certain aspects of the world you know
namely humans above the neck versus
everything else then it seems that
matter in mine pose different kinds of
problems the human intelligence that
appears to be the case maybe they'll be
trying to be wrong like there was a time
when electricity and magnetism and for
that matter universal gravitation also
posed total mysteries maybe we just
haven't learned enough but for now you
know it seems reasonable to suppose that
matter in mind are not different kind of
things to oppose different kind of
problems to human intelligence
