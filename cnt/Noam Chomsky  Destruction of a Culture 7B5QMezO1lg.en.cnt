as powerful could be the same and in
fact the chances of recovery of a
culture are let me give it one example
from right here in this area here when
the colonists British colonists came the
one of the major one of the biggest
drives major languages that was the
whompin up about a hundred years ago
they were gone
I'm there's some remnants around the
language was gone
now there's the first native speaker of
Wampanoag in a hundred years was a
six-year-old girl what happened is that
great linguist here can Hale died
recently people who created us
Australian Aboriginal linguistics worked
on land rights and things but he and
young woman from the drive Jenny little
doe were able to reconstruct the
language which hadn't been spoken for a
hundred years
she thought her her daughter had a baby
and the baby grew up speaking well for
non first native speaker in hundred
years to revitalize the drive they're
still around
no revitalize the drive but that's
looked like total destruction can't get
worse than that but it's reviving and
there are cases that are true if you go
to say California they're probably a
thousand languages they're almost all
gone but it's true in Europe too it
takes eight Italy you know there are
plenty of people in Italy who can't talk
to their grandmothers because they took
at the language which is being destroyed
one of the things that happens with so
cold
in Greece civilization but it doesn't
have to happen there's revival to this
case that I mentioned is the most
extreme that I know if it's not the only
one that takes a Basque Basque was okay
it was banned but under the fascist
regime and it was spoken by you know
people's grandmothers up in the hills
it's now the national language take
Wales you walk around the streets of
Cardiff listen to children coming out of
school they're talking well it's revived
this there's lots of possibilities so I
you know not what we'd like it to be
maybe
