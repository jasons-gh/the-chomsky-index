this is Carl daily we're visiting with
noam chomsky philosopher author what
else mr. Chomsky annoyance annoyance
okay annoyance the phone numbers are 2
22 kk ey and 693 ke ke y stay with us
we'll be right back okay let's take some
phone calls originally good afternoon
dusty this is karl dean and you're
talking to Noam Chomsky oh thank you so
much it's such a pleasure to be able to
speak you betcha Chomsky I'm familiar
with your articles in the link and also
your articles have been reprinted in our
local newspaper The Vancouver Colombian
quite happy about that I have two
questions a mental let someone else get
on the part do you foresee a more
even-handed approach to the
israeli-palestinian problem from the
Bush administration then was faring in
the Reagan administration and can you
give me the names of a couple of
senators that we could write to 2 in
support of the Palestinians well on the
second question I think you should
pressure your own I don't know where you
come from but your own representatives
you gotta be kidding well I think that's
the only way to do it because they're
the only ones who are responsive they
respond to some extent to their own
constituencies but for example if i was
to write a letter to the senator from
Oregon II probably throw it in the
wastebasket I don't work for that's what
would happen if we write well I'm not so
sure that I mean I would say mark
Hatfield for example well be responsive
if not my editor okay washing your in
Washington I say just laid Gordon okay
yeah well it's different yeah the butt
so then I try mine you know the house
representatives who they might be and I
think you know that don't forget that no
matter who the senator is and who the
representative is they care about public
pressures if only because they want
their own population to be quiet and
apathetic so one of the ways in which
you can affect the policy is just by
being disruptive and annoying are you
that you are labeled communist by the
sum of the supporters of the lagoon
party in Israel you wouldn't believe the
things I've been labeled I could they go
across the board from Nazi to communist
who I've even been accused by the
LaRouche organization of organized of
running the international terrorist
network I mean I've been accused of all
kind of things that sort of comes with a
turf but lots of compliments coming over
yeah but the I you know I I mean I feel
responsible for what I say not for you
know the mud that people throw us but I
think your first question is more
important I mean what are the chances
for a change in bush administration
policy here i think the crucial question
remember that people in power this is
true in the United States and it's true
in any other country people in power
basically understand only one thing
violence on the success of violence now
as long as Israel was able to control
and repress the population in the
occupied territories the United States
was quite happy but that's true of
Democrats and Republicans as long as
Israel had things under control and
could serve as what's called the
strategic asset they didn't care very
much what was going on in the occupied
territories but in the last year Israel
has discovered that it hurting a lot of
trouble controlling the occupied
territories what has happened last year
is a very impressive thing I'm in the
the Intifada this uprising from a just a
human point of view is very impressive I
mean it's a real critical as a popular
revolution it's not we only talk about
throwing stones but the whole of Arab
society on the west bank and the the
Gaza Strip has been revitalized and
changed I mean you know the traditional
authority patterns are breaking down
there are women's groups who are
breaking out there's local local
communities are taking over their own
affairs it's a real social revolution
and it's a remarkable one also their
bravery and standing up against the
barbaric treatment is extremely
impressive so far Israel hasn't been
able to control it and it's becoming
very costly and the United States is
certainly watching that in world opinion
me not only in world yes and world
opinion but also in other respects for
example the Israeli morale of the
Israeli army is beginning to erode
notice that I told you that's very
significant I never remember what
happened to the American army in Vietnam
citizens armies are not good at
attacking civilians you want to attack
civilians you need professional killers
that's why most the imperial powers tend
to use mercenaries you know the United
States made them as technical mistake in
Vietnam we used the citizens army to try
to fight a colonial war and that doesn't
work because you can't take a kid off
the streets and turn them into a
professional killer in a year so the
American army began to collapse in your
Road and that's happening to its credit
I should say and that's beginning to
happen in Israel to and the top command
is concerned about it also it's just
costly in playing financial terms i
should say now if israel is on is
incapable of they're going to try to
control the uprising by violence and the
Washington will be watching if they do
it Democrats and Republicans and
everyone else will say that's fine they
may not say it but they'll think it an
act that way if they can't control it by
violence there'll be a shift in US
policy will adapt to that and will
adjust to it the same thing has happened
before remember ever take the relations
between Israel and Egypt it's kind of
suppressed here but the fact of the
matter which anybody can find out it for
themselves they want the fact of the
matter is that Sadat the president of
Egypt offered a full-scale peace treaty
to Israel in 1971 1971 that's six years
before he went to Jerusalem that was
turned rejected by Israel on grounds
that they did not want they recognized
it as a full-scale legitimate peace
offer but they thought it would have
required that they give up the occupied
territory they wanted to hold on to them
now in 1973 they were backed by the
United States in that in that rejection
that's sort of a source of the modern
conflict there the in 1973 Egypt
attacked Israel very avid attack Israel
it attacked the occupied territories
that attack its own territory occupied
by Israel and it was surprisingly
successful that was a big shock Israel
and to American intelligence and
expected that and they adjusted
The Adjustment was they recognized that
Egypt was a significant force and
they'll free have to deal with it and
they began to move towards what
ultimately ended up in Camp David that
is an effort to successful effort to
exclude Israel Egypt from the conflict
that eliminates the major Arab deterrent
and that meant that Israel would now be
free to move in the occupied territories
and against lebanon well that was an
adjustment to the realities of the world
and there's going to be an adjustment to
these realities god thank you very much
for the phone call dusty good afternoon
Donna you're speaking to mr. Noam
Chomsky yes mr. Chomsky uh several
months ago I heard you in saw you on
c-span program with Jeff Jeff Cohen this
was in regard to the fact that the press
wasn't really a liberal bias press but
on the other hand possibly was even the
other direction even are not necessarily
conservative I don't want to compete
servatus with people who are right
wingers but and you you both made a very
wonderful presentation and I was hoping
that you could run a little bit of that
by a nurse because we do have a lot to
complain about a liberal by of press and
I was very impressed with the program
and then I would like to ask the
question what can we do to get
mainstream press to actually be a little
bit more responsible and liberal and
unbiased and report everything all right
well I actually I have a don't be much
done talk about it but I have a recent
book that just came out with a colleague
of mine Edward Herman's called
manufacturing consent which is effect
precisely about this topic but another
one on the way but see I personally I
don't like to use the words liberal and
conservative I don't think Peyton please
I don't understand what they mean I
think we want the press to tell the
truth no I don't care whether it's the
wall street journal or the new york
times or somebody else I wanted to tell
the truth about things that are
important and I think they often don't I
think whatever they're called liberal or
conservative or something else they
reflect certain
wrists and it's not very difficult to
discover what those interests are
remember what the major media are the
major media are major corporations
they're owned by an interlinked with
even bigger conglomerates they like
other corporations they sell a product
to a market the market is advertisers
that is other businesses and the product
is lit as an audience so there are
unpack further the national media you
know the elite media it's relatively
privileged audiences that's what they
want to sell to advertisers so what you
got is an institute institution major
corporations selling privileged
audiences to other businesses and not
very surprisingly that's the point of
view of the world that they reflect they
reflect the point of view the interests
of their the sellers the buyers and the
product and whether they call themselves
liberal or conservative or anything else
that's a very biased and narrow view of
the world and I think that one should
pressure them to study other things so
for example when the United States
blocks a peace settlement in the Middle
East both the liberal and the
conservative press whatever that means a
lot to tell the truth about it when the
United States moves to try to crush
independence and social reform in
Central America by violence everyone
ought to call the truth about it whether
they're called liberal and conservative
and how do you do this well I think the
way you do it is like anything else you
bother them if delegations show up at
editorial offices and people are writing
letters and you're calling up the editor
and so on you can get a reaction the
press is not responsive to people who
never make a letter pin drop but any
institution no matter how powerful it is
is going to be responsive to public
disruption they want a quiet apathetic
public anybody with power once that and
the power that ordinary individuals have
you know short of gaining the resources
to build up your own press which is
something else but we're supporting the
listeners board radio or something that
kind the other option that you have is
to just you know may cost be disruptive
bother them tell them tell them things
approach them not I don't mean throw
stones at them
give them information say why aren't you
printing this you know here's true facts
important facts how come you're not
printing it why are you stressing that
and so on they do have professional
integrity I mean oman you know there are
some crooks but by and large the press
the people in it have professional
integrity and you can get them to
respond to well presented accurate
truths if you do it insistently enough
but it takes insistence any other
questions Donna no that's about it thank
you for the phone call good afternoon
Nina this is crawl daily you're talking
to mr. Noam Chomsky yeah hi mr. Chomsky
yes I have two questions um when James
Baker was at the confirmation hearings
he was asked if we were going to
continue to back the persons of our
choice you know with money and so forth
that ran in the Nicaraguan elections and
he said he would look into it do you
think he will will it will he can will
the United States continue to back his
so-called internal opposition yeah of
course because the internal opposition
are our agents I mean they are that's
the business base Dale eats they have
virtually no popular support in fact one
of the things that the press doesn't
publish is the polls in Nicaragua the
International polls which show that all
opposition parties together had nine
percent support over the last summer and
they've never been after they've never
been done you know part they have no
interest in democracy or anything like
that they want to get their own wealth
and power back and since their interests
happen to coincide with the interests of
us a late US business and investors and
so on the United States will support
them I don't think it should but it will
well we did that with also annoying and
Panama did Jim we supported Noriega as
long as he was useful I mean it's been
known that Noriega was a drug peddler
and I cooked for I don't know at least
since the late 70s if not before
possibly more dolly before I mean some
evidence that the Nixon administration
knew back in the early seventies but
certainly through this decade we knew
well Noriega ran a an election in 1984
it was a complete fraud George Shultz
was briefed right before the election by
the
CIA and the American ambassador telling
him that Noriega dosto lanai don't know
50,000 votes or something but Schultz
went down there to legitimize the
election and talk about how wonderful it
was and perilous Adventists is to do the
same and so on the reason was Noriega
was still doing the job that we asked
him to he became a nuisance later on he
turned out that aside from a crook he
also happened to be a nationalist and
when he was no longer willing to play
the game the way we wanted it we tried
to overthrow him in fact by such
ham-handed methods that we succeeded
they were the Reagan administration
succeeded in lining up support for
Nicaragua across the hemisphere although
everybody hates his guts that's a real
achievement yeah but this had nothing to
do with suddenly discovering that
Noriega was a gangster and a and a drug
peddler that was known all along what do
you think of Lawrence Brin the director
of a Miss very compared the direct
Laurent Lawrence burns yeah the director
of the Council on hemispheric affairs i
think is a very good organization and
their their weekly report on the
americas is one of the best sources of
information on Central America I'm glad
you said that supposed to yeah it's very
valuable yeah he goes into quite detail
yeah fact I was just I was just quoting
him without saying it what I was talking
about Norrie a guy's virtually quote
from a council on hemispheric affairs
should he give them great anything else
day well he was talking this morning
about the hunt of where the conquers
aren't Honduras you know and all the
refugees from the hurricane oh that's a
horrible situation how they're calling
it the little Nicaragua a new Nicaragua
well you see unfort is a very I mean you
know you really have to be ashamed of
this country but when the hurricane hit
Nicaragua that's just gonna have a
devastating effect on the country and
we're not giving them a penny of aid
that's real sadism isn't that the first
time at hurricane has ever hit in that
area well it's another than nothing i
think its first time in a century I
think and it's it's worse disaster than
the earthquake of 1972 remember at that
time we gave him a lot of aid which
ended up in the pocket of our buddies
somoza this time if you were to give
them aid it would go to the people which
is not what good is why we're not giving
it we want Nicaraguans to starve so that
then we can accuse the Sandinistas of
economic mismanagement
you mentioned that the government would
like to keep us dasol Placid is part of
this kinder and gentler America is that
a way of doing that that's part of the
public remember that any administration
has a big public relations component one
of the things they always turn to is the
public relations industry which gives
them advice on how to keep the
population quiet and apathetic and
satisfied and so on an awful lot of
politics is marginalizing the public
okay tonight you're appearing at Lewis &
Clark College at the fam lane' sports
center that talk tonight that begins at
seven-thirty that will be about it's
about US policy in Central America but a
lot of other things will come up ok and
then I will give out to wednesday and 30
there thursday there's other things
going on in town and I'll be letting the
people know about this in the next hour
but Rashad ski I want to thank you very
much for the serried appearance for this
afternoon much appreciated and then
anytime you're back in Portland you're
welcome to key rating you very much my
pleasure thank you very much
