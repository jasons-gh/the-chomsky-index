as you all know we are approaching the
seventh 70th anniversary of the founding
of the United Nations it's a good moment
to reflect on its origins its faith in
these your sins and prospects for the
future actually I was about your age at
the time of the founding of the United
Nations and the memories of those yet
hopeful days are still very much alive
the ashes of the most horrible war in
history were still smoldering the sheer
hideousness of the Nazi atrocities was
just coming to be recognized fully along
with the realization that human genius
had created the means for instant
destruction of the species had in fact
employed those means to vaporize two
Japanese cities in those bitter and
frightening days the UN Charter and the
founding of the United Nations provided
a desperately needed ray of hope it's
worthwhile to recall the opening words
of the Charter establishing the united
nations of quoted to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war
which twice in our life
time has brought untold sorrow to
mankind and to reaffirm faith in
fundamental human rights in the dignity
and worth of the human person in the
equal rights of men and women and of
Nations large and small and to establish
conditions under which justice and
respect for the obligations arising from
treaties and other sources of
international law can be maintained and
to promote social progress and better
standards of life in larger freedom the
Charter is one of the foundations of
modern international law it was soon
amplified a couple of years later by the
Declaration of Human Rights and over the
years by numerous United Nations General
Assembly conventions designed to
enabling conventions their call to
implement the principles and the rights
that are enunciated in resolutions
there's further amplification and the
judgments of the International Court of
Justice world for another international
tribunals and by Security Council
resolutions which alone have the full
force of law the amalgam is an
impressive body of doctrine though it
as fundamental flaws those are
recognized with some bitterness by most
of the world but often ignored by the
powerful the most serious flaw is pretty
obvious one the body of law that is
established is enforceable only against
the week the powerful are mostly immune
that's a matter degrading of great
importance particularly to people like
us citizens the United States a foreign
most powerful and influential state in
the international system and also in
many respects the most free of the
states of the international system that
combination we shall come back to a
number of times is of great significance
the United Nations can operate only
insofar as the Great Powers permit
that's obviously true for the five
powers that have feet the veto right at
the Security Council exercise a veto but
there of course many other forms of
influence and control the record of
vetoes is quite instructive worth
thinking about to understand the record
it's necessary to look at how power
relations have evolved over the years
and what you find is that the veto very
closely follows the course of
distribution of power in the
international system in quite revealing
ways so a couple of words on the two
briefings dematic at a few words on the
evolution of
our relations since 1945 in 1945 the
United States was of course far and away
the most powerful state in the world in
fact in world history long before that
it had been the most wealthy state in
the world the greatest economy and of
course has unique advantages not that
duplicated anywhere else in fact by some
measures the American colonies even
before independence were the richest
part of the world by the end of the 19th
century the United States had far
surpassed other economies even the
combination of other great economies
World War 1 greatly enhanced its
relative power the United States was
however not a major international actor
wasn't the leading actor in world
affairs that Britain though by then
declining I still had that role followed
by friends well world war two changed
all of that other industrial countries
were severely damaged or destroyed the
US economy boomed industrial production
in the United States quadrupled wartime
technologies laid the basis for rapid
post-war growth 1950s
1960s were the greatest growth period of
modern economies relatively egalitarian
growth so the lowest quintile that about
as well as the upper quintile let's
change the last generation pretty rad
occurred over 50s and 60s are sometimes
called by economists the Golden Age of
capitalism capitalism but when the
United when the United Nations was
formed in 1945 the u.s. literally had
half of the world's wealth nothing like
that in the history and it had
overwhelming middle military
predominance that the United States
controlled the entire hemisphere that
controlled both oceans controlled the
opposite sides of the oceans that is
unprecedented and of course the United
States alone at the time had the
ultimate weapon the atom bomb well
considering the circumstances no one
with any familiarity with history would
have doubted the outcome naturally the
US would largely control the United
Nations
those conditions and in fact it did and
it's also no surprise that with the Cold
War just beginning to heat up the United
States used his power to employ the
United Nations as a weapon against its
superpower enemy Soviet Union and one
direct result was Russian vetoes like
the US the Russians cast all the leaders
in the early years of the United Nations
by the 1960s the situation was changing
other industrial powers were recovering
from wartime devastation and crucially
decolonization was underway the imperial
systems were collapsing new states were
rising in the former imperial domains
and they were beginning to become actors
in the international system diversifying
power to an extent the US power was
still uncomfortable but it was the
climate infected again declining from
the late 1940s there's much talk these
days about American decline but it's
often overlooked that the decline began
in the late 40s as engine continuing
since flew the United States
compare so by 1970 the u.s. wealth was
about twenty five percent still
phenomenal quantity but it's much less
than fifty percent and it was in 1945 by
1970 the world was understood to be what
was called tri-polar three major
economic that areas industrial centers
Northam at us-based North American
german-based Europe and North East Asia
which already was most dynamic
developing region of the world it was
then Japan base later came to include
the advanced industrial economies of
Japan's former colonies Taiwan South
Korea or recently China some of the
Southeast Asian countries the world was
changed and the United Nations was
becoming more representative of the
nations of the world and that is
reflected in the record of vetoes which
changed corresponding to the
distribution power of the United States
faces first vetoed ever
19 7 it joined the Britain vetoing a
resolution that condemned the white
racist state of Southern Rhodesia since
that time the United States has been far
the lead in vetoing Security Council
resolutions frequent second many of the
u.s. vetoes have been in defensive
Israel where the oil sands virtually
alone in the General Assembly where
there's no veto votes on Israel
Palestine issues are regularly passed by
enormous majorities something like maybe
150 23 with the United States opposed
sometimes joined by some Pacific island
dependency for the dependency and much
the same is true of the annual votes on
the condemning the US embargo against
passed similar 182 to Israel one of the
reasons why the u.s. recently moved to a
degree of normalization with Cuba is it
the u.s. assembly becoming totally
isolated in the world and in fact
isolated in the hemisphere practically
barred from hence her medicine physician
articles are all quite important facts
and their Vitas on the other issues even
is alone and having vetoed a resolution
and Security Council two resolutions in
fact calling on all states to observe
international law the resolutions didn't
mention any country in particular but it
was understood that they were aimed the
United States which had just rejected a
World Court decision according the
United States to terminate what was
called it's unlawful use of force means
international terrorism against
Nicaragua and pay substantial
reparations us responded by rejecting
the decision to be doing to Security
Council resolutions calling on States
there
national law and effect escalating the
attack us international isolation then
was already quite significant increasing
and that was understood in high places
there was an official explanation from
the State Department as to why the
United States rejected the World Court
decision and he took the resolution it
was given by the State Department legal
adviser Abramson share pointed out all
quoted that the world majority often
opposes the United States on important
international questions so that we must
reserve to ourselves the power to
determine which matters fall essentially
within the domestic jurisdiction of the
United States as determined by the
United States in this case it was
international terrorism that practically
destroyed the targeted country that no
other country in the world can take that
position even our problems but that's
part of the prerogative of power that
you can do that that it remains
well this combination of power and
disregard of public opinion is is
natural those two things go together
power disregarded other opinion are very
natural partners and they are revealed
very dramatically when we consider the
most serious international crime the
crime of aggression concept well defined
in international law Assembly
resolutions signed by the United States
others it's understood aggression is
understood to be quote the supreme
international crime differing only from
other war crimes in that it contains all
of the evil the cause those are the
words of the Norberg judgment which
sentence Nazi war criminals death
founding principle of modern
international law well there are clear
cases of aggression in radical violation
of the UN Charter international law
global opinion the cases where the
aggression itself is the supreme
international crime and the evil that
follows is immense
present moment the most extreme case in
this millennium is the u.s. british
invasion of iraq in 2003 but there is no
thought that the consequences are
enormous it aside from virtually
destroying Iraq it set in motion and
sectarian conflicts which had not
previously existed which are tearing
Iraq to shreds and fair to the region
two trips Isis one extremely ugly
consequences but there's a thought of
any punitive attached comment on such an
idea of photo and though official
combination impossible the perpetrators
are immune simply because there are two
powers immune any action or even verbal
on that nation there is criticism within
a league serpent attracted criticism of
the aggression the most extreme
permissible criticism that you can find
articulated is the invasion failed so
President Obama has praised for being an
early opponent of the war but the
l'attention is paid often to the basis
position said it was a strategic blunder
that was the problem which means that it
succeeded it would have been fine that's
the most extreme criticism that can be
raised against a truly powerful state
other crimes of state are treated pretty
much the same way than articulate a pain
these practices are quite common the
world the sense is commonly accepted
within the violence paying attention to
us discourse in recent years Iran has
been described regularly as the greatest
threat to world peace standard phrase
government on tables after the words
these matters differently the
non-aligned movement the global South
vigorously endorses errands
they're aimed at developing nuclear
power though in fact it's not unlikely
that there are aimed at least in
capability of the capability to produce
weapons we'd enjoyed by a great many
countries which have a far lesser need
for deterrence that Iran does well to
remember that according to US
intelligence if your ends developing
nuclear weapons no but if it is it would
be partly determined strategy and though
rational analysts think possibility that
they use country vapor are the views of
the non-aligned countries global South
our assembly which represent the large
are in the world those are his regarded
in the West barely
okay and interestingly both of this myth
is international public opinion
the world was the beach it was not Quran
which ranked bread too low it was the
United States farm follow far behind by
Pakistan these packages are not barely
dismissed the bowl was not even reported
in the United States said the
prerogatives of power that is irrelevant
convenient it is a considerable interest
of popular opinion in the United States
the Burges quite significantly from that
of the decision-making classes and
articulate opinion so after support for
the United Nations remains very high
considerable charge us
population has generally held that the
United Nations take the lead
international conflict for majority even
held that the United States should
abandon the veto and follow
international opinion you don't approve
and such B's are so remote in the
opinion that were barely even
articulated and summon similars prove
the General Assembly conventions denied
the implement the provisions of
international law the u.s. actually
ratifies a very few of these and those
few are qualified reservations which
exclude the United States from their
jurisdiction of course the ratification
by others is typically quite
hypocritical accompanied by no intent to
live up that they find words but us
power and it's increasing isolation in
the world scene or illustrated
symbolically by the fact that the United
States assumes the right to be self
immunized from international law and the
so publicly well it's returned to the
most severe current threat the atomic
weapons the scientists who created
atomic weapons understood better than
anyone that humans now
face the prospect of self-annihilation
and they won't have been in the lead and
seeking to avert the fantastic they have
a publication Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists primary source of information
on these issues it has a famous Doomsday
Clock which is established 1947 which
estimates how close we are to the
midnight of self-annihilation couple
weeks ago the Doomsday Clock that's the
closest that's been the midnight for 30
years a moment which I'll return it's
with such concerns in mind that the
bearing that all members shall refrain
from the threat or use of force narrow
exceptions that's the most fundamental
principle of international law it's
remarkably remarkable to see how
commonly the principle is violated by
the United States and lesser powers act
as an extraterrestrial observer were
watching what
I would marvel at our inability to
appreciate the risks that were
consciously taking and they would
realize that we survived for 70 years
literally by Blind Luck technical record
it's quite sure why it's doing that not
only includes foolhardy decisions
choices of political leaders but also
just accident there have been a huge
number of cases we have a very close
predicted apartment that a nuclear
attack was taking place and a nuclear
response was stopped only but quick
human intervention with the systems
operate there's very little time well I
mentioned that the
just given examples like The Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists just published a
review of six years nineteen 677 1983
they mount probably hundreds of such
cases and the article concludes that
nuclear war is the Black Swan we can
never see except in that brief moment
when it is killing us we delay
eliminating the risk at our own peril
now's the time to rest but now we're
still alive by luck the finish by
quoting lead I mentioned the Doomsday
Clock said that just been moved two
minutes closer to midnight closes has
been in 30 years and there was a very
serious or scare the reasons now go
beyond the increasing threat of terminal
nuclear war you look at the announcement
in the bulletin of Atomic Scientists it
reads as follows it says unchecked
climate change global nuclear weapons
modernizations outside of the arsenal
the continued existence of humanity and
world leaders have failed to act with
the speed or on the scale required to
protect citizens from potential
catastrophe these offenders of political
leadership endanger every person on
earth the clock ticks now at three
minutes to midnight because
international leaders are failing to
perform their most important duty
insuring of human civilization you will
notice that this declaration false
political leadership without reason but
leaders do not act in a vacuum that even
in highly authoritarian states they're
constrained by the public and much more
so to the extent states are born free
and democratic and these considerations
bring us right back home despite many
abuses the United States remains unusual
on the states of the world and the
freedom that citizens enjoy to speak and
to act without fear or state violence
and repression furthermore the United
States remains by far the most powerful
state in the world extraordinary
advantage
security of great power and great
freedom provides unusual opportunity and
also unusual responsibility for American
citizens more than any others in the
world we are in a position to act to
bring the aspirations of the united
nations to fruition and the turn the
Doomsday Clock back far
Thank You professor Chomsky and now we
would like to introduce our charity
speaker flavor at veterans return home
from work adjusting back to civilian
life presents many challenges veterans
are forced to find a job to begin
transitioning back to an average
American lifestyle often while coping
with psychological difficulties these
struggles regularly upon newly returned
veterans in situations where fine
antiques stable housing is a daunting
task the New England Center for homeless
veterans works tirelessly to embed this
issue in our own community they offer a
training program that prepares veterans
to tackle job searches as well as a
housing program that covers several
tiers of need bossman 14th is proud to
be raising money for this amazing
charity throughout the duration of this
conference it's my pleasure to introduce
to you Anju McCauley the organization
see own president here today to speak to
you more about the work his charity does
well good evening folks I'm animal
calling I am here on behalf of the New
England Center for homeless veterans and
i do want to take just a couple of
minutes of your time to express our
appreciation my personal appreciation in
the appreciation of the veterans that we
serve for the support that you're
providing to the center into the bedlam
to serve so thank you very much also we
are based in Boston so I do want to
welcome all the delegates who may have
traveled from other locations here to
this great location congratulations for
for coming here and participating in
this very very educational and I think
you will find enlightening for model un
is obviously model Lab the United
Nations the United Nations is certainly
an institution and international
institution that is found was founded
and is dedicated to the ideals of
peaceful coexistence and I think that it
would be fair to say I'm certainly
probably biased in that regard because
people who serve in the United States
military citizens who like to join one
of the four services of the United
States are in fact a very strong force
for peace in our world they defend our
freedoms but i think they in a larger
from the larger perspective they are in
fact a very strong and effective force
for peace around the world that was my
experience in the 30 years that i served
and i think that that does reflect him
anyway
the missions of the United Nations so I
think there is some synergy and some
overlap there that and I guess that
might be my perspective but I want to
take just a little bit about the Senate
does I don't to take a lot of time
because this is obviously not that the
focus for this forum is but people who
serve in the military and then when they
return to civilian life are considered
veterans day our veterans they have
raised their right hand and sworn to
support to defend the Constitution of
the United States and when you return to
civilian life they are a very very
important and strong component in our
society and our community in the United
States today there are almost 22 million
veterans and their age an age range in
age from early 20s all the way up into
their nine reason into laundry it is a
very important but it is actually a
shrinking segment of our society it
represents just a little under seven
percent devices of our society of people
who represent or serve in the military
and veterans are very successful overall
for a number of different reasons people
who serve in the military I himself
select to serve in the military and they
tend to be people like yourselves who
reach outside themselves people who want
to be part of something important people
who want to be part of an important
mission to bring good to the world and I
think as a result of that they bring
those qualities as a post service
careers and live then they generally are
very successful I also think that some
of the characteristics some of the
skills some of the qualities that they
gained through their service their
ability to subordinate their own goals
and needs and sometimes safety and
health to the larger mission I think
also serves them well and they they do
very well there they are overall more
educated than the general
halation and they are more affluent and
they actually do very well but veterans
are people and people as you know
throughout their lives and as you as you
experience that you will see people
people just like nations and people all
of the world experience complexities in
their lives and challenges in their
lives and for veterans who experience
challenges sometimes when we're
transitioning from their time in the
service following that when they when
they experience challenges that they are
not able to be successful on their own
in the past and unfortunately currently
now some of them find themselves facing
that disruptive and disabling condition
of homelessness and homelessness is
something that I have been able to gain
an appreciation but in the inside work
with the center how destructive the
disabled does not reflect their boy it
does not reflect their debut question
where aspirations of order education
other than intelligence but it is a
disabling condition go england center
for homeless veterans goal in fact is to
end homelessness for every veteran who
may experience it and be part of a
larger national campaign a state
campaign in the city of austin campaign
to make homelessness for veterans in
this country something that is in
israel's just like the united nations
goal is to make something for open
conflict is something that's just in his
peoples and if we do that as was
described for a series of services to
veterans so legal services human
services where it's helping them have
gained house in helping them gain the
skills to be successful in employment
skills that help them overcome
disabilities they based
economic family estrangement and many
other factors that sometimes combined
the force veterans it's a small
percentage but on significant number of
votes to experience that homeless and in
any time of the year but most acutely
here this time of year when the weather
conditions in Boston and in many parts
of the country are so severe
homelessness it is something that no
person who has served their country we
feel should experience veterans are no
more deserving of any than any other
person but we think they are especially
in deserving one of the advantages of
having a campaign end homelessness among
veterans is to in fact come up with the
broader templates of social services in
our society and even around the world so
that homelessness overall for all the
citizens of this country and the
citizens of this world do not have to
experience that also so thank you very
much for your support
oh now like to welcome back
secretary-general to make closing
remarks
before we close these ceremonies I just
want to take a moment and dedicated to
our director general policeman cody
