so I'm just going to introduce you very
briefly and then we'll get started with
the questions is that okay okay all
right so for all of those of you who are
here welcome thank you very much for
showing up on a Thursday in the midst of
the crisis we're here to talk to
Professor Chomsky
who needs no introduction but just for
the those of you who don't know he is
one of the founders of modern
linguistics and a well-known social and
political critic he holds appointments
at this moment at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the
University of Arizona and has frankly
authored more books than I will ever
have the opportunity to read I think
it's coming up on a hundred now almost
correct
so welcome professor Chomsky to Tec de
Monterrey and zero books and thank you
very much for being here with us today
glad to be with you excellent so for
those of you who didn't get the memo we
have about seven questions for professor
Chomsky because we know that he's a very
busy man try to tell them so that
students had their interest reflected
but feel free a professor Chomsky to
elaborate on this as much as you want or
be as economical as you wish so the
first question we had for you was you've
been a critic of American foreign policy
and structures of domination for many
decades at this point and the kind of
big picture question we had for you is
do you think the world has become a
better place since you began writing and
talking about politics 40 things have
gone south over the last few decades
sort of a mixed story I began writing
publicly I'd been involved in political
action much before but again writing
publicly in the mid 60s at the time the
United States was engaged in the worst
crime since second worse since the
Second World War
there was almost no protest or
opposition a few of us who were trying
to arouse some protest we're facing
tremendous difficulties and meetings
were broken up public demonstrations
were broken up couple years later
opposition movement did develop in
Europe protest was there was some verbal
protest but protests were so slight that
in England for example the organizers
had to invite people from the United
States people like last I have stone me
the good England just to talk of
demonstrations but but that's changed a
lot opposition to aggression in the
major aggressive States has greatly
increased understood by leaders that
it's increased that they have to follow
different programs if you look back at
the George HW Bush administration first
wish after the collapse of the Soviet
Union they published internal strategies
erected some of which pointed out that
in the future we are going to be
fighting wars with much weaker enemies
and they have to be carried out quickly
and decisively because the public won't
supported otherwise well that was not
the case in the sixties public supported
just about anything I saw in that
respect that the world has gotten better
very other such respects it's gotten
worse in other ways not because of
what's happened but because we now know
things we didn't know that so for
example in the sixties it was just
beginning to barely be recognized by a
few scientists that we've entered
what is now known to be a new geological
ever seen in which human activity is
having significant and highly harmful
effects on the environment which may
actually destroy us in the
not-too-distant future in this
mysterious steps are taken that now is
traced back to the end a shattered world
war voter is not who was barely known at
the time the first we're gonna have
birthday soon but the first Earth Day
was I think 1970 first recognition that
something seriously wrong well that's a
big change lots of other changes can't
run through them but in some ways
there's been significant improvement and
other way this week it seems a pretty
gloomy shake right now the International
the vironment is highly threatening I'm
sure you know the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists every January publishes a
careful authorities assessment of the
international and security environment
it encapsulated all in a clock so-called
Doomsday Clock where they set the minute
hand a certain distance from midnight
started in 1947 after the first atomic
explosions and it's been oscillating
sins through the Trump term that's going
closer and closer to midnight last year
it reached the closest point that had
ever reached this last January had
exceeded that to a new level me or the
analysts abandoned minutes and moved to
seconds hundred seconds from midnight
just today they came out with an update
saying that it's even worse
in their assessment in January and they
focused on the same three things they
have focused on for some time the threat
of nuclear war which is increasing
threat of environmental destruction
which is increasing and a third thing
which they just brought up last year's
reiterated this year and focused on
today and that is the increasing
dysfunctional nature of governance
governments are becoming completely
dysfunctional they are unable to act in
a coherent way they're unable to act in
a cooperative way as they point out this
is highlighted by the reaction to the
pandemic that you know that's now raging
they cite the fact that last September
the World Health Organization know much
Munder hundred malicious and criminal
attack in the United States the World
Health Organization and last September
issued a strong warning of a potential
potential pandemic called on countries
to get make preparations for it there
were many other early warnings nothing
was done as China released the basic
information about three and Emma Caen
Burleigh January some countries reacted
the East Asian countries they reacted
very effectively China itself now seems
to have it more or less under control
Taiwan almost perfect control of
Singapore South Korea have another lot
of cases but they read it very quickly
now under control
New Zealand seems to be eradicated
Europe temporized they didn't pay much
attention they waited much too long but
they finally
act in Britain as the worst wreck of the
year at the bottom of the barrel
completely is the United States the
worst record in the world because of the
set of clowns in Washington who are very
good at blaming everybody else in the
world but can't do anything years I mean
in fact well the Trump of the US
intelligence through January and
February was trying to reach the White
House to tell them look there's a
serious problem
the pandemic is spreading they couldn't
get through
Trump was too busy watching his own
ratings on video or playing golf saying
it's just the flu forget about it yes at
the same time January and February the
US was actually exporting ventilators
and masks and other equipment to China
and other countries to try to improve
the trade balance now they're desperate
lyrium boarding the same things the
level wasn't until March way to the the
Trump finally recognized something's
happening gave all sorts of
contradictory instructions which
continue the United States is the only
country in the world major country that
cannot even provide data to the World
Health Organization on the number of
cases and deaths because it's to
dysfunction and there has been very
little cooperation a Germany for example
managed to handle the situation within
Germany reasonably we'll quite low death
wave right across the border and from
Germany and lumbering northern Italy the
epidemic is raging
are they getting any help from Germany
they're supposed to be something cool
that European Union sorry we don't give
help to people across our board that
fortunately there is one country of the
world that is genuinely internationalist
so they're sending a tea to Italy
that's Cuba of course which does this it
has now has thousands of doctors working
in other countries as it's been doing
for many years that's genuine selfless
internationalism whose way back there
being helped by China which is providing
equipment and some doctors but that's it
what the West is doing is different just
mentioned the what the US is doing right
now is killing support for the World
Health Organization because Trump thinks
that may improve his ratings among his
voting base I mean well killing many of
people and increasing the risk of
Americans if the pandemic rages in Latin
America Africa or places where the World
Health Organization is working on a
spread to the United States that's
obvious
so Trump and his administration are
perfectly happy to kill Americans kill
many other people in order to improve
his ratings for the election that you
can't get more dysfunctional than that a
lot of the countries of this the kind of
cooperation an interaction that should
be taking place is barely happening and
it's happening at the most advanced
level under the most oppressed by the
most oppressed countries worth
remembering that Cuba has been subjected
to vicious us economic warfare him
outright terror ever since they gained
independence but
are the ones with the internationals the
u.s. is doing the opposite well I can
give many other examples but that's the
assessment of the bulletins of analysts
today and I think it's pretty accurate
thank you very much Chuck presto Chomsky
that was a very comprehensive answer and
actually my friend was interested in
getting your opinion on the possibility
of nuclear war on the 21st century so
even managed to adjust that so thank you
the next question we had actually
touches on the end of your previous
comment which is the fact that we've
seen many of these new reactionary and
populist movements emerging countries
across the globe the United States
Britain hungry people in Brazil India
and we were wondering if you could
account for why it is that populism has
become very attractive to many people in
the 21st century and the second part of
that question is can you distinguish
between a left populist like um low or
Lula and the right-wing populist that we
see people like Victor Orbin and Donald
Trump because many of our students have
been unclear about what the distinction
is well you should be unclear because
the term is used in very strange ways
and there was that come to term populist
goes back to its radical Democratic
movement in American history late
nineteenth century the most radical
democratic movement ever in American
history one of the most in the world was
radical farmers in Texas and Kansas
mainstream America who wanted to break
free of the stranglehold of the northern
fanciers who controlled the markets
bankers and so on so they set up their
own independent self-managed it's just a
Vedic society they arranged for the
banks the loans and market says
democratically run was very expensive
they began to link up with the first
major American trade union the Knights
of Labor which is a pretty
radical movement they believe for
example that cooker main slogan those
who work in the mills would own them
there should be no wage labor that's the
same as slavery there should be only the
people running their own affairs
controlling their own the institution's
the workers running enterprises
democratic control this was an enormous
movement it was broken up mainly by
violence state and corporate violence
but that's populism it's not what's
called populism today ok what's called
pocket ism today is just an outburst of
anger the resentment hatred of
governments and it's justified you take
a look at what governments have been
doing for the last 40 years 40 years ago
under the direction of Ronald Reagan
Martin Thatcher who Reagan of course was
just a voice for the people who were
handing image scripts from the corporate
sector initiated a new provision of the
capitalist system there had been a
period of what was called regimented
capitalism the most self-destructive
elements of capitalism that were being
controlled Reagan and Thatcher toward
that to shreds we move into the
neoliberal era which is designed where
policy is designed to concentrate wealth
to hand over decision-making from
governments which are at least partially
responsive to the population and it over
to private tyrannies corporations
private tyrannies which are totally
unaccountable to the population and
whose goal solely is greed that's the
official doctrine handed down by Milton
Friedman's causing economists
corporations have no role they no to
anything except
maximize their own profit and of course
the the wealth of managers and directors
and the rest of the puppet the
population could stagnate that's
happening all over the world that
America suffered from two decades of
strangling structural adjustment barely
started to recover from it in the Europe
this was compounded by austerity
programs which actually no economic
basis but just amplified the harmful
literally harmful effects of the
neoliberal programs in the United States
wages real wages are about what they
were before the programs were instituted
a lot of wealth has been accumulated
it's gone into very few pockets I mean
we can see the neoliberal programs at
work right on the front pages today
right now so the Republican
administration issued a stimulus bill
okay huge stimulus bill would it go to
like the airline's for example the
airlines are requesting fifty billion
dollars from the taxpayer why do they
need fifty billion dollars just look at
what they've been doing since the
financial crisis they've been gorging on
profits if they've been using the
profits to build the enterprise know at
the same 50 billion went to stock
buybacks which just inflate of the stock
value enriched the mostly wealthy stuff
host instead the stockholders and raise
management salaries to the stratosphere
why can they do that
thanks to Ronald Reagan Kri Reagan that
was illegal there were no stock Greg
Beck's
there were no tax havens we couldn't
pretend your office in Bermuda and not
pay taxes that was illegal and it was
enforced Brig
open the speaker that's tens of
trillions of dollars of robbery the
public happening right in front of our
eyes once again another hammer blow from
the neoliberal assault
well people may not know the details but
they can say men say in American workers
can knows that he can't get but he can't
get by to his next paycheck that they
know and they know that there's plenty
of wealth around so they're angry and
frustrated and despise the government
well so there and that's fertile
territory for demagogues who can come
and say on your saver
it's all the fault of those immigrants
you know the rapists and murderers
coming from Mexico the refugee you guys
fleeing from Libya to try to get into
our country they're responsible for them
or some other scape now the World Health
Organization
that's what demagogues do and it can be
successful we see it in the case as you
mentioned so yes there are reactionary
governments arising all over the world
with a popular base nothing to do with
populism a popular based based on
justified anger resentment miss directly
with justified and that offers
opportunities to overcome it directed in
the right direction and that's being
done not enough but someone so the
Sanders campaign the United States which
is regarded by many people as a failure
was in fact a great success and then
Norman says it shifted the entire agenda
of destruction and discussion debate
policy far to the left the things that
were not even could just be ridiculed a
couple of years ago are not right in the
middle of the legislative agenda the
it's a very enormous success as in his
withdrawal speech
Sanders emphasized Rachel's at the end
this campaign may be over but the
movement in tinglies and that's exactly
the right message elections mean when
you take 15 minutes and push a lever but
then you go back to work and make the
real changes same things happening in
Europe with the m25 the movement
initiated by Yanis varoufakis others is
trying hard to salvage what is good in
the European Union and dismantle the
stuff that's rotten and their
maintenance embroideries this November
there's going to be the inaugural
meeting of the Progressive International
launched by Sanders and our fathers
that's an institutional framework to
bring together popular movements which
will counter the right-wing
international that's being forged in
Washington and if there is one the one
semi-coherent the geo strategic plan
that you can extract from the chaos in
Washington is the construction of a
reactionary international very
systematic headed in Washington
incorporating every reactionary and
brutal state in the world in the Middle
East
CiCi's Egypt worst dictatorship in Egypt
from favor that's in Saudi Arabian
dictators your family dictatorship the
United Arab Emirates family dictatorship
harsh brutal dictatorships that Israel
was right in the center of it moving way
to the right now in close ally of the
son of the Gulf dictatorships Modi's
India granted Modi's trying to destroy
secular democracy in India Institute an
ultra-right Hindu nationalist
autocracy crushing the major Muslim huge
Muslim my judgements minority hundreds
of millions of people destroying Kashmir
nice people like Orban and hungary
basically establishing an elective
dictatorship salvini and italy's main
goal in life is to see how many africans
you can get to drown in the
mediterranean they're being put together
in a reactionary in their management
it's taking shape it's right before our
eyes and the Progressive International
is an effort to counter it an
overwhelming and the future of the world
is going to end on who wins that
struggle yeah I find that very moving
and I recall actually at the end of
Sanders campaign when he was talking
about how the movement continues and I
was just opposing that against Trump who
in 2015 said this country is broken and
I and I alone can fix it and what a
total difference there is between
Sanders who believes that there's a
movement for substantive change and
Trump who really seems to believe only
in himself and invest himself with all
this kinds of significance so my next
question for you professor Chomsky and I
know that you have a busy schedule so do
you mind if we limit it to two more yeah
perfect okay so it's about intellectuals
and the role intellectuals should play
so you're very well known for your
debates with people like Bill Buckley
and you're also quite known for some of
your disputes with individuals on the
Left people aleksa Dziedzic chuckle calm
michel foucault
your debate is you've been viewed on
YouTube several million times and these
people are on the more left end of the
spectrum but I come from more
continental standpoint so I'm wondering
first off what do you think the role of
a left-wing critical theorist are
critical intellectuals should be today
and if you think there are people who
are doing good work and a left-wing
critical theory or people whose work you
would recommend as a step in the right
direction
step back for a minute to look at the
history of intellectuals I see the word
intellectual and its current usage goes
back to the Dreyfus trial
the word was used but not in the current
sense the Dreyfus ORS the ones are
called defended Dreyfus against the
state effort to basically destroy him
for his on totally fabricated grounds
m/l Zola and others they were the first
decent intellectuals
how are they treated
they were bitterly denounced by the
Immortals of the Academie Francaise you
know the very thinkers
how can these writers artists dare to
criticize our noble state and our great
army and our wonderful institutions the
animals over himself was forced to flee
France to escape imprisonment that's
typical of intellectuals ever since and
long before long before the word was
used there were people who were sort of
intellectuals and our sins
back to the beginning as reported
history let's go to classical Greece but
there was somebody in classical Greece
who was irritating the establishment as
they put it he was corrupting the youth
of Athens by asking too many questions
and what happened to him was forced to
commit suicide now take the biblical
record there were people who were
condemning the evil Kings
carrying out geopolitical analysis
saying you're going to destroy the
country calling for mercy through widows
and orphans and so on what happened to
them they were imprisoned driven into
the desert to vilify you know many
centuries later they were on it but the
people who were honoured at the time
with the flatterers at the court the
ones who were later called false
prophets knew run ribbit to the prison
same story
well there's the great mass of
intellectuals or flatterers at the court
supporters of power apologists for
violence and so on and my accident just
happened to be in correspondence with
one of them whose bitterly critical a
nice person incidentally nice liberal
intellectual literally critical of the
crimes against the Chinese dissident I
wait way Randleman distance like
terribly they've treated
I asked me at one point can you give me
the names
of the six latin-american meeting Latin
American intellectuals Jesuit priests
who had their heads blown off by the
brigade and I'll solve the door that was
armed directed by the United States
acting monkey I think on the direct
orders of this from the central command
you need to know what I was talking
about
well that's universal yeah we're very
outraged about things that enemies do
you know and know about the much worst
crimes that we support and of course in
a free society like the United States
silence is support when often it's
direct simply that's typical of
intellectuals okay there are those who
are cold the wild men in the wings
that's McGeorge Bundy yeah - Kennedy is
a national security adviser my former
Harvard Dean he met he said yes there
are reasonable critics of the Vietnam
War who say we're making mistakes we
should have a better strategy and then
there are the wild men in the wing who
criticized the war is completely wrong
I was women so yes that's true they are
the wild men in the wings and there's
the massive clatter of the court that's
a stir event electric write to the
president what's their role it's to be
wild men in the wing that's the way role
they should be playing that we honor the
ones in enemy countries who served their
role at home the values are inverted the
ones we honor in enemy countries right
at home the one who we vilify in enemy
countries Thomas or Claire's we honor at
home that's the history of intellect
really it's sometimes illustrated with
astonishing clarity and licorice can't
see this of course we look at the
history a bright
it's totally different we're wonderful
the three independent I take a look at
the first little board
very striking example in every country
the intellectual class strongly lustily
supported their own state so it was a
famous declaration of 94 German
intellectuals leading German
intellectuals issued a plea to the West
to recognize that the country of canta
no Beethoven that occurred to is doing
all the right things know exactly the
same happened in Britain exactly the
same happened in the United States and
France in every country now there were
wild men in the wings scattering with
intellectuals who disagree refused to
accept the propaganda where were they in
jail Bertrand Russell in England Rosa
Luxemburg Germany Eugene Debs in the
United States well that's the way it is
that's the history of intellectuals I
mean in retrospect I know everyone
agrees that the wild men in the wings
were right one of the massive
intellectuals were selling out not at
the time okay and that's
the history and it tells you the answer
what they should be doing absolutely and
I find it remarkable that you brought up
Socrates because of course many of the
reactionary commentators today like to
talk about the glories of Western
civilization and its traditions and
accomplishments without ever recognizing
that one of its seminal figures God has
started as a critic talking about why we
need to constantly question our
traditions our conventions and the
expectation that what we're doing is
right if we're genuinely to commit
ourselves to intellectual integrity so
but that of mine I'll ask you to laugh
ask question which is a bit more of a
broad one and I think it's actually in
keeping since I remember you mentioned
that not all life is about politics and
since many of us are interested in
philosophy and theory you've become very
well known for your account of human
nature your defense of the Enlightenment
and your seminal contributions to
generative linguistics and resuscitating
the rationalist tradition more broadly
and I was wondering if you could give an
account of your theory of human nature
as it stands now and maybe how your
thought on this matter has developed
over the years let's see if I understood
so considering what we know about human
nature what does it tell us about the
problems today very little what we know
about human nature is basically that
whatever humans do falls within human
nature why
definition so humans can be courageous
noble interactions we see it right now
today the doctors and nurses working in
impossible conditions forced to make
agonizing decisions about who to kill
exposing them to danger because of the
malicious malfeasance of their own
governments which didn't provide them
with equipment doesn't provide them with
support that's one side of new human
nature the other side of human nature
you see in the White House or in the
presidential palace in Brazil we see
people who were true sociopaths
dedicated to destroying to killing
people to making life as harsh as
possible for those who are not
privileged and wealthy and also to
destroy human civilization all the
things that Trump is doing today pale
into insignificance as compared with his
consciously lead leading the race to
disaster by maximizing the use of fossil
fuels knowing perfectly will that that's
going to make organized society
impossible in a generation or two budget
perfectly well
just this morning is Environmental
Protection Agency which used to be a
free Trump Houston a serious agency
announced eliminated at regulations on
toxic emissions so now fossil fuel
plants are permitted to emit mercury to
poison children in the United States
more pollutants to make sure that the
people that global warming increases and
the more people died from pollution well
that's what's happening before our eyes
so okay
two aspects of human nature two extremes
well you can see you genuine
internationalism like Cuba you can see
self-centered concern for ourselves like
Germany the United States we don't often
talk about our the way for the u.s. the
Trump administration the way to deal
with the crisis is to destroy the
institution that's helping people
especially poor people cope with it to
intensify the war against Yemen worst
humanitarian crisis in the world and so
on
two aspects of human nature so what is
human nature tell us there's a lot of
possibilities and we can decide which
aspects of human nature we want to bring
to the floor which ones we want to
suppress and eliminate
thank you very much professor Chomsky so
I believe that's all the time that we
have I just wanted to express our
extraordinary gratitude for your taking
the time today and we know you have a
very busy schedule to talk to us about
some of the issues that are going on in
the world and I look forward to reading
your next book if I'm able to get
through the last fifty five or whatever
it happens to be but please but thank
you very much and we hope that the
students will express their gratitude to
you as well thank you very we're glad to
have a chance to talk with you yourself
as well have a good day sir thank you
so thank you everyone for coming and if
you have any questions that you look
forward to just send me an email and I
hope you all enjoyed that and found it
informative and of interest on this on
Tuesday on Thursday
you
