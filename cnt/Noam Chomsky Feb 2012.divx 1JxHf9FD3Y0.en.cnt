the viral growth of the Occupy movement
in the public support of it is testament
to the tremendous dissatisfaction with
the inequities and abuses of corporate
capitalism the slogan we are the 99
percent is resonating with many people
what is your view of the potential
strength of this type of mass protest
and its possibility to affect social
change well the Occupy movement already
has had a number of significant
successes one of them as you say is to
kind of change the national discourse of
these concerns and fears and so on were
of course prevalent for a long time for
perfectly objective reasons having to
with changes in the socio-economic
system in the last 30 or 40 years but
they weren't crystallized very clearly
until the Occupy movement put them
forward and now they're kind of common
coin so 99 percent and one percent the
radical equality the farcical character
of purchased elections the movement
corporate shenanigans that led to the
current crisis and have been crushing
people for a long time than overseas
wars and so on what are the that's one
major contribution the other one is not
discussed so much but I think it's
pretty important the this is an
extremely atomized society if people are
alone there it's the very business
around society and the very explicit
goal of the business world is to create
a social order in which the basic social
unit is you and your television set in
which you're watching ads and going out
to purchase commodity and this
tremendous efforts made to its monthly
on for a century and a half as to try to
induce this kind of consciousness and
the social order in fact if you go back
say a hundred and fifty years our early
days of the Industrial Revolution right
here in Massachusetts where it started
there was very lively press at the time
probably the period of the greatest free
press in the United States all kinds of
press ethnic labor anything and the
labor press which was extremely
interesting and lively in participatory
had a great many harsh criticisms of the
industrial system that was being imposed
in which people were being driven but
one of the core criticisms was what 150
years ago they called the new spirit of
the age gain wealth forgetting all but
self which they considered you know
savage and inhuman and it was being
trying to driv it into their heads 150
years later they're still trying to
drive it into people's heads gain wealth
for getting old itself and now it's
considered a kind of an ideal but it's
also intolerable to human beings one
effect of the Occupy movement has been
simply to spontaneously create small
social systems of solidarity mutual
support the cooperation cooperative
kitchens and libraries and health
services general assemblies in which
people actually interact and so on
that's something very much missing in
the society and when we talk about
potential part of the potential would be
to first will maintain those bonds and
associations after the tactic has
outlived its usefulness and tactics do
outlive their usefulness
but after that happens if the what has
been learned and internalized can be
sustained and extended that would be
very important in itself how the other
dimension is how much can you engage the
rest of the so-called 99 percent in
these activities concerns interactions
and so on that's the next big step that
has to be taken many in the Occupy
movement have realized that political
democracy is controlled by big money few
however of expressed an economic
democracy is essential for a truly
democratic society the progressive
utilization theory are proud advocates
economic democracy to empower people and
communities the co-operative management
of most enterprises economic democracy
requires that the minimum requirements
of life being guaranteed everyone and
decision making me decentralized so
people have the right to choose how
their local economies are run it's the
responsibility of all levels of
government to promote policies that
achieve full employment do you think an
economic democracy and local economies
could move us forward well first of all
this is the traditional stand of the
left so if you go back again 150 years
ago to the same newspapers I was
mentioning one of their demands was that
those who work in the mills should own
and of course manage them that was the
slogan of the Knights of Labor the made
huge labor organization had developed
the 19th century European socialism was
mostly coming at several branches but
the the more left branches if you like
were essentially the same committed to
workers councils community organizations
guild socialism in England was this name
I mean this is the traditional thrust of
the socialist movement
it's not understood here because as I
said again this is a very business run
society you're not allowed to know any
of these things so socialism is some
kind of a bad word you know well okay
that's what happens in a highly
controlled society highly indoctrinated
society but these are very familiar
goals and yes in fact there I even go
the leading social philosopher in the
United States and who everyone
recognizes it John Dewey who just took
this for granted his as he put it unless
every institution in society that
industry farming communications media if
all of them unless they're under popular
Democratic controlled by participation
by the workforce in the community he
said politics will just be the shadow
cast over society by big business that's
the alternative you can't have
meaningful political democracy without
functioning economic democracy and I
think this is at some level understood
by working people that has to be brought
to awareness and consciousness but it's
just below the surface and in fact
things are happening so some of the most
interesting or around the in Ohio around
the Cleveland area Cleveland project
there's a dozen maybe hundreds of not
huge but significant enterprises that
are worker owned worker managed in some
places there are the biggest one the
biggest worker owned the collection of
conglomerate is Mondragon and the vast
country that's where your own but not
worker managed and it's a you know
industries banks and schools
community is very broad the
configuration and there are various
other elements of it you're in there a
couple of quite good books just come out
about it one by gar alperovitz America
beyond capitalism which is about the
worker on the enterprises that are
sprouting around the country this could
go much beyond so for example just look
at about a couple of years ago the
government effectively nationalized the
auto industry came pretty close to it
and there were a couple of choices one
choice which is the the choice that's
reflexive in a business run system is to
reconstitute it hand it back to the
original owners or people very much like
them and let them pursue the same course
they were pursuing before it's one
possibility that was of course part of
the choice was undertaken without
discussion but there was another choice
and if there had been a live functioning
Occupy movement at the time it could
have put that other choice on to the
national agenda it have to be much more
larger and more organized than it is now
but there's only a few months after all
the other choice was to hand the auto
industry over to the workers in the
community and have them own and manage
and run it and have it directed to
things that the country needs there are
after all things that we very badly need
as ciety one of the most obvious is
high-speed rail the United States just
off the international spectrum in this
respect and it's a kind of a scandal
that's a it's economically harmful and
socially harmful just a humanly harmful
not logically ecologically harmful I
mean everything think of it's just
ridiculous and the skilled workforce in
the what's called the Rust Belt could
easily be
a reconfigured to do that to people like
Seymour Melman had been arguing about
that for him for that for years it might
take some kind of federal aid or but
nothing like what was safe poured into
the banks and to make this even more
ironic at the very time that Obama was
reconstituting the auto industry and
handing it back to normal ownership he
was also sending its transportation
secretary to Spain to get contracts for
high-speed rail from the Spanish who are
way more advanced than we are or the
French or the Germans and here you have
this industrial system sitting there
workers wanting to work communities
wanting to have their own lively work
based communities and the country
needing things badly but they can't be
put to get it that's quite a we have to
go somewhere else like to Spain to get
them to help us out I mean it's an
incredible condemnation of the semi
functioning system and that's the kind
of thing that a an Occupy movement when
it moves beyond this particular tactic
should be addressing and things like
that are happening all over the country
there was one right here about two years
ago a small but sophisticated
manufacturing enterprise pretty
successful in one of the Boston suburbs
I was producing specialized equipment
for aircraft or wood and the
multinational that owned it wanted to
shut it down maybe not make enough
profit for them or something the the
Union ue pretty progressive Union and
the workforce offered to buy it and run
it themselves with community support
well a company wouldn't agree I suspect
they lost money on it but the problem I
don't know but I suspect just for class
reasons the idea of worker own worker
managed successful enterprise does it is
peeling whatever the reasons they closed
it down and so now that town doesn't
have the industry in which it's partly
based well you know again with a live
progressive activist movement that
reached out to many parts of the
community that I should have been
salvaged and there are things like that
all over so yes it's a right thing to do
it's a deeply ingrained in the American
tradition and it's been suppressed by
the nature of a highly class conscious
business class which is always without
stop fighting a bitter class war they
know exactly what the doing is very
coordinated and controlled and it's true
everywhere but it's you especially so in
the United States happens to be unusual
in this respect we see many consequences
of it it's gone about 1% because the
physical resources of the planet are
limited the hoarding of wealth or using
it for speculation rather than
productive investment produces the
opportunities for other people and
causes bobert a fundamental principle
proud is to limit the accumulation of
wealth and create a maximum salary
that's tied to the minimum wage just as
all the salaries in all the forms of
government of the United States have pay
scales where the starting salary is no
no letter no more than 10 times what the
highest you know pay scale is for a
president or a general or a present or a
judge you know so what is your opinion
about limiting the accumulation of
wealth well first of all there are much
more far reaching the goals than that so
another traditional ideal of the left
movement has been
from each according to his ability his
ability to each according to his need
and actually that's a pretty popular
idea there was in 1976 on the 200th
anniversary of the Declaration of
Independence there were polls taken
asking people what do you think isn't
giving them list of kind of statements
and they were supposed to judge which
ones you think are in the Constitution
well nobody knows what's in the
Constitution so the question if they're
answering is which ones are obvious
truism so there must be in the
Constitution this one was got a
considerable majority you know I think
people think you know make sense the pay
scale issue is a it's one reflection of
first of all the a lot of it has to do
with financialization of the economy
this is a new phenomenon I mean of
course there's always been financed has
always been you know financial crashes
and so on but it was a big change in the
1970s the New Deal had instituted an
array of regulations among which were
regulations which essentially determined
that banks were banks that as they were
to do what vak is supposed to do in a
state capitalist economy you can argue
that it's the wrong kind of economy I
would for example I suppose you would
but in that kind of economy banks have a
function they're supposed to take unused
capital somebody's bank account and
transmitted to some kind of productive
action like starting a business or buy a
house or whatever it may be and they
more or less did then there were no
crashes in the 50s and 60s the biggest
growth period in American history also a
period of extremely by our standards
current standards very high taxation of
the wealthy
very fast growth gillet Aryan growth no
crashes well that changed in the
seventies in books accelerated under
Reagan the and that was with a freeing
up of constraints on capital so the
currencies had been more or less
regulated they were free and the other
constraints on capital were dropped so
he had a huge explosion of speculative
capital to overwhelm capital markets by
now by 2007 right before the latest
crash and the next one will come later
is a financial institutions have about
forty percent of corporate profits and
they weren't helping the economy in fact
one of the maybe the most respected
financial correspondent in the world is
at least the english-speaking world is
Martin wolf of the Financial Times he
simply describes these institutions as
like larvas that attached to a host and
eat it away from the inside the host
that he's talking about is the market
system of course she proves it as
they're just eating it away from the
inside sites figures showing how harmful
them but they do accumulate a lot of
capital for then very few hands and
that's one of the reasons that led to
the pretty sharp concentration of income
the one-percent image is a little
misleading because it's really one tenth
of one percent that's where you find the
enormous concentration of wealth you go
down below and the one percent and you
know the wealthy would not not by
spectacular standards so yes it
concentrated wealth in a tiny percentage
of the society I'm substantially hedge
fund managers and CEOs of natural
corporations
someone and that translates itself
almost reflexively into political power
you also had at the same time and
parallel the sharp rise in spending for
elections so but of course by now it's
just totally out of sight that's right
on the front pages but but by the early
80s it was already substantially
increasing that compels the parties to
dig into corporate profits and people
say unions and corporations but
essentially corporations that's where
the money is an increasingly financial
corporation so they increasingly
essentially by the elections now they
also by Congress in many ways so for
example I suppose the United States the
only parliamentary system where and very
recently incidentally winter before
where to get a position of some
influence in Congress a a chair of a
committee which used to accrue to
seniority and service and some fish and
now you just have to pay the party and
then you can qualify to the chair so
that drives the rest of you into the
same pockets the Republicans stopped
even pretending to be a political party
about 20 years ago or so now that just
totally enthralled to the one tenth of
one percent that one of the reasons the
Republican debates are such a total
farce is that an order in order to
mobilize voters they can't come to the
voters with their actual policies nobody
a vote for them so they have to appeal
to pretty unpleasant tendencies in the
population that have always been there
but are now mobilized and you get it you
get the picture you see there I won't go
through it the world can't believe what
they're seeing but it's a natural result
of high of the fact that the party
essentially abandoned any pretense of
being a parliamentary party in the
normal sense and is just driven
the service of the one fraction of 1%
the the Democrats aren't that far behind
and the Democrats or what used to be
called moderate Republicans they've all
been kicked out of the party in fact if
you look something somebody like say
eisenhower it would be considered a
radical leftist than the current
spectrum nixon pretty much on the left
you know even Reagan would be more or
less on the left but those are changes
that have taken place in since 7250 80s
well that one consequence another aspect
of this was deregulation another in
which of course led predictably to
repeatable crashes ever since the Reagan
years and another element was changes in
corporate governance rules of corporate
governance so for example by now a
factor last 30 years and CEO can
effectively choose the board that grants
him salary and stock options well you
can predict what's going to happen from
that so now if you compare say the
United States and Europe pretty similar
society the ratio of pay to top
management as compared with workers is
far higher here than in comparable
societies and not because they are more
talented as maybe David Brooks will tell
you and so on or because they perform
any service it is in fact they mostly
probably harm the economy but just
because you know it's like if you tell
people you can pick your own salary okay
so yes that's a big problem and if the
United States were to say just to return
to what it was nothing very utopian or
to be like other industrial societies
there's not a very good model but you
know certainly not dopey and then this
vast chasm between the top
remuneration and the workforce would
sharply shrink but my feeling is that's
nowhere near enough we ought to be have
as an ideal at least the traditional
left ideal you this kind of a conception
of work that underlies this that there
are different conceptions of what work
is as comes right of debates it during
the Enlightenment but one conception is
work is something that you have to be
driven to you wouldn't do it unless you
were forced by starvation it's something
you hate but you have to do because you
can't live otherwise that's basically
the capitalist construction work there's
another conception which is work is the
highest ideal in life free creative work
under your own control is exactly what
any human being would choose if they
could and there are places where that
ideal is practiced like if you walk down
the halls at MIT you'll find people
working maybe 80 hours a week they could
make a lot more money in the stock
market but they doing interest they love
it you have yep things you'd like to do
if you mean I know the Carpenters are
the same way and their spare time they
go out in the and make an
interesting good thing that's what they
like to do that's a different conception
of work now if under the second
concepcion basically the Enlightenment
conception there's no reason why that
pay should relate to the amount of work
you do it's nothing to it you do the
work you weren't being paid if the work
is under your own control and do your
own choice I mean a kind of a graphic
enlightenment image of this acted by one
of the founders of classical liberalism
humbled was that if an artisan produces
a beautiful object on command we admire
what he did but we despise what he is
namely a tool in the hands of others on
the other hand if he creates it under
his own will and choice out of his own
concerns and interests we admire what he
did and who he is actually Adam Smith
said pretty similar things these are now
this is traditional conservative ideas
if the word conservative has any meaning
but the capitalist conception is quite
different you work on the under a lash
and therefore those who allegedly work
harder actually they don't it should get
you know multimillion-dollar stock
options but these are just extremely
different conceptions and they lead to
all sorts of different idea that how
society
you have written known slavery the
oppression of women working people and
other severe violations of human rights
have been able to endure in part because
in various ways the values of the
oppressors have been internalized by the
victims that is why
consciousness-raising is often the first
step in liberation what do you think are
the most important ways to raise
consciousness to free us from the values
of the oppressors that are stuck inside
us should say that again I don't take
any credit for that view it's a very old
one you can read David Hume for example
another one of the founders of classical
liberalism great philosopher wrote fount
abroad on foundations of government and
he said he said the first principle of
government they said it was something
that is that strikes him when he looks
at history was also historian that he
struck by the easiness with which the
the governed except the rule of the
governs governors he says this is
paradoxical because power is in the
hands of government power is not in the
hands of the rulers so how is this
miracle maintained well he says it's by
control of opinion if the governor's can
control opinion and attitude then impose
the what leader was called false
consciousness that you were describing
you know then they can rule but if you
can break that then they're gone they
can't and stand up against the
government so how do you break it well
all the ways we know also say take
slavery I mean they were first it wasn't
it was never a peaceful period of
slavery they were always slave revolts
the slave families found their own ways
of constructing islands of freedom
within the sadistic society they were
part of
occasionally these lived in actual major
revolt which were violently crushed the
finally you know it led to after far too
long of course it did lead to
abolitionism and the formal elimination
of slavery though we should note formal
because in fact many ways it still
remained even well the Civil War
technically amendments and
constitutional amendments during Thor
did in fact formally end slavery but it
was reconstituted about ten years later
by criminalization of black life
north-south compact which essentially
frequently constituted as you the young
and now it's forget we're going through
something like that now take a look at
the incarceration rate the but takes a
woman's right well that's more that's of
course also goes far back but it didn't
really become a substantial movement
until the 1970s other words of it in the
60s and sixties activism but and the way
it began was small consciousness-raising
groups that groups of women talking to
each other and they're trying to break
through the general assumption that this
is the way it has to be there are no
choices women are supposed to be
property in fact if you look at American
law the women remained essentially
property well into the 1970s some ways
to law I mean there was no legal right
for women to serve on juries until
nineteen seventy five Supreme Court
Jordan well you know the developed among
mostly among women so big crisis inside
the activist movements incidentally in
the 60s when young men who were doing
very courageous things like resistance
had to somehow face the fact that they
too are oppressors
I was difficult acting lead to suicide
in some cases it's a hard thing to deal
with but slowly it spread through much
of the society and now a lot of it's
just taken for granted didn't not
everywhere but no not Rick Santorum but
quite broadly and that's the way things
change and same with workers rights
everything else there's no magic we know
that we know how to do it just a matter
of doing it I live in Venezuela you have
a new message for the people of Latin
America and the Caribbean we're trying
to free themselves from domination by
the United States what's happened in the
last decade south of the border is
pretty spectacular I'm it's of Real
historic importance think over history
for 500 years Latin America was
dominated overwhelmingly but
internationally it was dominated by
imperial powers the first European
powers in the United States internally
it was a reflection of that the typical
Latin American society had a small super
wealth wealthy elite 1% if you like
mostly Europeanized often white there
they concentrated the wealth society
tremendous and misery and oppression in
pretty rich societies societies that
should be quite wealthy the and the
ruling elites were western-oriented I'm
in their capital flowed to the west they
didn't invested at home the the imported
considered luxury goods the children
went to colleges and you know Europe the
United States there at second homes on
the Riviera you know that kind of thing
so they're basically a European
including the u.s. a West net you know
the word for it but in a western implant
inside their own societies ruling it
very early
well and the countries were separated
from one another I didn't have roads
connecting each other they were just
oriented to the west and the u.s. well
that's changed in the last 10 years this
half a millennium pattern is changing
radically other countries beginning to
integrate that's a prerequisite for
independence they've beginning to face
some of their internal problems which
are very severe at doing it in different
ways in different countries but it's
happening throughout the continent the
indigenous movements which are the most
repressed part of the population those
who survived have that again
considerable both organization and even
powered bolivia they run the government
and ecuador their strong part of the
social political order conflicts with
the government but fighting for their
own interest and all of these changes
are very important in fact they may save
the planet around the world whether it's
Australia or Latin America or anywhere
else the indigenous movements are in the
forefront of trying to do something to
save the planet human species from
self-destruction and Bolivia and Ecuador
the two countries with them on strongest
indigenous movement state of theirs now
legislation in Ecuador I think it's in
the Constitution 24 what's go right sin
nature and these are traditional parts
of indigenous culture just totally
marginalized by industrialization and
unless that that consciousness spreads
we're all doomed you know so there's
both for themselves and for the world
some very striking things have happened
it's the u.s. used to take
American completely for granted it was
called the our little region over here
you know which back yet yeah our
backyard you know and it was taken for
granted unless we can control Latin
America can't control the rest of the
world fact that was stated repeatedly
right US has lost it not all of it you
know but South America for example there
isn't a single US military base lifts
which is a pretty significant fact now
the US in giving up the last of the
training of Latin American officers is
increased the be trained to combat
what's called radical populism which
means you know troublesome priests who
organize peasants human rights activists
and so on you know how that works in
Latin America the most interesting cases
right now is Colombia that was the last
holdout for the United States in South
America the US did Bush and Obama tried
to get control of seven boost access to
seven military bases in Colombia now
there's a lot of furor about that on the
continent lot of protest well the call
me in constitutional court Bart blocked
it but the US is still constructing the
basics so they are evidently hoping that
they can somehow overrule the rulings of
the work and then through and there's a
confrontation significant contradiction
going on in Colombia about the legacy of
the u.s. nomination which was pretty
monsters this is Central America and the
Caribbean are much weaker societies and
small small weak separated and there
it's easier than not totally easy
anymore to control them so the coup in
Honduras which the us-backed I'm it
claimed not to back
that effectively ended up acting as I'm
pretty sure is related to the fact that
Honduras is one of the countries where
they're a major US military bases the
Palmer ola air base from one was with
the main base for sporting the Contras
for example and there are basis of their
number American bases US bases spread
all through that region and also in the
Caribbean islands in Dutch islands and
so on but it's it's not direction things
are going so one significant move at
least symbolically was the formation I
think it was last summer finally the
first meeting of in Caracas of the sea
lock the the organization which includes
every country of the Western Hemisphere
except for the United States and Canada
and that's at least symbolically very
significant if it becomes a functioning
organization did its intention i presume
is to replace the OAS or in organization
american states which is us dominated
and it includes cuba excludes the united
states and canada well if all of these
things are in the same direction there
are a move towards dismantling the
system of external control and internal
domination both are proceeding in
parallel and it was very significant
