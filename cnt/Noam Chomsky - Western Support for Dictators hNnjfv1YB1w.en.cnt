and the West has always supported
dictators so take say the Arab Spring up
until the point where the army turned
against the dictators the US Britain and
France supported the dictators I
supported Ben Ali in Tunisia France
supported Mubarak and in Egypt the
leading ally of the United States and
Britain is Saudi Arabia which is the
most extreme Islamic fundamentalist
state a lot the West has nothing against
dictators supports them consistently
what the West is concerned about is
democracy that would be dangerous so the
West will try to adjust what it does to
reduce the threat of democracy and to
try to restore that in the case of the
Arabs or North African states to restore
something like the old regime but with
new names so in Egypt for example the
United States can is reasonably happy
with the Muslim Brotherhood which they
don't care if they have Islamic you know
if the call for Sharia what they care
about is that they accept neoliberal
programs which they do there are
business oriented party which conforms
to us global economic principles and so
they're more or less acceptable and in
fact it takes a certain genius not to
see what's going on because this is a
pattern that is repeated over and over
again there's a kind of a routine game
plan when your favorite dictator is
facing difficulties what you do is
support in to the last minute if it
becomes impossible to support it say if
the army turns against them but the
business class is turned against then
send them off somewhere
get rid of issue passionate statements
about your love of democracy that's the
role of the intellectuals and then try
to restore the old regime it's been done
over and over again so democracy is a
very serious threat in all all over the
world but in the Arab countries - and so
the policies that are taken essentially
we're trying to restore the old regime
as much as possible maybe with new names
you can't do it totally but as much as
possible and that's exactly what you'd
expect it's a traditional policy put
back as far back as history of
imperialism
