I think there's an anarchist in the
long-term you believe that centralized
political power ought to be eliminated
and turned out to the local level so
what role if any would federalism play
in your long term vision of anarchism
general anarchist pictures at least in
the traditional associate myself with or
headed Federalists but there is some
they were based on the notion of
voluntary association so there should be
self-determination in all
institutional's
institutions and structures of life but
voluntary associations could extend to
regions of countries internationally
yeah and that's kind of federalism
supported from below it's a bit of sense
