as you know on saturday december twenty
seven the latest us israeli attack on
hopeless palestinians was launched it
had been meticulously prepared we know
from the Israeli press that both aspects
of the campaign had long been carefully
prepared both the military aspect and
the propaganda aspect learning from the
lessons of the 2006 invasion of Lebanon
which it was argued was not planned well
from a military point of view and was
not advertised properly so this time
both of those aspects were under control
with extensive programs and that means
we can be reasonably confident that
anything that's happening or that is
said is a purposeful it's planned that
way maybe not everything but most of it
one thing that was planned carefully was
the time of the launching of the war was
carefully chosen it was shortly before
noon on Saturday when children are
returning from school and crowds are
milling around in the streets of densely
populated Gaza City and it took only a
few minutes to kill well over 200 people
and wound around 700 which is an
auspicious opening to the mass slaughter
of defenseless civilians trapped in a
tiny cage with nowhere to flee that was
Saturday December 27th last Saturday two
weeks later Israel barred humanitarian
shipments to get
strip because we have to after all honor
the holy days none of this is at all
surprising it's familiar just to mention
one parallel which is relevant come to
it later in june nineteen eighty-two
when Israel launched its us-backed
invasion of Lebanon the first target
attacked was sabra and shatila refugee
camps later to become famous because of
a major massacre the bombing at the
hospital the Gaza hospital killed more
than 200 people that was the opening day
of the invasion which killed maybe 15 to
20,000 people destroyed much of southern
Lebanon which parts of Beirut it was
able to proceed as usual because of us
support the u.s. authorization us arms
diplomatic support which included
vetoing a series of Security Council
resolutions calling for an end to the
carnage the aggression was undertaken
also as usual and as conceded in fact to
defend Israel namely from the threat of
a peaceful political settlement that's
contrary to much routine deceit in the
United States particularly but it's all
so well documented it's hardly necessary
to talk about it oh this is normal and
it's not concealed by high Israeli
officials just give one example 30 years
ago the chief of staff of the army more
fagor pointed out that quote him since
nineteen forty eight we have been
fighting against a population that lives
in villages and cities israel's major
military analyst
save ship summarized his remarks it said
the Israeli army has always struck
civilian populations purposely
unconsciously the army guru said has
never distinguished civilian from
military targets but has purposely
attacked civilian targets and the
reasons were explained at the same time
by the distinguished statesmen of ebon
considered dove he said there was a
rational prospect ultimately fulfilled
that affected populations would exert
pressure for the cessation of
hostilities satisfying Israel's goals
haven't happened to be commenting on a
speech by Menachem bagan which presented
a picture eben said of an Israel
wantonly inflicting every possible
measure of death and anguish on civilian
populations in a mood reminiscent of
regimes which neither mr. Vega nor I
would dare to mention by name Evan did
not contest the facts he criticized
beggin for speaking about them so
frankly which could be harmful these
early image his own views which I just
quoted could also be attributed to
countries that we dare not mentioned by
name well as the latest US Israeli
assault on Gaza began a small boat the
dignity was traveling from Cyprus to
Lebanon there were doctors and human
rights activists award and they intended
to violate Israel's criminal blockade
and to bring supplies to the trapped
population the boat was intercepted far
out at sea in international waters of
the Israeli Navy rammed it without
warnings really damaged the boat it
managed to limp to a Lebanese Harbor
provided the routine lies terrorists etc
and claimed that the boat wasn't around
but unfortunately for the propaganda
system there were respected journalists
on board including CNN correspondent
Karl Penhaul who reported the rather al
Jazeera reporters but Penhall is hard to
dismiss though he was dismissed also a
board where it was cynthia mckinney the
former representative a candidate
presidential candidate for the Green
Party she and other passengers verified
call pin holes account which I've just
stated this is all quite a serious crime
for example a ramp ramming and almost
thinking about in international waters
is a much more serious crime than piracy
off the coasts of Somalia for example it
received very little notice a few words
here and there it's which reflects a
tassantassuk acceptance of the principle
that Israel is authorized to carry out
crimes on the high seas in order to
defend itself against any interference
with its illegal military occupation by
trying to provide some sucker to the
victims also tacitly accepted is that
the Gaza Strip isn't is occupied
territory that is Israel has a right to
impose a siege on it well that lack of
attention again makes good sense it's
all very familiar for decades Israel has
been hijacking ships in international
waters between cypress and Lebanon
killing passengers kidnapping them many
of them brought the Israel some held as
hostages for a long time in prison
sometimes in the secret prison torture
chambers we
they've been exposed in Israel in Europe
but not reported here and it's none
occasionally see a mention of it in u.s.
commentary but never considered very
serious so there's no particular reason
why this new crime should be greeted
with anything more than a yawn these
regular practices are quite significant
they underscore the utter hypocrisy of
the standard claim that Israel had the
right to invade Lebanon once again in
2006 fifth invasion because soldiers
were captured at the border actually as
I say this has been Israeli practice
over many years has been far more
extreme killing intercepting ships
killing people air capturing them as
hostages oh that is far more extreme
crime than capturing soldiers out of
order most think what you do about that
but it doesn't rank anywhere near it so
if that justifies the invasion which
again once again devastated southern
Lebanon parts of Beirut if principles
operated you can draw your own
conclusions but fortunately they don't
operate fortunately fortunately for the
US and its clients
