I think you've already kind of touched
upon this but over the course of your
illustrious career have world affairs
being become increasingly familiar other
Estill areas that seem alien to you
about areas that can still shock and
surprise take Twitter for example Oh
totally area to me I'm not gonna get
near it all right it's a kind of
depressing question because the answer
is virtually everything I mean even in
the fields in which I've worked all my
life say professionally the more you
learn the less you've the more you
realize the less you know I mean as you
what happens is standard in the sciences
but everywhere else too you know you you
look you you learn more you think you're
approaching some kind of a horizon but
in fact the horizon is receding and the
more you learn the more you see that
horizon is very far away that's true and
I could give you examples from my own
field but it's true in the core Sciences
now it takes a physics you know the star
of the sciences and they got some
problems like one problem is they can't
find 90% of the mass energy in the
universe it's it's postulated because
otherwise nothing works but can't find
it can't find any evidence that is there
there's pretty serious problem I
remember about 10 years ago this one was
finally overcome about ten years ago the
big the Hubble telescope which is out in
space it was bringing in tons of
information about outer space and there
was a time when it turned out that the
that had very powerful evidence that the
universe was considerably younger than
its oldest stars that's pretty serious
problem the and anyway in any field you
are that's what you find all the time
when you turn to human affair
you know our understanding is extremely
thin almost everything is you're
learning all the time from other people
from you know your children your friends
your enemies so depths of human
possibilities and capacities that we can
barely perceive when you look at
different fields I mean sometimes one of
them having a boring interview on the
telephone and I'm trying to think about
something else because the questions are
too boring I start looking around the
room where I work you know full of books
piled up to the sky and so and I all
different kinds of topics and then start
calculating how many centuries would I
have to live reading 24 hours a day
every day of the week to make a dent in
what I'd like to learn about things it's
pretty depressing so the answer to the
question I think is you know we have
little bits of understanding glimpses a
little bit of light here and there but a
tremendous amount of darkness which is a
challenge you know it being life to be
pretty boring if we understood
everything better if we don't understand
anything and know that we don't that's
the important part
