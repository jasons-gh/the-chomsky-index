efforts made to prevent that they
continue at this moment one major effort
was the establishment of NATO its
official purpose was to protect Europe
from Russian hordes but a major purpose
was to ensure that Europe would stay
under us control that's a very lie this
year today that concern NATO impacted
and has expanded its role was expanded
I'll come back to that expanded again
this morning in fact if you read this
morning's newspapers but this conception
of Europe is a potential independent
force is tempered by a certain degree of
contempt just a few days ago the ahead
of the Council on Foreign Relations
Richard Haass as long government service
wrote an article called goodbye Europe
it was saying well Europe has lost its
role as a high-ranking power the main
reason is it's not violent enough the
Europe has lost its traditional
understanding of the values of brutality
in conquest and savagery it's now too
peaceful and it's not an appropriate
partner so goodbye Europe you're not
fulfilling your role well the we then
move into what's called the Cold War
period again there's doctrine then
there's fact the doctrine about the Cold
War you know we learn more about its
reality from the actual events the
actual events of the Cold War were the
US intervention and subversion
throughout the Grand area the region of
us control that's most of the world and
the justification for the intervention
and subversion that was the Cold War we
have to defend ourselves from the
Russians and Russia was pretty much the
same it's much smaller domains from the
Russian point of view the cold
or was the actual ax ax of the Cold War
were intervention and subversion and
control within its eastern european
domains so in reality the Cold War was a
kind of a tacit compact between the two
superpowers that they would act freely
without too much disturbance from the
other in their own domains but would
leave each other alone that didn't
always work but that came very close to
a global war during the Cuban Missile
Crisis but that was a leading principle
now within us domains the main concern
was what is officially called the domino
theory it might more accurately be
called the Mafia principle the
International Affairs is very much like
the Mafia The Godfather man in charge
does not accept disobedience
disobedience is much too dangerous even
the smallest storekeeper cannot refuse
to pay protection money and it has to be
smashed and destroyed so that others
don't get the idea that they can get
away with it too you are maintained
discipline you have to ensure that
disobedience is not tolerated even in
the smallest place and that's a major
team of international affairs right
until the present actually Iran is
against again in an analogy why is Iran
considered such a major threat well we
can read in official u.s. documents it's
a threat because it's it first of all it
could become a deterrent to us action
the freedom of us action the US must be
free to invade other countries to
overthrow governments and so on and Iran
if it becomes independent especially if
it's a nuclear deterrent that could be a
deterrent to this man a deterrent is
unacceptable disobedience of course the
fact that Iran overthrew the u.s.
imposed government is except already
unacceptable disobedient
the other charge against Iran is that
it's attempting to extend its influence
to neighboring countries so it's
attempting to extend its influence in
Iraq and Afghanistan maybe elsewhere and
that's intolerable the United States
isn't interfering when it invades those
countries it's protecting them that's a
principle of empire so the US doesn't
interfere intervene anywhere but if Iran
tries to extend its influence to its
neighbors that's aggression unacceptable
interference again a typical theme of
Imperial policy very striking and the US
policy for the last half century well
meanwhile as i said the grand areas
become were diversified became tri-polar
today it's diversifying even more Latin
America for the first time in its
history is moving towards a degree of
Independence relations south-south
relations are being established so for
example China is now the mating major
trading partner of Brazil the most
important country in South America
that's Lou more generally this very
common talk these days about a shift of
power the global shift of power with
China and India becoming the rising
world powers maybe Brazil on the side
and so on if I were true if China and
India didn't become the Centers of world
power that would be a return to the days
prior to European imperialism back to
say the 17th century when they were
indeed the industrial and commercial
centers of the world it's not a very
accurate picture there is a shift of
power but it's not between states really
does shift of power from the global
workforce to transnational capital and
it includes it goes worldwide that china
is part of it China is basically a huge
assembly plant
using very cheap labor for a Asian
production system so the the parts and
components and high technology move into
China from the more advanced industrial
societies Japan South Korea Taiwan
particularly that they're assembled in
China then exported mainly to the United
States also to Europe the American
producers are doing the same things
major computer companies and so on will
shift their production to China to use
the cheap labor force the horrible
working conditions and so on then export
back to the United States
US economy because they hold so much
debt so much of the u.s. debt well
actually the biggest holder review as
dead as Japan and that doesn't give them
any leverage in world affairs because
it's not a powerful instrument the trade
deficit with China is huge but again
that's a that's an economist kind of
construction of the trade deficit with
China has gone up but the trade deficit
with Japan and South Korea and Taiwan
has gone down and the reason is because
China the those countries and Singapore
export to China the advanced parts and
components of technology which are then
assembled in china sent to the United
States and counted as Chinese exports
but if you look at the actual
contribution scopa value added in the
exports it's mostly from the peripheral
regions in fact the economists have
calculated that if we did it an accurate
accounting of the trade deficit the
trade deficit with China would go down
maybe twenty-five or thirty percent and
it would rise to Japan and South Korea
and Taiwan so we have as a major
production there is a major production
center with an assembly plant in the
middle of it called China but the
producers from Asia and the outside are
providing the more advanced the
components of this as our that producers
in the United States and to a lesser
extent Europe well that's a that's a
significant change the end globally the
percentage of income were a wealth that
goes to the workforce is declining
almost everywhere in fact it's declining
in China and were rapidly than most
other places on the other hand wealth is
being heavily concentrated
internationally in transnational capital
well that's a it's an old story it's not
the first time it's happening it's take
taking
forms and it's being accelerated by the
international trade agreements the
international trade agreement for trade
agreements but that's a misnomer that's
not what they are they really invest
your right agreement
