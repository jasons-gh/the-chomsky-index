okay it's theirs to be recording great
so I'm here with Noam Chomsky Noam
thanks very much for joining me today
glad to be with you so I wanted to talk
to you especially about climate change
but before we go into that I kind of
wanted to address some recent events
this is going to air this this podcast
can air in a couple weeks but today is
January 13th and was only about 10 days
ago that the u.s. assassinated the top
Iranian general Soleimani there was a
lot of debate on cable news over whether
we should call this guy a terrorist or
not or what happened an assassination
what kinds of questions do you think a
free press should be asking about these
events well the first twisting their
should be asking is how they would react
if Iran were to assassinate the top US
general second-highest figure in the US
government
in Mexico City Airport also killing the
commander of a large part of the army
that the u.s. supports have been allied
state how would they react you know had
they reacted
they'd be calling for a major attack
against Iran devastating retaliation for
this act of international terrorism so
then the next question that you should
ask is why aren't they saying that is
there such a thing as a free presence or
is the press just an agent of the
government that's what they should be
it's been a particularly eerie beginning
to the new neck new decade not just this
business with Iran but also the fires in
Australia which is probably a good segue
to climate
and I know you've said recently and I
should add the qualification that you
give as well when you make this
statement that you believe the
Republican Party is the most dangerous
organization in human history
and you add that you know that's an
outrageous statement but could you could
you elaborate on that what why do you
say that let's go back to the first
power of negotiations the goal of the of
the Paris negotiations was to reach a
treaty in which countries would commit
themselves to specific reductions in
emissions and it would be the verifiable
census international treaty that
couldn't be done for one reason the
Republican Party would not agree to
allow that to happen so what happened
instead was it a just a set of promises
without any not carrying any force which
is much less less significant of course
the subsequent that international
meetings tried to enforce these
regulations they were constantly blocked
by the United States under the pressure
of the Republican Party the latest ones
in Madrid of the u.s. at a presence that
the sole role of the US presence listed
to try to prevent anything from
happening whether it's eight other
countries fixed commitments to the
missions whatever it might be which were
in addition to the head to being the
only country the only major country in
the world that is refusing to take any
steps to deal with this urgent crisis
the Republican Party is dedicated openly
and publicly to try to maximize the
threat to use the maximum
the maximum possible use of fossil fuels
that to cut back on even domestic
regulations that would just for the
benefit of the population of the United
States so just a couple of days ago
President Donald Trump they issued an
executive order probably illegal as the
courts will determine but he issued an
executive order to essentially dismantle
the major environmental protection
legislation with respect for 50 years to
Richard Nixon's to monitor and control
the poisonous substances that going into
the water supply many other such
conditions the idea is to maximize the
coming destruction and to harm the
populations in the United States as much
as possible sounds strong just take a
look at this the legislation and it's
very interesting to see the thinking
mind so the National Transportation
Authority got a year ago published what
in my mind is one of the astonish most
astonishing documents in human history
literally it's an environmental
assessment careful environmental
assessment couple hundred pages
concludes that by the end of the century
temperatures will is risen four degrees
that agree anyone who follows this modes
that the scientific community the World
Bank describes such a temperature rise
over pre-industrial levels as Cataclysm
as basically the end over twice as high
as the maximum level they think is
possible for organizing human life and
after having her on this conclusion can
illusion this is said that made this
assessment they draw a conclusion
conclusion is we should put no further
restrictions one emissions automotive
emissions they don't give the reasoning
but I guess you can imagine me that
we're going off the cliff anyway
I so why not have a good time I can't
think of another interpretation except
maybe Jenny well some of us if you can
find a document like that in history I'd
be interested in seeing but I mean what
comes to mind maybe is the bonzi the
Declaration of Nazi Germany 1942
deciding to murder all the Jews killed
30 minutes love pretty awful but not
saying let's destroy it will organize
human life on earth which is what the
same thing you have to remember that
pretty close to it the level of global
warming of about 125,000 years ago when
sea levels were about six to nine meters
higher than they are today
try to imagine a world in which that's
the case let alone the acceleration of
the mass acceleration of what's going on
in Australia extraordinary with the
drought huge droughts they're causing
enormous problems all over the world
India with temperatures reaching the
fifty degree centigrade last summer and
the Rajasthan amis I think what this
means for much of the world I mean it's
it's just no words to capture so it's
the most dangerous organization in human
history it's a pretty credible statement
and it's kind of interesting to see how
this happened
know a lot about it if you feel back 10
years 2008 of the Republican Party was
beginning to move towards steps to try
to deal somehow with global warming they
were toying with the carbon tax cap and
trade so on John McCain ran for the
presidency and on the Republican ticket
in 2008 with a part of his platform was
efforts to deal with the threat of
global warming what happened the Koch
brothers new generation corporation had
been working very hard to try to get the
Republican Party to be denialist to deny
that global warming is happening went
into high gear they launched a Duggar
juggernaut under the leadership of David
children deceased bribing senators
intimidating them developing fake
grassroots organizations which would
lobbying they turned the party around
that was enough to turn the entire party
into basically denialists it was
interesting to look at the 2016 the last
2016 primary during the primary which
was the cream of the crop of the
Republican Party every single proposed
candidate either denied that what is
happening is happening there it doesn't
matter the moderate Jeb Bush favored the
establishment he said well maybe global
warming is happening but we don't do
anything
well the most remarkable was on Kasich
the Governor of Ohio who was regarded as
the adult in the room the sensible per
person to moderate to be possibly
elected he said global warming is
definitely happening serious but we in
Ohio are gonna keep producing coal and
we're not going to apologize for that's
the worst of all it's like for the labor
minister in Australia opposition party
who's right in the middle of the what's
happening with the continent burning
down is visiting the coal mines to
explain that we have to increase our
production and export of coal and that's
quite consistent with our policies is
preserving the environment hard to find
words to describe behavior of this kind
quartz trunk was it was fun you know he
just lay out on the extremist end of the
list but notice it's the whole forty
forty which by now opens lock stock and
barrel no one else dares with daring to
say a word and criticism of him because
they don't want to bridge the adoring
please I'm fine
that's all right today record Trump is
the greatest president in American
history Lincoln and it goes beyond this
it might come pay of the Secretary of
State alleged to be the serious person
in the administration that he suggested
that God sent Trump to the United States
to protect Israel from the rent we're
living in a world of raving lunatics
with enormous power
our destroyers which they're using what
about the fact that you mentioned India
but countries that are developing and
lifting themselves out of poverty like
India and China as they go through the
process of development they tend to
pollute more and contribute more to
climate change you've spoken of how the
Republican Party's blocked action in the
US but do we in the West really have the
authority morally or politically to tell
developing countries not to use cheap
fossil fuels to improve their standard
of living we have the moral
responsibility and the capacity to
assist them in getting off fossil fuels
one of the elements with the cup
negotiations since powers is to fund
developing countries to help them move
towards renewable energy that's what the
u.s. meaning the Republican Party
systematically blocks once again a
couple of weeks ago in Madrid so we have
and there this can be done on large
scale and small scale so take India
India is becoming so hot over the summer
that it's barely livable and people if
they can afford it
are trying to get air conditioners well
it's a poor country so that they are
getting cheap air conditioners which are
highly polluting that how much would it
cost the West to provide in the air with
up-to-date non polluting air
conditioners and it wouldn't even be
statistical error in the budget but we
can't do it now the fact of the matter
is that these countries are taking steps
India is in fact taking some steps
different steps to move towards
energy and China's doing more than
anyone they're still the largest
polluter but they're taking steps beyond
any other country to try to overcome
this China's produces more electric cars
and I think the rest of the world from
behind its way in the lead in developing
sophisticated mass-produced solar energy
and wind turbines and interestingly the
United States which is the major danger
after the world is trying to impede
Chinese development one of the charges
against a lot of charges against China
the one of them is that they have an
industrial policy so which among other
things is moving very ambitious but to
deal with the threat of climate change
we've got a terrain to stop that because
that allegedly violates her sacred free
trade principles which of course we
violated all the time the reason you in
Ohio
able to do what we're doing now is
because of us industrial policy than the
fifties and since which developed the
technology for the high-tech economy the
through state and massive state
intervention all the way through this
story goes way back in history but we
have to impede Chinese industrial
development that's very important
including their leadership in renewable
energy and their efforts to try to
expand it I mean somebody looking at
this from outer space we think this
species is just insane what do you think
the issue of climate I don't know if
you've paid attention to the Democratic
debates at all but it's it's come up
there a few times and I mean some of the
questions that do get asked are so
trivial
I believe Greta turn berg is now
advocating for media outlets
refused advertising dollars from fossil
fuel companies do you think that would
make much of a difference in terms of
the coverage that climate change
receives probably not unfortunately for
one thing - the same I mean that could
only happen first of all if there was a
serious understanding of the urgency and
scale of this threat without that it
wouldn't happen and if you had that
understanding you wouldn't need I mean
the fact of the matter is there should
be the screaming headline every day in
the mainstream press about the fact that
we're going off a cliff and we're not
doing much about Athan burgers trying to
get them to say I mean after you
probably listened to her talk at the
25-minute talk very eloquent very
accurate lots of details exactly very
well said
but what can you say about a world in
which the sixteen-year-old kid has to
lecture great figures of the world on
their failure to address a threat that
within not very long it's gonna
undermine organized human life we have
to listen to the 16 year old kid tells
me yeah it's um there has been in the
past decade a global rise of the far
right and it comes to just about the
worst possible time during this what's
deemed a make-or-break decade for
climate change the El Paso killer the
the white nationalist who wrote a
manifesto before the shooting mentioned
environmental catastrophe and this has
come up among a lot of far-right figures
now and they're worried about
mass migration they have slogans like
you know save bees not refugees are you
worried at all that if we don't do
anything there could be some kind of
rise of what's sometimes called eco
fascism I mean I said there's plenty to
worry about about the far right but I
don't think this is a no-go
not as much more to worry about about
the mainstream now what you said before
about the Democratic debates which
incidentally I I'll admit I don't watch
what I read about them which is that is
quite accurate I mean they're focused on
impeachment for the crime of having the
president and having tried to harm the
leading figure in the Democratic Party
that's the focus of the impeachment that
he that Trump used his office to try to
get another the government Ukraine to
find harmful material about leading
candidate democratic authority that's
the issue the big issue in the world
incidentally does that remind you of
something do you recall an event called
Watergate sure was Richard Nixon charged
with well there were efforts by several
congressmen one wasn't rubber treinen
priest from massachusetts to include in
the articles of impeachment some of
Nixon's crimes the lake for the bombing
of Cambodia for example which was
horrifying wall knocked out the only
issue that was left was that Nixon sent
some petty thugs to break into the
Democratic Party that's the big issue
with Richard Nixon big issue with Donald
Trump is going after Trebek party
candidate and there that's the lead
issue that the Democrats
focusing them right which incidentally
will almost certainly turn into a gift
to trunk you can predict senators
obviously exactly Drayton ill parade as
with a triumph we the people finally
managed to undermine and the deep state
the traitors are trying to destroy the
presidency I could make up the
propaganda easily so it's very much like
the imelda report it's predictably and
predicted was motivating if the trunk
so is this that's what you focus on
not his edit not his policies on global
warming which are gonna destroy that we
barely Nord and the pressures will
occasionally if it's kind of interesting
to watch to read the coverage and the
best newspapers in the world you got
four times at London's financial time
and really serious newspapers just take
a look at their coverage of the fossil
fuel emmissions euphoric the United
States just passed Saudi Arabia and
reducing fossil fuels that's great now
we have energy independence well we
don't have other countries impeding our
policies the fossil fuel industry is
investing more and profitable fossil
fuel extraction long detailed articles
try to find the word global warming
those articles I mean sometimes you read
about environmental problems so long
article in The New York Times but their
best correspondents to different
problems
Trump's expansion of the fossil fuel
exploration United States and there is a
mention of environmental problem at one
point he says that more drilling and
what they own
for fossil fuels may harm the local
ranchers the whose water supply may be
affected Mike is that the big problem I
mean it doesn't they will know about it
it's not as if there's any lack of
knowledge just as the CEOs of the big
banks know as much as we do about the
threat of global warming while they pour
funds that do fossil fuel extraction
including the most dangerous resonant
rcent this is if some kind of
schizophrenic I'm gonna do one hand we
know that we're destroying the
possibilities for human life and then
the other has our brain we can make some
more money tomorrow
again it's pretty hard to find words to
describe these yeah it's it's almost
like a drug addict knowing that what
they're doing is killing their body but
they just can't stop you've talked about
the the stakes of this election are you
someone who's worried I mean I know I
don't want to put you in the prediction
business but are you worried at all if
we nominate a centrist like Biden or
Buddha judge that that just sort of
could be a 2016 election do-over and
reelect Trump well I think it's
imperative in this election the Trump
almost anybody first guy I meet on the
street reelected we know what's gonna
happen there will be an acceleration of
the kinds of destructive and threatening
programs to which he is committed may be
worse because the second term the
president usually he's an option to be
more free and what they do there's no
indication this is going to change
incidentally it's not only global warm
there's something else that nobody's
talking about
well most it's just a series and that's
the dismantling of the arms control
regime the threat of nuclear war is
quite serious and that's really
essentially permanent the country that
carries out a first strike in a major
nuclear war will itself be destroyed
simply by the effects of nuclear winter
and that's coming closer now there were
there was a series of treaties which
somewhat reduced the threat of nuclear
war which has always been extremely I
may look at the record it's kind of
miraculous at meat escape but there were
some treaties that reduce the threat one
was the ABM Treaty that was dismantled
by George W Bush second is the INF
treaty for which a banned short-range
nuclear missiles in Europe very
significant that was signed by Reagan
and Gorbachev in 1987 that's just been
dismantled by the u.s. got by Trump in
ministry just last August time did very
nicely day or two before Hiroshima day
and plainly they'd been planning this
done of course been planning it but very
strikingly right after about dismantle
dismantling the treaty the Pentagon
launched a missile which why they did
the treaty
virtually pleading with others come
along and find ways to destroy us we've
opened the door another the next one on
the table is the Open Skies treaty
initiated by that terrible left-wing
radical Dwight Eisenhower that's going
to go
let's reduced the threat that one of the
major powers rushing the United States
would misunderstand what's having
launched missiles now the last one is
the New START treaty 21 drop
administration's already indicated yeah
I'm saying that in fact the preparatory
steps to do so haven't been taken that
ends the arms control regime essentially
and it says let's develop the most
destructive weapons that we possibly can
and be happy about the factory destroy
ourselves some people are happy about
this you can read the literature of the
arms the arms in the district military
industry they're delighted you're
ecstatic getting huge contracts to
develop weapons to destroy everything
also thinking that little way down the
road they'll get even bigger contracts
to try to figure out ways to defend
against the monstrous
weapons that they're developing now so
it's just a perfect world that's just a
serious global warming and there's
virtually not a word this is not just my
opinion it's one so take William Terry
former Secretary of Defense leading
specialist on nuclear weapons ability to
life to it and a pretty conservative guy
not given to federated rhetoric he says
he's not only terrified he's doubly
terrified one by the growing threat to
[Laughter]
[Music]
the it's interesting you mentioned that
because I know during the later years of
the Obama administration they approved
some nuclear modernization program that
would have cost a few trillion dollars
just under the pressure of was there too
sometimes when I've brought that up with
people they say you know oh well we also
had really old computer systems on the
nuclear weapons and this actually made
things more safe is that is that a
legitimate argument you should take a
look at the record I mean there's been a
case after case we're failure of the
automated systems virtually the Dewar
when it came within minutes of launching
weapon the terminal war and when human
intervention so for example in 1979
national security adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski was just about picking up the
phone to call President Carter to tell
him that were under a terrible missile
attack when information came in saying
was a technical error actually this goes
back to the first establishment of this
system back under Eisenhower the first
soon it was immediately it was a 99%
probability of the terribly Russian
missile attack literally a miracle one
of the things I did make sure to want to
make sure that I asked you about
a lot of these issues we've been talking
about in many ways seem to fall back to
a lack of accountability for especially
people in power and really does seem
like when you get to a certain level of
wealth and power that you're really just
not going to face the kind of
consequences that ordinary people would
face and one of the cases recently that
has really underscored that phenomenon
in a dramatic way was the case of
Jeffrey Epstein and I only ask you
because he was vaguely affiliated with
MIT where you had talked for many years
and he had donated to the Media Lab
interacted with top scientists and
intellectuals and this is after his
first conviction which the MIT Media Lab
knew about conviction but also after his
serving instant there's a principle of
Western law that once person has served
the sentence he's the same as everybody
else hmm seems to be forgotten there's
some other interesting questions Jeffrey
Epstein gave and a million dollars to
MIT is he the worst person who's
contributed to MIT in my office at MIT
when I was there not there anymore I
looked at the window was my office and I
saw the David Koch Cancer Center David
Koch can it's surely a candidate from
one of the most extraordinary criminals
in human history correctly but he did he
was personally responsible for shifting
the Republican Party for being a
moderately saying minimally to being the
most dangerous organization in human
history which may destroy us all is that
serious pretty serious does anybody say
anything about that
let's take a look when David Cook mr.
president produced
laudatory intro Mia he's one of the
model MIT graduates he did such
wonderful things from MIT now he even
funded the basketball team just striking
a strange abilities well there's
certainly hypocrisy there I'm sorry I
don't know if the bunkers he's a great
word I mean think about what why this
obsession but not much more significant
well the only reason why it was
intriguing to me was the fact that
Alexander Acosta the labor secretary and
the prosecutor who had given him what
people regarded as a lenient sentence
said that he was told he belonged to
intelligence by just fair enough but
then the criminal is accosted sure not
not the not the person who is that is
that something worth exploring or I know
you have a deep well knowledge about the
intelligence services is that the idea
that they could be having some sort of
sting operation with some guy involved
is that just crazy talk or is that
something that could happen I mean I
haven't followed it closely do a lot of
strange things about the alleged Susan
just a couple of days ago a report came
out saying that the cameras were off and
the backup cameras were off
day after day some very strange things
come right and there's there's no real
way of answering that question at least
right now with the information we have
the last question I wanted to ask you
Bertrand Russell who I understand is
well-regarded in your eyes was once
asked suppose this film was going to be
looked at by our descendants in a
thousand years time would you think it's
worth it to tell that generation I know
you're not one for grand statements or
anything like that but you want to take
a stab at that question well you sure I
would tell them if you're alive and
hearing this it's a miracle because
you're not so remote ancestors we're
acting in a way which was condemning you
and everyone else to this well on that
on that note no thank you very much for
your time the real pleasure
deductive sorry we couldn't be faced
types hey no worries
and again I'll stop this recording but
