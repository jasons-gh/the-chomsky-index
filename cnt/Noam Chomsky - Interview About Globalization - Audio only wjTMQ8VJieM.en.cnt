do you have mr. Chomsky in line yes good
morning mr. Chomsky hi good how you
doing uh going fine listen how should I
address you professor Chomsky mr.
Chomsky Noam whatever on the turn
alright thank you very much no I
appreciate you really being on the show
this morning it is quite an honor to
have you on and I'll tell you you know
when I was doing research I didn't even
know where to start because you've
written so much that it covers such a
wide variety of topics obviously if
you're studying language and foreign
policy that's going to encompass almost
everything but I wanted to make a couple
comments about some of the people we've
had on the show just recently and some
of the statements they've made and I'm
gonna be paraphrasing these people one
of them is somebody that you mentioned
in the most recent book that you and
David Barr Samian are have collaborated
and the propaganda in the public mind
Dean Baker of the Center for Economic
Policy and research said that the
Clinton Bush corporate model of
globalization is not about free trade
and I would even add that Bush is
constantly being compared to the Reagan
free trade market based economy are any
of these people or interests really
about free trade well Dean Baker knows
what he's talking about and I take him
very seriously he's a first-rate
economist it's a mixture this is sort of
what's called neoliberal neoliberal
globalization if you take a look close
look at it it's a complicated mixture of
liberalisation you know free trade and
protectionism high protectionism with
all sorts of you know modified and
finessed and all kinds of ways to ensure
that major concentrations of private
power unaccountable private power gain
dominance over domestic policy and
international policy now there are
elements of free trade in it but there
are also many other elements so for
example I'm sure Baker talked about this
but the a so-called trip's system in an
intellectual protection of intellectual
property that's a highly protectionist
system without historical precedent
that was imposed on the rest of the
world by the rich countries in the what
came to be the World Trade Organization
it imposes extremely rigid conditions on
control over the technology and
knowledge of the future the conditions
that today's rich countries like the
United States never accepted while they
were developing but are now being
imposed on the rest well that's super
protectionism or just for example
there's something called a national
security exemption which allows
government expenditures well in the
United States for and most other
industrial countries but it's extreme
here for the last 50 years national
defense is just a kind of a Orwellian
term referring to massive public
subsidies to cover the risk and cost of
the development of new advanced
technology I that's nothin about free
trade there we wouldn't have a what's
called the new economy if it wasn't for
the way in which it costs and risks were
essentially socialized the public pays
for them that's another violation and
there's all sorts of other gimmickry on
the other hand that there's and some of
what's called free trade then they have
anything do straight for example the
conditions on financial liberalisation
you know good one of the things that the
system of the past 20 25 years has done
is eliminate earlier constraints that
governments could impose on capital flow
in flight of capital modalities of
investment absorbed
well that's eliminated but captain
movements capital it's not trade and
it's the best coming up is even more
extreme one of the major issues coming
up it's kind of being negotiated pretty
quietly because I don't think they want
people to understand the consequences of
it but right now there's current
negotiations
what's called trade and services going
on in Geneva this was a big issue at
Quebec also at the last April of a new
fruit so-called free trade area of the
Americas supposed to have strong
elements of liberalization of trade and
services what our services our services
covers just about anything that might be
in the public arena
so education health control over water
by our mental conditions you name it
anything that might be subject to public
involvement what they call governments
which means people to the extent that
governments are democratic anything that
might be under popular in
decision-making in control that's pretty
much covers with services or
liberalisation of service services which
has nothing to do with trade is it means
let's work out ways for those things to
be taken over by private power
concentrations by multinational
corporations which are unaccountable to
the public a work in secret are
essentially tyrannies internally and
let's do that
claiming that we're liberalizing trade
you know this is simply a way of
undermining democracy there's nothing to
do with trade so I suspect Dean Baker
probably talked about all these things
but you know those are some of the
aspects of what's called free trade I
mean you know Adam Smith certainly
wouldn't recognized it in fact if you go
back to classical free trade doctrine
say Adam Smith it was based crucially on
what Smith called the free distribution
of labor
meaning labor can go anywhere well there
was to some extent true in the 19th
century when there were massive
population movements across borders but
certainly not true now people can't go
in capital can go anywhere but people
can't now that's almost the opposite of
classical free trade theory I'm four
days
Adam Smith and David Ricardo and so on
it was taken for classical classical
economics it was assumed that capital is
immobile and people are mobile that's
what the whole theory of comparative
advantage and everything else is based
on and the benefits of free trade based
on those assumptions
well now the facts are wrong as the
opposite a capital is mobile Labor's
immobile that fact alone gives major
advantages to capital in conflicts
between concentrated private power and
the mass of the population working
people shifts the balance and this is
all so I've been posed under the rubric
of free trade which sounds like a nice
word but and that is often but it's
become a highly intricate concept which
is simply a form of class warfare
basically also in your in the newest
book propaganda in the public mind you
state that it's always well you commend
people for asking the obvious questions
and so I'll be asking obvious questions
this morning and hopefully get a
commendation from you one of the things
that I've heard people who are
neoliberal or maybe even a better term
for it is conservative or whatever label
you know those are so nebulous I really
don't even know what those words mean
anymore is that is that empty Prout
critics and protesters of version for
instance the free trade area of the
Americas or the WTO hearings or
ministerial hearings or whatever
globalization agreement hearings that
are going on they always say that well
you know business has to be represented
because these are about business and
trade and those people know the best
about what to do with business and trade
and the people should be represented and
those and the people are represented by
their elected officials so so having
protesters and critics say that that it
is not a democracy because in fact the
people are being represented by our US
Trade Representative anoles the fact
that there
you know that the that is not a
democratic process how would you respond
to that
why don't you kind of take a poll on the
streets of Chicago and ask who knows how
many people know who the US Trade
Representative is or one thing that the
Trade Representative is committed to
these are negotiations these are
policies undertaken in secret the
negotiations are essentially in secret
the results are secretive there are
among trade ministers of government
that's true but the relation between the
trade ministers and the population the
executive branch and the population is
certainly putting begin to resemble
democracy the in fact and it's well
understood I mean it's for example The
Wall Street Journal while back I was
lamenting the fact that it's hard to
pass these procedures that keep that
insulate trade agreements from popular
pressure it's very hard to pass them
because public doesn't like them and
they said the problem is that opponents
of these measures have what they called
an ultimate weapon the ultimate weapon
is that the population is opposed so
therefore you have to somehow do it in
secret behind their backs
since naturally we have to do it all
right when you say that the government's
under the United States about is
democratic is any society around on the
other hand about 75 percent XA the last
election roughly 75 percent of the
population before the election not after
the Florida shenanigans but right on the
eve of the election about three-quarters
of the population felt that the election
had nothing to do with them it was some
kind of game being played by rich
Investor's
rich contributors political leaders the
public relations industry which was
crafting candidates to come out with
words that they thought might fuel the
people and so on now if three-quarters
of the population thinks an election is
even going on what are we talking about
when we say that the negotiations being
carried out and in secret by people
no one ever heard of represent the
public will I mean
business isn't mislead about that they
know that the public is an ultimate
weapon Wall Street Journal terms against
what they're carrying out which is
exactly why it has to be done in secret
so for example at the that they freed
the the summit of the Americas last
April was a good example all right this
big Beck meetings it was discussing the
free trade area of the Americas
how much discussion had there been in
the in public say in the press about
what the free trade area of the Americas
is how many people even know that it
existed this has been under negotiation
for years but it's kept out of the
public eye people can discover something
about if they really work you get
involved in the activists activists
networks and you interchange over the
Internet and so on yeah you can figure
out something about what's going on you
listen to Dean Baker and people like
that you can find out what's going on
but you know that's a minuscule part of
the population that's not freedom and
democracy and even at the meetings while
the the leaders of the government came
out with a ringing statement about how
wonderful democracy is that you can tell
how well they how much they meant it by
asking what happened there for example
if it's if they're so committed to
democracy how come not telling us what
the negotiations on trade and services
are about core issue what were they
telling us if it's democracy or to take
something even more straightforward at
those meetings is last April right time
just to appear with recall at the George
Bush every time he talked was talking
about how wonderful NASPA is we have to
extend the marvels of the master to the
rest of the hemisphere well right at
that time every news desk in the country
had on it a two major reports that had
come out by very respectable and
well-known organizations that one is
Human Rights Watch made
human rights organization or the other
the Economic Policy Institute research
institution in Washington that does some
of the basic work on the the data of
what's going on in the country the
economic data there are two major
reports both about NAFTA both time for
the onset of the meetings Human Rights
Watch filling its mandate was concerned
with rights labor rights what's been the
effect of NAFTA on labor rights I gave a
detailed report showing and convincingly
I think that in all three countries
Mexico the United States and Canada
labor rights had been harmed by the
NAFTA agreements Anna gave many examples
the Economic Policy Institute had three
major studies one by a by specialists on
Mexico United States and Canada
indicating that which gave plenty of
evidence that in all three countries the
large majority of the population been
harmed mostly in Mexico were is quite
serious well okay maybe you can argue
about whether the results are right or
not but what's interesting is they
weren't discussed there was virtually no
mention of there was no mention of them
at the meeting and as far as I could
find virtually no mention in the press
well you know people ought to know if
this is a democratic process than the
population of the three countries ought
to be right very well-informed about the
fact that two major organizations
investigative organizations have looked
into
President Bush's claims in considerable
detail and I've already and have
presented information saying it's
exactly the opposite that wasn't
reported all that was reported was I
isn't it wonderful the Masters helping
everybody we can go on and on well you
know all of this is an indication not
only that it's not a democratic process
but that power centers are deeply
committed to prevent it from being a
democratic process and the reason is
they know the public is opposed not
everybody of course but a substantial
part probably the majority of the public
is opposed and that's worldwide so
therefore you wouldn't see
when people say business ought to be
represented very clear what that means
I'm in this business get this business
get represented twice both because
they're people and because they're
business but that's okay I have other
organizations represented why not have
unions organized ended why not have
environmental groups that represent it I
mean they're you know business is not
like an entity opposed to the population
it's just people in a particular
position in the population yeah you know
we're talking with Noam Chomsky this is
hell every Saturday morning at 9:00
o'clock you're listening to WN you are
89.3 FM a couple of things I've heard on
different news sources this week just in
the last couple of weeks really irked me
especially in light of doing my research
on you I saw ray Suarez the other day on
the Lehrer report he was discussing what
is going on in East Timor right now and
it's East Timor in case the audience
does not know held their first free
elections this week yet no the articles
you see happy smiling people and the
pictures and you hear really great news
of finally having free elections and
there was no word about us complicity by
both Republican and Democratic
administrations within their horrible
human rights offenses that were going on
in the country by the Indonesian
military and ray Suarez said that the
East Timor are the Cambodian he was
saying that it was 25 years since the
Cambodian killing fields he said that
that was easily the worst genocide I'll
practice that has happened since world
war two which was Cambodia or Cambodia
was it it was quite comparable to East
Timor the relative to population East
Timor may have probably was higher and
it was at the same time I mean the the
atrocities in in CHEM the Pol Pot
atrocities took place from April 1975 to
January 1979
the vietnamese put a stop to them by
kicking Pol Pot out of the country the
East treaty memories atrocities the
major ones the ones that led to the
destruction of maybe a third quarter
population they took place in exactly
the same years all right
the East T Murray's ones continued they
continued through the 80s they continued
again they were horrifying in 1999
throughout that's that's you know that's
the it's hard to compare atrocities
they're all different in all kind of
ways but they were certainly comparable
furthermore the Indonesian ones were not
only crimes against humanity but also
war crimes this was outright aggression
vicious outright aggression condemned by
the United Nations but the United States
acted our own ambassador Daniel Moynihan
made it very clear blamed with pride
that he had on State Department orders
rendered the United Nations utterly
ineffective and anything that might do
to stop the atrocities which he was well
aware of the major difference between
these two cases is that in one case you
could attribute it to an official enemy
at least if you didn't pay attention to
what was happening before and after
where the US was very deeply involved in
atrocities but if you just limited to
you know April 1975 to January 1979 you
can pretend that it was just some enemy
who was doing it so therefore a great
outrage in the case of East Timor
comparable in those years and then
becoming much worse later they can't say
that it was the US that was primarily
responsible by providing the arms by
providing diplomatic support by
suppressing the facts here which was
done media contribution all right and
that continued and then the Britain got
in by 1978 at the peak of the massacres
Britain got heavily involved in
implementing them what went on right
through September 1999 and then at a
time after the vote when the Indonesian
army went on a real rampage and you know
maybe 85% of
population out of their homes and
destroyed about 70% of the country after
that the official US position was
quoting it it's the responsibility of
the Indonesians and we don't want to
take it away from them
so not a move to try to stop it about a
week later under enormous international
pressure and domestic pressure Clinton
was compelled to shift this policy he
made some gestures indicating to the
Indonesian generals that they should
call it off within 48 hours they were
out that indicates the latent power that
was always there and it indicates very
clearly where the responsibility lies
for everything that happened quite apart
from the fact that the US was providing
along with Britain the arms and training
and diplomatic support and so on so yeah
these these things are different in one
case if you narrow your sight
sufficiently you can attribute it to an
enemy in the other case you got to look
into the mirror that's the main
difference other than that they're quite
comparable of traffic also another thing
I saw on the news this was on Sunday
mornings Fox News Sunday the Atwood
luckily I do not get the Fox News
Channel but the Fox News Sunday the
comparable show to Meet the Press Face
the Nation whatever at the same time
slot on Sunday mornings they had a
political they had a roundtable and
there was somebody from the Washington
Post I can't remember all the people
were involved but one of them was Juan
Williams of National Public Radio's Talk
of the Nation and he said that his
sister had just come back from
Switzerland and that she said you know
how can you how do you feel about being
an American it's kind of embarrassing
being in Europe because of our
unwillingness to support the Kyoto
Protocol to sign on to the treaty for
germ warfare and especially what
happened in the Florida election and
Juan Williams then said you know I just
I couldn't take it I just said you know
you just got to get over it you just got
to move on and the host of Fox News
Sunday actually did like a slapping
motion as if he was punishing this woman
for even saying this what do you see
what do you think about somebody
was trying to tell us that we should
forget about things that actually just
happened and are going on and as far as
the Kyoto Protocol and the germ warfare
3d and the militarization of space and
other things none are they going on
there there's a reasonable probability
that those things will lead to
destruction of human life we're not
talking about minor things I think I
didn't hear that comment and you know I
like to talk about individuals and I
haven't heard them right but anyone who
says that let's make it abstract what
they're doing is living up to a kind of
a major principle of life unfortunately
which is don't look into the mirror you
know look at somebody else's faults but
don't look at your own you can find nice
comments about this in the Gospels if
you want and it's unfortunately there's
there is such 10 it's very easy it's
very convenient to say look I'm only
gonna look at what the other guy did
that was wrong I'm never gonna look at
myself I'm not gonna look at the mirror
and ask what I'm responsible for because
then that raises you know hard questions
it's much easier to talk about how
rotten the other guy is
I will familiar with this and it's a
it's a profoundly immoral position and
it went in the case of an extremely
powerful country like ours and people
who are like us who are therefore very
influential and what in the fate of the
world it's not only immoral it's how do
you feel about the I'm trying to figure
out how to word this how do you feel
about the logic of voting with your
dollar by being a smarter consumer we
can undermine the odious actions of
corporations simply by boycotting them
or when someone like you've said in many
occasions that the the media is about
selling to advertisers it's not about
the audience yet if you talk to somebody
who is within that medium and of course
they've already bought into the value
system of that medium they would say
that well we're the only way that we can
sell advertising is if the audience is
there and we have this democratic
mechanism of the Nielsen ratings that
tell us if the audience is there so how
would you
how would you react to those types of
consumer statements that the Nielsen's
are a democratic system that and that
voting with your dollars is an
appropriate way to act as a consumer
within a capitalist democracy voting
with your dollars is an interesting form
of democracy democracy means each person
has an equal equal participation in
decision-making as democracy our dollar
is equally distributed voting with
dollars is a you know kind of like
arguing that the Soviet Union under
Stalin's Democratic yeah money people
could participate but in different ways
you were in the communist party
hierarchy you had a form of authority
that you didn't have if you were
somebody in the streets even though they
could make their opinion expressed to
voting with your dollars is a radical
attack on democracy as far as the
Nielsen ratings are concerned of what is
being measured is the way people are
choosing under a highly structured set
of choices which are given to them by
major corporate institutions which have
their own agendas and commitments quite
naturally you know don't blame the major
corporation for trying to advance its
own interests crazy that didn't but
that's not choices for example there's
very little doubt that I mean assuming I
think the Wall Street Journal is quite
correct and other business press and
recognizing and in fact polls show us
this that the public is quite concerned
and are strongly opposed to government
decisions on many issues like for
example the so-called trade agreements
so people would I'm sure like very much
to know what's going on at the FTA but
what's being planned for them but they
don't get that choice that choice is not
one that's available there was no choice
available as to whether you wanted to
hear what the careful reports were
saying about the effects of NAFTA people
care about that and for sure
very clearly that people care about it
as do demonstrations and so on but
they're not being given that up this is
controlled options within which you're
allowed to make you know it's it's like
a Democrat it's like let's call the
democratic election and totalitarian
states where you can pick one or another
of two party hacks that's it's not
exactly like that but that's what it's
about and certainly this idea of voting
with your dollars it's really worth
thinking about it's true that that
mythology is talked about it's supposed
to be a wonderful thing all right we're
supposed to be what are called Chicago
is all about this that's where it comes
from
we're supposed to be rational wealth
maximizers each individual is supposed
to be trying to maximize his or her own
wealth and to use their dollars in the
marketplace to do that well you know
let's go back to the Kyoto Protocol's
from that point of view if you accept
that ideology ideology then it's
entirely reasonable to destroy the
environment in fact it's a worthwhile
thing and the reason is quite simple
all right there are individuals who
don't have any dollars at the vote
within the market like your
grandchildren your grandchildren who may
not be alive I don't have dollars to
vote in the market now therefore if we
are irrational to destroy the
possibility for them to have a viable
existence in order to maximize the
number of shooters we had in fact that
almost follows logically from the
ideology we're supposed to worship all
right it is rational but within a system
an institutional and ideological system
it's totally lunatic and entirely you
know horrendously opposed to ordinary
human values those are things we should
be concerned about you say the same
about militarization of space I mean
what's masked under missile defense best
defense sounds nicer than offense but if
you get away from the Orwellian
deception what's called missile defense
minor component of a major move towards
militarization of space to ensure
extending the arms race into space where
the u.s. is way in the lead or creating
offensive weapons the massive systems of
destruction that can be used for global
dominance the administration and this
runs through administration's like the
major documents we have her from the
Clinton administration high-level
documents are saying look we got to do
this for the same reason that Britain
had a navy to control the commerce and
investment opportunities of the British
all through the world we need the
control space for that and we have to
have offensive military capacity to
ensure that we can immediately destroy
anyone gets in the way what they talk
about is yeah that's that makes sense to
if you don't care about the question of
whether the world will survive in
another generation I mean these policies
raised significantly the chances of what
are called in the literature normal
accidents any complicated system is
going to have unpredictable accidents
anybody who has a computer knows that
everyone's know what else only goes
wrong for some unpredictable reason and
when you get really complicated systems
it happens all the time
so there's a technical concept called
normal accidents when you get something
like a hair-trigger command and control
systems that are going to launch you
know laser like death rays if they think
something's going wrong all right like
some other countries shooting off an
anti-satellite weapon you're making it
highly likely that normal accidents will
appear those normal accidents are not
like your computer crashing they're like
the world going up in smoke but it makes
perfect sense to accept that possibility
if it leads to short-term gain
short-term gain both in our local
control so the policies of
self-destruction have a kind of
rationality I once read an article about
20 years ago and the whole Star Wars
lunacy was unquote the rationality of
collective to us
and the point of it was to say yes there
within a framework of lunatic
institutional and ideological
commitments within that framework it is
rational to carry out actions which may
well lead the collective suicide well
that or a raisin I think that's true and
it's even more true now and in order
raise serious questions about the
institutions in the ideology it disturbs
me what I hear people say that they are
doing something for the children and
then they don't think about actually the
children's children are the future in
any way what they are doing is trying to
hide behind their children's cloaks in a
way which speak with Noam Chomsky Noam I
only have a couple more questions for
you but our producer Kevin Harris has a
really quick question for you Kevin yeah
I know I was listening to a lecture on
Anzhi magazine online from Danny
Schechter and he was talking about in
reference to a lot of what you have been
saying about how you know a lot of
people come up and say like this is it a
conspiracy is this a bunch of people
acting in conjunction and all the way
down through the institutions and the
point that he made that of course that
you make is that you're not going to get
and I wish you could elaborate on this
get to a certain position in these
institutions without having a certain
plan in mind in other words it weeds out
anybody I would question the institution
in the first place I think our own
personal lives how do you make it you
know like people like us got the good
colleges okay what's called a good
education just think back how'd we do it
I mean did we do it by telling the 4th
grade teacher the high school teacher
that we thought what they were telling
us was perfect nonsense even when we
knew it was we got it by being obedient
from the very beginning you're trained
to be what's quote you know not a
troublemaker be obedient do what you're
told
don't make a fuss about things just kind
of don't you know go along and the
people don't do that or are identified
they become behave
problems or something rather get weeded
out those of us who are capable of being
beat of being even if we don't like it
saying okay I'll the obedient go along
and get to the next stage oh yeah we get
a hit talking about myself
could have easily told the high school
teacher talking a lot of nonsense in the
history class but into it I just did the
stupid work we were assigned and got a
hit all right and you know that kind of
gets in first of all there's a kind of a
selection for obedience and after and
then after all just gets ingrained I
mean if you're it's very difficult to do
one thing and believe something else
is he gone doing it end up believing it
and slowly over the years there's a
selection for or maybe even honest
acceptance of the ideology now people
just say yeah I think that's right okay
they'll get it hit there's a whole
complicated selectional process and I
really think most people are aware of it
from their own lives they look back
honestly which leads to the conclusion
that the people in high places are those
who accept the framework I mean if I
remember reading things by you know the
are called the left-wing critics of say
the New York Times Tom wicker and
Anthony Lewis who say very outraged
nobody tells me what to write and
they're absolutely correct the critics
are not saying that anyone tells them
what to write but they're saying is you
wouldn't be in a position to write if
you hadn't already internalized the
ideology otherwise you'd be driving a
taxicab all right and that goes on right
through a professional life people
teaching in universities are familiar
with it and another institution you go
along or you tend to get in trouble you
know it's not like a mechanical system
so there are kind of ways of finessing
it getting through and so forth but it's
a tendency it's a strong tendency and it
has its effect incorporation
even more so these are after all
tyrannical systems you have to obey but
Minh I'm it has its effect the
institutions furthermore have their own
structure they have their own like if
you're the suppose you're the CEO of a
big corporation you don't have the
choice of being a decent human being
it's not your choice I mean it here I
agree with Milton Friedman you know your
responsibility in fact your legal
responsibility is to maximize profit and
market share for the benefit of the
stockholders that's your responsibility
not your responsibility to see that
workers have decent conditions or that
the environment doesn't get destroyed
you spend your time and effort on that
you're not gonna be CEO very long
somebody'll take ya it's an
institutional fact that the person in
that position has to act like a moral
monster it's not a individual
particularly individual it's of the
institution again like the things we
were talking about before well you know
all of this ends up in a in a system in
which certain kinds of things are
overwhelmingly likely to happen and not
because people fit in a you know in the
Bilderberg conference and decide to do
it that way of course that's not what
there's no I thought her deep-seated
institutional reasons that go you know
that permeate much of the society and
that are heightened and sharpened in
eventually took tyrannical institutions
like corporations which have by now
enormous power I linked to one another
tied to powerful states extremely
influential and setting the framework
within even the most democratic states
have to function yeah that's I'm the
media are just part of that of course so
that leads now that leads to
consequences which can be ameliorated
and they should be ameliorated what the
long-term solution is not to ameliorate
them um you can ameliorate slavery to
make it less onerous the problem is get
rid of it you know
you've said unless you internalize the
values of America being a superior
nation being or being superior having a
superior government even a benevolent
government as you were just saying you
end up being a taxicab driver or you
might end up like me being a better
blind broke gap-toothed radio show host
it was a great internal to the
institutions like the media and look I
had personal friends in the media way
high up some of the best-known people
that won't mention names who are much
more cynical about them than I am if
they see it from the inside and they try
to create a space for themselves where
they can do certain things and kind of
get away with it and I've all kind of
techniques for doing it you know when my
two questions for one question is the
question from hell which is how we
finish every interview we're speaking
with the Noam Chomsky we always try to
ask a difficult question or a question
that is just kind of I don't know silly
maybe but I had another question before
and I just don't I don't think that you
could do this in a brief amount of time
and I don't want to ask you to lessen
the value of such an important question
but we've had people on like Dunson
Bruce from Chumbawamba penny Rimbaud
from band called crass we've had Chuck
go on from this internet at this
anarchist internet Clearing House called
info shop org and every one of them
seems to have an opinion or actually a
definition of what Anarchy is it seems
to be completely opposite of what you
either hear the media saying or maybe
even some trendy poseur saying who
believe that all Anarchy is is about
complete destruction absolutely no
organization whatsoever whatsoever and
everybody just doing what they want to
do and not working together whatsoever
is there any way that you could define
Anarchy in brief period of time where is
that just too important of a question
you know nobody owns the word so you can
say it is whatever you feel it is but if
you take a look at the anarchist
tradition it's a very rich tradition
deeply rooted in the American tradition
I should say
wife and practice more than ideology if
you take a look back at the anarchist
tradition way it's been implemented and
formulated and so on but almost
everybody is committed to a highly
organized society but a society that's
organized from below that is it's based
on popular participation at every level
voluntary association interactions among
associations federal Arrangements
workers control and factories community
control and in communities interactions
between the two in fact a very elaborate
proposals have been made about anarchist
organization in the in the rich
tradition if you ask what it's all about
but put it in a phrase and then as I say
people can look at it differently but
it's always meant to me and I think this
is like the core of the tradition that
goes way back is a commitment to
question authority
if you discover an authoritarian
relation a relationship with control and
domination anywhere family life
international society where it is if you
it discovers such a relation a challenge
ask if it's legitimate it's not self
legitimizing any relation of power and
authority has to justify itself if it
can't it ought to be dismantled now
sometimes that relations can be
justified like I'm taking a walk with my
you know four-year-old granddaughter in
the street and she runs out traffic and
I grabbed her arm and pull back that's
an authoritarian relation but I think I
can justify it and there are many others
that in particular circumstances you
know you can give a justification for
but the point is it's the burden the
burden of proof is on the person who
exercises the authority and most of the
time they can't do it you know the major
problem in social change this has to do
with what are you talking about slavery
or women's rights or political freedom
or anything else I mean the major
problem is what's called raising
consciousness that is recognizing that
you are in a position
of subordination and domination that
you're the victim of subordination and
domination that's not easy to do you
tend to kind of accept the world the way
it is and even to perceive that there is
domination that ought to be questioned
that's a very hard move and the major
move and social change in revolution
over history right to the present once
you can get to that level of
consciousness then you ask well it's the
it's the responsibility of those
exercising the authority to justify
themselves if they can't do it so
legitimate so legitimate to work to
dismantle and set up a more free and
participatory society there's no end to
this process it's kind of an ongoing
process like mountain climbing
you know you climb you see a peak and
you think okay I'll work hard and get
there when you're there all of a sudden
you notice there's another higher peak
farther beyond okay more
consciousness-raising
and I presume that's you know human life
insofar as it's decent to go on that way
so anarchism is I see it's kind of like
a tendency in human affairs seeking to
create more freedom or this undermine
more discover or legitimate Authority
which is or I challenge it find ways to
undermine it
and you may have answered this question
within that question but this is the
question for from Hell for Noam Chomsky
first of all I want to thank you for
being on the show but I found that
anarchists and from doing this show
not from beforehand I'd always had a
different impression of anarchists but I
found from doing this show that anarchic
anarchists are very optimistic people I
had the impression they were very
pessimistic that they thought that the
world was in a horrible disarray and
that we needed to destroy everything and
rebuild it but in fact from doing this
show I found that anarchists are very
optimistic people who believe the
populace wants democracy wants self-rule
Watts community rule wants neighborhoods
get together and be part of a community
yet here in the United States only half
the people vote most support monopolies
when I go to
I mean my friends you know are very anti
for instance Microsoft but if I go to a
bar and you know I open my mind and
realize that just my friends aren't you
know my circle of friends are not the
whole entire world it seems to me that
most people do not vote they have no
interest in voting or in politics most
support monopolies like Microsoft and
that communities neighbors are kind of
pitted against each other in a sense
that people are isolated from each other
either by self leisure from watching
television or whatever they they don't
interact my neighbors I don't even live
in that transient of a neighborhood and
a lot of people just won't even say
hello to you on the street so what makes
you think that people here in the United
States what makes you think that people
here in the United States really want
democracy not voting can just be
interpreted in many ways and I think the
right way to interpret it and I think
public opinion studies which have been
carried out there to support this is
that the reason people don't vote is
because they don't think there's an
election going on I mentioned something
earlier which is just one piece of a
major university project called the
alienated voter project kind of figure
out why people don't vote and it shows
quite consistently that they just don't
think there's any choices or they think
they don't see much point in choosing
between two representatives of the
corporate world who you can't understand
and because they're crafted by public
relations officers to come out with
words that they don't mean and they
probably understand themselves if that's
what you think is happening which is not
unrealistic then you know well people
won't even bother and if you did
anything take a closer look take the
last election again pretty typical the
people who did vote around half the jury
voted against their own interest
unconsciously so so when people are
asked about issues you know which
candidate do you prefer on issues then
you run through a bunch of issues most
of the time they can't figure out
where the candidates stand on issues and
it's not because they're stupid I mean
anybody who watched the debates knows
you know you know what they're talking
about hiss and nor do they but to the
extent that people could identify issues
like rather large majorities they they
prefer war or to put it more accurately
they disliked Bush more like either of
them that they disliked wish more on
issues and they vote was kind of a
statistical tie which means that people
didn't vote on issues they voted on what
in the public relations literature is
quote qualities you know you're supposed
to in fact they try to craft to design
the election so that if you vote at all
you vote on the question of you know is
this the kind of guy I'd like to meet in
a bar you know or is this the kind of
guy he didn't fourth grade because he
was know-it-all no qualit what's both
qualities but not issues you want to
keep issues out of the election like for
the population in the last election one
of the top issues was actually the trade
deficit if people know what that means
that translates into their jobs and
their lives and so on major issues were
these trade agreements they didn't even
come up in the election yeah I discussed
the print the way in which the elections
are run which is a kind of a narrow
competition between various sectors of
private power and people know that you
just don't bring it in issues on which
you know that the public the ultimate
weapon and the Wall Street Journal's
term you know they're going to be
opposed
you just don't raise those issues raise
issues of you know this guy
I look good at friendly or you know you
like to meet him or something like that
also the failure to vote is from this
point of view which i think is an
accurate one is not opposition to
democracy its commitment to democracy
and seeing that it's not going on right
that's an interesting analysis of it but
what would you say about people who like
support monopoly
appellees omit they take me I mean I
happened to be sitting in front of a
computer right now on the computer is a
screen you know something I was writing
when you called well that happens to be
using Windows it's not cuz i like
microsoft fact I hate I hate the program
thing but I'm using Windows but there
are people who would be for like I mean
I'll be sitting in a bar and a guy will
say hey listen would Bill Gates was
smart enough to come up with this
shouldn't he be rewarded for you know
even I know that's completely inaccurate
but they there's a feeling that you
should be rewarded with all of the booty
if you actually are the person who owned
the company and you should be able to
overwhelm a market and that's ok because
that's the American Way well then we
have a number of questions have to be
asked first of all is it the American
Way
and if it is the American Way is at the
right way I mean was something the right
way in Russia in 1953 because it was the
Russian way obviously not a furthermore
the assumption is just wrong Bill Gates
didn't come up with the idea in fact
Gates himself has said has said honestly
that his great genius is being able to
take the ideas of others and turn them
into a way to make money other people
came up with the ideas though they are
maybe unaware of it are US taxpayers the
thing that I'm sitting in front of this
computer with that you know this fancy
computer with that complicated software
on it that was mostly came out of public
public initiative it it was developed
he'd take a look at the history of the
computer industry I was developed in the
1950s and the 1960s primarily under the
rubric of the military like my wife for
example back in the 1950s was a
programmer and a secret West called
secret project I know exactly what it
was like that was working on what was
called air defense they weren't working
on air defense everybody knew it I mean
they were working on a program that
maybe with luck
could have stopped the World War one
bomber pilot Snoopy or something like
that what they were actually doing was
working out the basic design of the
modern computer at those days computers
a computer with some huge thing with a
whole bunch of rooms of blowing up all
the time was that vacuum tubes tubes and
so on they were kind of work it down to
a point where it could be usable and
sellable when that happened the director
of the project pulled off and found that
one of the first mainframe producers I
mean the reason IBM isn't producing
typewriters is because they were getting
huge contracts from the public under the
framework of the Defense Department
military to to improve that design and
the operation of computers when it
finally got down to the point where they
became marketable yeah then it was
handed over to private corporations and
people like Bill Gates could run with it
the same is true of a part of modern
technology I think I don't know if in
Baker
you mentioned talked about this but one
of these very important studies that he
did I had to do with the pharmaceutical
industry now the pharmaceutical industry
claims they need these terrifically high
profits because of because of all the
innovation and research and so on that
they carry out if they don't get the
profits we won't get new drugs well you
know Dean Baker good economist asked a
simple question how much of the R&D the
research and development or other
companies actually paying for well you
know turns out that the public is
through the through public expenditures
is paying a very substantial share
probably somewhere in the 40 50 50
percent range of R&D furthermore that's
a serious underestimate because the part
that the public is paying for is what's
fundamental to the new development a
large part of what the corporations are
paying for is you know me to drugs you
know somebody else has one I'll make one
like it or you know frills around the
edge all right
if you did an honest analysis you'd
probably find that a considerable
majority of the funding they're just
coming out of the public purse so taker
mate is the obvious question suppose we
raise the public contribution to a
hundred percent say they roughly double
it less than that okay that eliminate
and then let that make the companies to
sell them on the market without the
production we set the love market right
let them sell their drugs on the market
without the huge protection that comes
from these highly protectionist patent
regimes that have been imposed on the
world and he calculated there would be
an enormous reduction in costs and that
the over what the savings would simply
be overwhelming I mean they would swamp
the by orders of magnitude the total
savings anticipated by the most
optimistic predictions of the trade
agreement and then that would eliminate
the argument that well we need the
profits because of R&D well you know
that's not a proposal good sense but
that gets back to who had the bright
idea
now the bright idea usually comes out of
the public very commonly comes out of
the public purse and then it's not that
the guy you met in the bar figured out
how to design a computer all right well
thank you very much for being on this
morning's show no I really appreciate it
I've got so many notes here I could
interview you for another six hours and
I really hope that I get the opportunity
to do this again it's been a real
pleasure and I really appreciate you
coming on our show
all right thank you no yep
