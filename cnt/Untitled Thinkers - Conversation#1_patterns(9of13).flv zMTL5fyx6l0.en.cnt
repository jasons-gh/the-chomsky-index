nothing beyond simple truths one thing
is that Mother Nature doesn't hand your
answers to you on a silver platter you
got to work to find them and that kind
of work requires that creative
imagination hard work greatest genius
Einsteins not going to come easy
integrity and a critical mind you have
to you can't question everything but you
would have a slight question about
everything and sometimes that slight
question is worth pursuing now when you
turn from the sciences to the study of
human affairs it's in a sense easier and
it's just harder it's easier in the
sense of the theme it's much more what
can be understood as much more
superficial so in the study of history
say or sociology you don't get
principles of even remotely the depth
that you find in studying the Natural
Sciences on the eye from another point
of view it's harder and a mother nature
does not give the answers on a silver
platter but she doesn't set up obstacles
either in human affairs there's plenty
of obstacles that up doctrinal systems
are putting up obstacles to
understanding what's going on education
in many ways is creating doctrinal
frameworks which shape you're thinking
and impose barriers to understanding and
it's pretty systematic whenever we look
at any complex system I think we begin
to think about are there things we can
do to tame the complexity so we can
understand how a system works and have
some faith in it and there certainly are
and we've learned that over time I mean
if you think about the number of lines
of code in microsoft windows in excess
of a million line
code the fact that it works at all is
astonishing is astonishing and we've
built things of tremendous complexity
now obviously we've learned some
organizational principles we've learned
about abstraction as a way of doing
something so we can we can create a
something that that performs in some way
whether it be a physical object or a
piece of computer software we can
encapsulate it and say this piece of
software performs this and you can now
use it as a tool and if you think about
if you think about Excel it's a tool
it's a tool to help people who need to
keep track of things build spreadsheets
and they use it as a tool in that way so
we built a level of abstraction that
makes it easier for them to do something
at a higher level hierarchy is another
way in which we think about simplifying
things by by using a hierarchical
structure but i think the other amazing
thing is humans have been able to
construct systems that no one person
really understands how the whole thing
works and yet it works more or less may
not always work perfectly but it works
and we've been able to use our
collective intelligence to construct
something that's extremely complicated
and can achieve a level of functionality
that's truly remarkable and that's a
real tribute to the power of the human
brain and I think our ability to to
integrate the ability to communicate
with one another and to grasp things
whose overall complexity is simply
amazing when I look today at the
complexity of the computer hardware we
build or the software we make if you
told me 30 years ago when I was a young
faculty member starting that we're going
to be building things of this complexity
I would say well you may try but they
would work because they'll be too
complex they'll be beyond our skills to
really know that that software is going
to work properly without crashing all
with dynamo that that hardware will
actually ever work
but we've managed to do it which is an
amazing testimony to order to master
things of incredible complexity I think
that around 17th century humankind got
the sense that it stands above nature
and it can bend nature to its will and
it unleashed an enormous energy and
scientific inquiry and discovery but
we've now come full circle we're at the
end of that cycle where we stood above
nature when now at last are at a point
where we realize hey we are part of it
and that we can go on and we can destroy
ourselves and nature in its entirety oh
we can develop it a step further so yes
there is progress but I wanted I'm just
simply cautioning that do not define
progress however you see it as an
automatic outcome it's a pic it's a very
fine non deterministic and yet it says
we ought to see ourselves in nature and
such a humble part of nature because we
are only now beginning to understand
that
