I'm disciplined so I'll talk about what
I was asked to talk which is Iraq and
the connection between Iraq and the
so-called war on terror there is a
connection it's pretty thin but it's
been drawn intelligence agencies have
pointed out that they can't detect any
real connection between Iraq and the
terrorist networks al-qaeda and the rest
which isn't too surprising but there is
a connection over the last and it's been
pointed out namely we can create a link
if we want and the best way to create
the link would be by attacking Iraq it's
expected brought widely that if we do
attack Iraq that's very likely to ignite
terrorist attacks maybe that are already
being planned as a possible deterrent
and it's very likely to spawn a new
generation of terrorists will be seeking
revenge and also deterrence and the
deterrence is not a slight matter have
you've been following the international
relations literature I'm gonna be very
establishment in this talk I'm only
gonna quote people right in the
mainstream people have been following it
know that leading scholars respected
figures in international relations have
been pointing out for some time in fact
well before Bush that the that u.s.
adventurism is stimulating a
proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction as a deterrent that's not
just countries that are being
specifically targeted for attack but
others who are concerned about deterring
a state that seeks I'm quoting now
unilateral world domination through
absolute military superiority and is
becoming a menace to itself and the
world under a radical nationalist
leadership I've been quoting Kenneth
waltz well-known figure in international
relations and
Anatoli Evan who's the senior associate
of the Carnegie Endowment for
international peace that in fact even
real hardliners are expressing pretty
serious concerns so one of the leading
military and strategic analysts is
concerned primarily with the Middle East
Anthony Cordesman is about as hardline
as you can get within anything that
might be called the spectrum of sanity
he's been weren't he warned recently
against what he called the
neoconservative a disease of the sillier
armchair strategists and their plans for
reconstructing the Middle East and maybe
the world he was referring to Richard
Perle and Douglas Feith but that also
includes Wolfowitz Rumsfeld others who
all happened to be very close to the
extreme right wing in Israel so you're
getting quite a lot of clear and good
reporting from the mainstream Israeli
press about them as maybe you know
Richard Perle who's very close to the
center of planning now and with faith
were writing position papers for
Benjamin Netanyahu
Israel's new foreign minister who's weld
at the right of Ariel Sharon you know
they were doing that a 1990s and that's
their connections and context and it's
not understandable that even a hard-line
military analysts like courtesan is
worried about their a sillier proposals
which are in fact being thought about
and may be implemented well why that's
about the only connection I know of
between Iraq and terrorism at the moment
we can stimulate terrorism if we really
intend to so why Iraq I mean obviously
not in order to stimulate terrorism well
before going into that again with a kind
of a truism it should be unnecessary to
mention in the case of
the threat of or resort to violence the
burden of proof is always on those who
advocate so that's true whether it's a
domestic abuse or international affairs
and it's a heavy burden and maybe
there's an argument for it but it's the
person it's those who advocate force and
violence who have to bear the burden and
it's a heavy one you never need any
arguments against the use of violence
that's automatic and you can argument
for it has to be very strong one that
should be obvious and I'll just put it
in back so why are why are they why they
want to do it well they're just to
simplify since times brief I'll pick two
views that are expressed pretty
prominently in the mainstream and I'll
quote mainstream analysts so here's the
first interpretation I'll start with the
use of Abraham and the International
Herald Tribune a couple of days ago he's
a senior fellow of the Council on
Foreign Relations and was a senior
Middle East correspondent for the New
York Times in The Wall Street Journal
for about thirty years recently moved to
the CFR recently his interpretation is
that the goals of the Bush
administration are basically to one
gaining short-term political advantage
and to I'm quoting him now and turning
Iraq into a private American oil pumping
station well there's a counter-argument
to that
against that in The New York Times
yesterday maybe your response to it I
don't know by Serge I'm a man who argues
that kind of disparage is the oil
relationship on the grounds that there's
not going to be an instant bonanza for
Iraqi oil and it's true but it's not a
very persuasive argument I mean by the
same argument you can prove that nobody
was interested in iraqi oil 80 years ago
or Texas oil or Saudi Arabian oil or
Venezuelan oil or certainly not
in our North CF oil I mean really
expensive to get it
so by that argument yeah it's true
you're not going to get billions of
dollars tomorrow and it'll take
development funds but the argument is
very weak fact much weaker in the case
of Iraqi oil which is vast and
relatively easily accessible than it was
in numerous other cases so I think we
can dismiss the counter-argument the
which was I think a front-page story and
at times we can review yesterday
well that's yusuf ibrahim yevon who i
quoted before has a more detailed
analysis along the same lines he
suggests that the bush administration
the political aspect is following I'm
quoting him the classic modern strategy
of an endangered right wing oligarchy
which is to divert mass discontent into
nationalism inspired by fear of enemies
about to destroy us and he speaks for
many people in the world when he regards
that as a US government government's
policies now as a menace to itself
meaning the country and to the world
well September 11th provided a pretext
for resort to force not just for the
United States that's worldwide and it
was predicted at once so the Russians
and Chechnya the Chinese against their
Western minorities Indonesian J Israel
and the occupied territories I mean all
over the world repressive governments
that were engaged in violent repression
used September 11th as a pretext to
intensify it under the guise of a war on
terror and assuming correctly that
they'd get a nod of approval from the
bluff in Washington and it's not too
surprising that the u.s. itself would
adopt the same idea so yes 9/11 was a
pretext and it was also used as a
pretext
to discipline populations throughout the
world again under the guise of a war on
terror and that ranges from the Central
Asian dictatorships all the way over to
the more democratic countries including
our own also the fact that member xi
would prove the pretext for a war in
iraq is not a great surprise and in fact
this was pointed out also to pursue the
domestic political agenda as the event
points out natural for an endangered
right wing oligarchy to do that
especially when it's carrying out a
quite an extensive attack against the
domestic population it's not a big
secret or it shouldn't be in the u.s.
that was pointed out right away by for
example by paul krugman and one of his
well-known economists and one of his
regular New York Times columns who
reported right away that literally
before the dust had settled over the
World Trade Center ruins influential
Republicans signaled that they were
determined to use terrorism as an excuse
to pursue a radical right-wing agenda
and he and others have been documenting
how they've been following that course
ever since
again shouldn't be a secret so I won't
pursue it the Beast of Baghdad was then
brought in to be an even more terrifying
threat and there are also independent
reasons there is a long-standing goal
Ibrahim and others are surely correct
and it's kind of obvious there's been
it's been a long-standing goal to
restore to us control the second-largest
oil reserves in the world it's been
recognized
ever since the mid 40s the State
Department in 1945 that this is a major
component of what they called a
stupendous source of strategic power and
one of the greatest material prizes in
world history and a major theme of US
foreign policy since the Second World
War
has been to make sure that the u.s.
dominates France was expelled on the
interesting grounds that it was an enemy
state since it had been occupied by
Germany so therefore its contracts were
void and England was slowly reduced to
let the Foreign Office calls a British
Foreign Office calls a junior partner
the u.s. puts it differently forty years
ago a senior statesman probably Dean
Acheson an internal discussion described
Britain as para lieutenant the
fashionable word is partner and they'd
like to hear the fashionable word
reality is the actual word and control
over Middle East oil has been a very
large part of it from the Second World
War
let me stress that it's control it's not
access there's a lot of confusion about
that the United States really doesn't
care much about access to Middle East
oil from up until 1970 didn't care at
all North America was the bigger the
biggest producer but that didn't affect
the need to control the region since
then it biggest importers usually been
Venezuela if you look at US intelligence
projections for example the National
Intelligence Council projections for the
next 15 years they predict them suggest
that the US should rely on a more secure
Atlantic Basin resources West Africa and
Latin America ever that athlete nothing
to do with control over Middle East oil
now that has to do with its being one of
the greatest material prizes in world
history which means that whoever
controls it and can have an effect on
setting the price and production levels
can also determine that the wealth vast
amount of the wealth flows right back
here and it does it's independent of
axis the oil a stupendous source of
strategic power has nothing to do with
access that has the translates as a
lever of world control and that's been
recognized clearly since the 1940s and
it remains true today
well September 11th gave a pretext the
domestic politics affects the timing
and the strategy has been working quite
brilliantly you see right now in the
midterm elections the it's gonna be even
more important next year presumably if
you put yourselves and say Karl Rove's
shoes which is campaign manager when the
presidential campaign begins and a
little over a year do you really want
people to be thinking about what's
happening to their pension or how
they're going to take care of their
elderly mother you know what's what
about their job you know why is why
can't they get health care that was what
about an environment that their children
might live in the things like that or
certainly not what they want people to
be paying attention to they want they'll
want people to be you know praised
singing praises to the brave cowboy who
saved them from destruction at the hands
of a colossal foe you know sort of
Martian foe and will by then be marching
on to something new adventure exactly as
Viet Minh says that's the tradition
that's the classic strategy of an
endangered right wing oligarchy which
wants to divert mass content which has
plenty of ground into nationalism and
fear and it takes a lot of work to
overlook the fact that the only people
who are afraid of Condoleezza Rice's a
mushroom cloud which is going to consume
us imminently the only people who are
afraid of it or Americans not the people
of the region for example I'm they're
afraid but they're afraid in the United
States more than they are of their back
of course it Rockies are afraid of
Saddam Hussein and they have every right
to be but that can't possibly be the
reason for the US war I mean the US was
supporting Saddam right through his
worst atrocities helping him develop
weapons of mass destruction right up to
the day of the invasion of Kuwait and
it's the same people who are in running
Washington right now so whatever the
reasons
it's not that the so yeah they're you
know they're afraid of said I'm saying
but they also know that he can't do very
much in fact very little if he made a
move anywhere or actively obliterated
and he knows that and the people in the
region know that but even the US press
the national press which is usually
highly supportive of power now
recognizes that in quoting the world is
more concerned about the unbridled use
of American power than it is about the
threat posed by Saddam Hussein it's a
lead story in the Christian Science
Monitor a couple days ago and it's been
pointed out by others so there's there
definitely is a security issue there's a
problem of securing the agenda of the
radical right-wing oligarchy and making
sure that they can continue for another
four years
to undermine living standards destroy
social policy concentrate that wealth in
a very narrow sector of an unusually
corrupt part of the business
establishment as Krugman and many others
have been pointing out and to pursue
that to secure that agenda is very
serious and it is a security problem and
that's about the only security problem
anyone can seem to conjure up but it's
real of course well that's one
interpretation one interpretation will
within the mainstream establishment is
what I just said there's a long-term
goal of regaining control over the
second-largest resources in the Middle
East and ensuring domination of the
greatest one of the greatest material
prizes in world history and a stupendous
source of strategic power September 11th
gave a pretext as it gave a pretext
around the world for intensification of
violence and disciplining of populations
and domestic considerations and that
very important security problem they
probably account for the timing so it
has to be this winter
not the next winter that'll be too late
but then we'll have been consumed by the
mushroom cloud which will avoid everyone
else but it has and the so and of course
it's just kind of like an accident that
that'll be the right in the middle of
the presidential campaign just as it's
an accident that the people of the
region are afraid but mostly of us and
joining much of the world and that well
that's one interpretation there
instantly this all of this is not only
the classic strategy of an endangered
right wing oligarchy under a radical
nationalist leadership as Livan points
out but it's also second nature to the
people in Washington remember that the
people running the show are recycled
Reaganites
almost entirely they come out of the
Reagan administration when they were
doing precisely the same thing I mean
the first thing when they came into
office when the Reagan administration
came into office xx in 1981 first thing
it did was declare a war on terror with
pretty much the same rhetoric just today
at that time Americans had to be
terrified by a Libyan hit men who were
wandering the streets of Washington
planning to kill our leader another
brave cowboy who was hiding in the White
House surrounded by tanks I mean if
you're old enough you'll remember that
or your parents will that was 20 years
ago and they had to be worried about the
Sandinistas who brought two days
marching time from Texas the brave
cowboy told us and they were following a
script the script of mine Kumpf
in their plan to conquer the hemisphere
if not beyond that was George Shultz the
administration and moderate the Colin
Powell of the day and there was a
national emergency called renewed every
year because of the threat to the US
security and survival opposed by people
like that for example by Qaddafi who was
planning to expel America from the world
according to Reagan or at least his
speech writers and people were afraid I
mean this
is traditionally a very frightened
society you can ask about the reasons
but it's well-known Americans happen to
be more frightened than almost anything
then most other people what kind of
historical reasons but it's clearly true
that can be crime you know aliens drugs
you name it there's a lot of fear and
it's it's not hard to stir up fear among
the population and I was going on right
through the eighties so all of this is
absolutely second nature to the guys
making policy today and it wouldn't be
too surprising if that's what they're
planning well my time is just about
running out but which is fun because
there is another view which I can
fortunately skip since there's no time
and that's that's what you hear every
time George Bush or Tony Blair or
someone who supports them reads from
their note cards or maybe makes it up
themselves we can and you're familiar
with that so enough to repeat it the
first and with this it could run through
the argument so if it's necessary but
more interesting in a way is just to
accept all the claims is true so let's
say everything they say is true okay if
you can and run a little experiment it's
pretty easy to show that if the claims
are true there are very simple ways to
meet the announced goals I'm not just
talking about sending back inspectors
there are other ways if you decide that
a war is necessary measures that really
haven't been considered kind of
instructive to ask why but I'll stop
there
what concrete steps would you advocate
the United States do as a superpower to
combat terrorism besides nothing right
well first of all there's no one easy
way to reduce terrorism the easiest
possible way is to stop participating in
it that already that that already that
already reduces it by a very substantial
factor huge in fact right up to the
present I'll give you if you don't know
examples I'll be glad to listen for you
second if to talk about that small much
smaller category of terrorism that's
directed against the West okay and it
exists and it's serious al-qaeda style
terrorism well of course one way to stop
to reduce it is to stop fostering it so
remember where these groups came from
these are the groups that were organized
trained and armed by the CIA back in the
1980s and there are associated still
fulfill for reasons of state they didn't
care about Afghanistan as late as 1993
after the first attempt to blow up the
World Trade Center which came awful
close to succeeding Bill Clinton was
sending al-qaeda members you know at
least Afghan ease after Lana Craddock
Allah some Afghanistan along with a lot
of people flying them to Bosnia to fight
the US side in that war you know one way
to and we can go on with that a Bali
bombing is another case if you want to
look at it closely so another way to
reduce terrorism is to stop fostering
and organizing terrorists around the
world but let's take the attacks against
the United States ok like 9/11 how do
you deal with that well you know one way
of doing it is by bombing Afghanistan
which as far as anyone according to US
intelligence at least had almost no
effect on terrorism and may have
extended it that's US intelligence there
are ways however to reduce threats like
that and we know what they are
they've been carried out for careful
police work so for example primarily in
Germany which is the leader in this
police work hasn't
broken up the very significant al-qaeda
ring and yeah that's the way you deal
with crimes the other way you deal with
them and everyone knows this is by
looking at the grievances you want to
deal with terrorism every serious
scholar the head of every Intelligence
Agency anyone has a their head screwed
on knows that you do with it by looking
at where it comes from
if you want I can quote for you the head
of Israeli Shabbat and the head of
Israeli military intelligence and
leading scholars here and Sonja they all
say the same thing just as Britain
finally found out you want to deal with
IRA terrorism
there's no use wouldn't do any good to
bomb Belfast dirty bomb Boston for
example where the financing came from
what made sense at first they tried
violence that just increased the
Terrorism finally they started paying
some attention and grievances which are
quite real and there's been some
progress and that's true all over so
yeah there are a lot of ways to do with
terrorism but the main way is to stop
participating in it I've reading a
number of articles on this question
whether you know we ought to go to war
or not and I you know I read a piece
that said that you know who seen has
gone into the north and executed a lot
of the Kurdish folks that are up there
and that commits genocide up there and
that the link to terrorism resides with
the fact that he gives $25,000 to the
families of suicide bombers so that
there's a there's a monetary link there
you're asking about a connection it's
those two that he's arm that he's broken
United Nations resolutions undermined
international on that the war with Iran
and Kuwait that he's you know to
stabilize the region and that it's I'm
familiar base for so what is the
question what does one say about those
things yeah okay so let's go through
them so it's perfectly true let's go
back to the main arguments that are
given I mean
every speech of Blair and Bush and the
British the CA or Roth sake the New York
Times couple days ago which had a big
insert taken from the Kennedy School
incidentally from a Kennedy School
research project on crimes of Saddam
Hussein and what was charged is all
correct only one thing is missing in all
of these accusations three little words
with our support okay yep he invaded
Iraq he used chemical weapons in the war
he used gas against what's called his
own people they are the Kurds or his own
people in the sense that the Cherokees
were Andrew Jackson's people but yeah he
used he used gas against the Kurds he
then carried out the unthought onfo
massacre with maybe killed a hundred
thousand of them or so always with the
firm support of the United States and
Britain okay in fact of the people who
are now in charge who don't even have
the minimal decency to say well we did
something wrong what they do is leave
out the words with our support and
everyone who reports that leaves out the
words with our support which continued
including giving him means to develop
weapons of mass destruction missiles
nuclear weapons and biological and
chemical weapons and all that went on
literally up to the day of the invasion
of Kuwait and in fact he did invade
Kuwait when he was a US ally just as he
invaded Iran when he was a US ally so
yeah he committed all of those crimes
and those are by far the worst crimes in
his record with our support the next
worst crimes on his record are in March
1991 after the war right after the Gulf
War when there was a Shiite uprising
which probably would have overthrown it
there were rebelling Iraqi generals who
didn't ask the US first remember that's
time when the US had total control of
the region total know after the war but
the people who are now in Washington
decided to support their old friend
Saddam so they refused to allow
rebelling Iraqi generals access
captured arms they authorized Saddam to
use military helicopters and other
weapons and he killed tens of thousands
more people while they watched and I had
a reason official reason they said the
reason is because we need what's called
stability we don't we want to make sure
that the Iraq doesn't break up it was
explained rather well by the chief
diplomatic correspondent of The New York
Times well and approvingly Thomas
Friedman he said well they said the best
of all worlds for the United States
would be an iron-fisted military hunter
ruling Iraq the same way Saddam did but
with a different name because this one's
kind of embarrassing so that would so
those are its worst crimes by far did he
violate UN resolutions sure you know
he's hardly the only one actually people
point out correctly that Israel's
violated many more but that's missing
the point the if Iraq had the I mean
think for a minute if Iraq had the
capacity to veto Security Council
resolutions it wouldn't be in violation
of any of them I mean the main way to
violate the main way to violate Security
Council resolutions is to veto them and
who's in the lead and vetoing Security
Council resolutions ever since the UN
fell out of control with decolonization
so say since the 1960's well the u.s. is
far in the lead Britain's second nobody
else is even in shouting distance and
it's on all kinds of issues so for
example the u.s. is the only country on
record is vetoing a resolution calling
on all states to observe international
law okay
that was after the u.s. had rejected the
Worldport ruling ordering it to stop its
terrorist attacks against Nicaragua so
yeah there are plenty of countries that
have are in violation of Security
Council resolutions that's true no
nothing let me just add one word because
I forgot to talk about the alleged
$25,000 to the suicide bombers that may
or may not be true I've never seen a
source for it let's say it's true before
there were any suicide bombers was also
reported by the same sources that Saddam
Hussein was giving $10,000 to the
families of anyone who's killed by
Israeli a trip by Israeli atrocities
there are plenty of well should he been
doing that so let's take say the first
month of the current Intifada
I'm just relying now on IDF sources
Israeli army sources what they say is
that in the first few days of the
Intifada the Israeli army fired a
million bullets okay one of the high
military officers said that means one
bullet for every child
within the first month of the Intifada
they killed about 70 people okay using
US helicopters and in fact Clinton
shipped new helicopters to Israel as
soon as they started using them against
civilians that's just the first month
and at that point and it goes on no
suicide bombers at the time it was
reported that Saddam Hussein was giving
ten thousand dollars to every family
those that supporting terror I mean it
seems to me sending helicopters to
Israel when they're using them to attack
apartment complex is that supporting
terror the question I have is I'd like
to know what your thoughts on the are on
the long-term consequences for Arab
cohesion and identity in the area the
long-term consequences of Arab cohesion
and identity in the aftermath of a war
or further an occupation a long-term
occupation of Iraq as an Arab this
concerns me because I'd like to know
what consideration is being given if any
to preserving the identity and
strengthening the nationalism in a
post-war region you're speaking of the
Iraq specifically or the Arab world
start with the people that are going to
get occupied anybody's guess I mean once
you start a war you don't know what's
going to happen I mean there's plenty of
historical evidence on that the CIA
doesn't know Rumsfeld doesn't know I
don't know nobody knows you unleash a
major war all kinds of things can happen
if we look at the historical record for
a guy we know what the US record has
been not only in the Middle
but right close to home Latin America
we've got as a quote at the Kennedy
administration declassified record we've
got a policy of 150 years and we can
look at what that's done so we can take
a look say at the country that has had
the most that's been the beneficiary
let's say of the most US intervention in
the 20th century
ever since Woodrow Wilson invaded namely
Haiti which is the poorest country in
the hemisphere and that goes with
intervention goes right through the 90s
supporting terror in fact the leading
terrorist is now hiding out in Queens in
the US won't extradite him amano
constant head of the group that killed
maybe four thousand people in the early
90s and everyone knows why they won't
extradite him he's going to spill the
beans on u.s. involvement with the
terrorist forces so that's Haiti the
most intervention the second-most
intervention in the 20th century has
been Nicaragua which is now the second
poorest country in the hemisphere vying
with it in second place is Guatemala
which is also vying in second place for
most intervention and we can run through
the record in the Middle East we have a
long record
so in fact again the Declassified record
is extremely illuminating and it again
takes some discipline not to look at it
so George Bush you remember his
plaintive question why do they hate us
because we're so good and so on and so
forth he wasn't the first president to
ask that question that was raised by
President Eisenhower in 1958 in internal
discussion where he discussed with his
staff what he called the campaign of
hatred against us by the people in the
Arab world and the National Security
Council gave an analysis of it and gave
a reasonable answer they said it's based
on the recognition I'm mixing up a
couple of things from 1958 they're not
day-after-day in the 1958 National
Security Council pointed out discuss
what they called the recognition in the
Arab were
that the United States supports harsh
and oppressive regimes and blocks
democracy and development because of our
interest in controlling your East oil
and they recommend it more of the same
and it continues right up to the present
we don't have a Declassified record from
last year but we have a public record so
after September 11th
some of the better journals like Wall
Street Journal to their credit did try
to do some studies of the opinions of
the parts of the Arab world that they
care about the rich people so they had a
study of what they called money Muslims
meaning bankers and you know lawyers and
managers of multinationals and so on all
people who are right involved in the
whole American system you know no
objections to us-style globalization or
anything else and I gave the same
answers as in 1958 they said yeah
there's we admire the United States we
like its values we love its freedom but
we wish you wouldn't deprive us of them
what we oppose is the US policies of
supporting oppressive and brutal
governments and blocking democracy and
development I mean that's now
exacerbated by particular policies that
didn't exist in the 1950s but those are
constant strains and you hear it right
now and you know Pakistan Egypt anywhere
you look the same complaints so is that
a basis for thinking that the democracy
is going to be established well you know
again you can believe in religious
conversion and have blind faith in your
leaders but other than that I don't see
any basis you made an interesting point
in your talk which is that the real
reason we're going into Iraq or the
administration wants to go to Iraq is to
get the oil but that's the this biggest
material prize that exists in the world
and I tend to agree with you one of the
biggest materials one of the things in
world history yeah that's the state
that's not me so if you accept that to
be true which I I do isn't there a
certain calculus that someone who's
sitting in the shoes of a Condoleezza
Rice could make that they're responsible
for the best outcome for American
citizens
and there's an upside of going into Iraq
which is we get this greatest material
possession one of the greatest material
possessions in the world history and
there are downsides which are we upset
the international community and maybe
there's more terrorism and couldn't you
envision a calculus mmm where they say
sure that's the reason and it's a good
reason let's do it what's the flaw in
the calculus no I think that's exactly
their calculus but then we ought to just
be honest and say look we're a bunch of
Nazis so fine let's just drop all the
discussion you know we save a lot of
trees and we know we can throw out the
newspapers and most of the scholarly
literature and just come out state and
straight and total truth you know say
we'll do whatever we want because we
think we're gonna gain by it and
incidentally it's not American citizens
will gain don't gain by this it's narrow
sectors of power domestic power that the
administration is serving with quite
unusual dedication yeah they'll gain so
you know Dick Cheney okay in Halliburton
all games on and so forth
American high-tech industry okay the so
for example one of the ways of recycling
petrodollars is selling arms
now that's misleadingly called the
military-industrial complex but anybody
who looks carefully certainly anybody
who works at MIT where these are
salaries
knows perfectly well that the military
system is kind of a cover for high-tech
industry I mean anyone who's using a
computer or telecommunications or the
internet or you know gets benefits from
automation or containerization or you
just name it I mean it's all a lot of
it's coming out of the state sector of
the economy which is very dynamic and
innovative and it operates under the
cover of military spending quite often
but yeah so there's kind of gains that
sort of dribble down but if that's what
we're interested in fine let's just say
it's they're all aligned could you
please discuss the doctrine of box
Americana as an organizing principle for
u.s. foreign policy
well you're referring for example to the
national security strategy report from a
month
it was a pretty brazen statement and
it's part of the reason why much of the
world including Europe regards the
United States as a menace to itself and
the world and it frightened the
Europeans and others well yeah and if
you think about it Colin Powell pointed
out in a press conference right
afterwards there wasn't all that new and
that even the preemptive strike doctrine
he said was not all that new and he was
correct
it's an old principle and the US didn't
invent it of course it's just the u.s.
is by far the most powerful state so
when it proposes it it means something
about you can trace it right back to the
time when the u.s. became a major global
power after the Second World War before
that it was also true but in the region
that's called them under a doctrine and
faith it goes back to the in fact when
Kennedy John F Kennedy forty years ago
ordered his staff to unleash the terrors
of the earth against Cuba escalating
already ongoing international terrorist
campaign the reason was that he could
read it in the Declassified record now
the reason was that the very existence
of the Castro regime was a successful
defiance of the United States and of a
policy of a hundred and fifty years that
the United States had been following
namely it was the existence of a regime
which was not following US orders and
they traced it back 150 years so
therefore we had to carry out a major
terrorist campaign that goes right into
the 1990s so yeah Colin Powell's correct
it's not new and furthermore it's even
on the public record you don't have to
go to the declassified record so if we
go back again in 40 years and some
talking with the Kennedy School to the
Kennedy administration in 1962 and 62 or
63 right about then 62 I think a senior
statesman and Dean Acheson and senior
Kennedy advisor gave an important speech
to the American Society of international
ball he was talking about the US
economic warfare against Cuba which was
widely recognized as illegal and by now
every
every relevant body including even the
normally compliant Organization of
American States has declared it to be
illegal about what and at the time the
terrorist war was already underway but
it wasn't that public except of course
Cubans who knew all about it but the
what he told the American Society of
international law that in the case of
the in the case of a US response that he
said that no legal I'm quoting it now no
legal issue arises no legal issue in the
case of a US response to a challenge to
its power position or prestige okay that
actually goes beyond the Bush Doctrine
announced a month ago and that's the
other end of the spectrum that's the
Kennedy administration okay and that was
public like it's not secret it's the
American Society of international law
and there are plenty of examples in
between the same sort of pre-emptive
strikes so the idea of a pre-emptive
nuclear strike which was kind of
announced you know those words but
everyone understands it in the so-called
Bush Doctrine it's also a Clinton
doctrine the have a look at a major
study major study of Clinton Strategic
Command which is from 1995 it's called
essentials of post Cold War deterrence
partially Declassified it it's the major
document sort of working out a post cold
war strategy one of the things it
advocates is what it calls pre-emptive
response nice phrase think about it
pre-emptive response including nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear states that
have signed the non-proliferation treaty
if considered necessary okay it also
explains the background it says we have
to convey a national persona of being
irrational and vindictive that they say
will frighten people in the professional
literature of political science and
international relations is a term for it
it's called establishing credibility
that's very important you got to
establish credibility you know you
I know if that means ask your
neighborhood and mafia don explained to
you what it means you don't just collect
protection money from somebody if they
don't pay you certainly don't ask for a
court order for it what you do is beat
them to a pulp that establishes
credibility then others know who's boss
and that's the way international
relations work - so yeah there's a
direct precedent there and you can trace
it back quite far I'm gonna ask take the
prerogative the chair and ask the last
question if you believed that Saddam
Hussein had biological chemical and
nuclear weapons and was imminently
going to use them perhaps not on us but
on his neighbors and with the with the
potential of killing tens if not
hundreds of thousands of people would
there be any circumstances that you
would agree that it would be worthwhile
for the u.s. to use military force
against him nobody in the region is
worried about it isn't that a little
surprising I mean quaked and Iran for
example both of them invaded by Saddam
when he was our ally they're not calling
for the use of military force in fact
they're opposing it the the only country
in the region that's calling for
military forces Israel and they have
their own reasons the the only people
who seem to be afraid of this
possibility in fact even Israeli
military intelligence the head of
Israeli military intelligence recently
announced that he doesn't and there they
watch it pretty closely that they don't
see any nuclear threat from Iraq maybe
four or five years from now but not in
the near future I'm strongly opposed to
allowing Iraq to develop nuclear weapons
that's why when George Bush and number
one and his cohorts were providing
assistance to Saddam in developing
nuclear weapons I was writing against it
and opposing it give you the citations
if you want that's 1990 1998 989 1988
yeah I was strongly opposing the US and
British efforts at the time to provide
Saddam with the means of developing
weapons of mass destruction it was
horrifying
and I certainly wouldn't want it to
happen now and if we're interested in
stopping it yeah everybody knows the way
he'd get inspectors back certainly for
nuclear weapons that's gonna work maybe
not for everything else but just think
for a second suppose suppose I had
nuclear weapons in my backyard for
instance could I would it be a threat to
anyone
or would it be the turn only under one
condition that I let people know I had
them okay if they're hidden in my garage
then either a threaten or a deterrent
right everybody knows this if Saddam
Hussein in the extremely unlikely
contingency that he'll develop nuclear
weapons if they were to be usable for
every anything he'd have to let people
know he had him well the minute there's
a hint that he has them Iraq gets
obliterated okay suppose there was any
move made towards using them well you
know they get obliterated squared that's
why the people in the region apart from
not believing it aren't afraid of it and
why they're afraid of the United States
there are reasons for there plenty of
things to be worried about so for
example loose nukes getting into the
hands of terrorists that's a problem
it's not a new one that predates
September 11th as I mentioned you can
read technical papers in the literature
for example in the journal International
Security you know four or five years ago
pointing out that the sort of quoting
close to quoting now that is weighty for
9/11 that the quote actually exciting
government studies which showed that
which conclude that a well planned
effort to smuggle of weapons of mass
destruction meaning nuclear weapons into
the United States would have a 90%
probability of success far higher than
any missile attack with or without
national missile defense that's like
four or five years ago if you want a
guidebook for terrorists one was
published about four years ago by MIT
press I called America's Achilles heel
by three well-known strategic analysts
who pointed out all kinds of ways in
which terrorists could you know people
with my
limited capacity could carry out major
terrorist attacks in the United States
those things have really problems and
they're not new we've all known about
them since 1993 at least I remember in
1993 the offshoots of the groups that
were organized by the US and Afghanistan
and the 80s almost blew up the World
Trade Center plus the FBI building plus
the UN buildings plus the tunnels under
the river they had ambitious plans
according to the World Trade Center
building engineers if they had a little
better planning they would have killed
tens of thousands of people these are
not new threats you know I mean it's
been owned by everyone for years there's
read the newspapers to know if you read
the technical literature it's been all
over those are problems and if we're
serious about trying to prevent say
nuclear explosions in New York by the
way you do it is by going after the
loose no problem and we know where the
problem lies it lies in the former
Soviet Union and in Pakistan and in
other places where there's a very weak
supervision over nuclear weapons are we
doing anything about it
no virtually nothing I mean very limited
funding to try to do something about it
the latest treaty so-called which isn't
really a treaty it's a Memorandum of
Understanding between bush between
Russia and the United States on nuclear
weapons there's nothing it was already
planned and it provides for no
supervision same is true of biological
weapons so for example just October 23rd
like just a week ago the first committee
of the United Nations which is basically
the General Assembly passed two
resolutions one resolution calling for
reaffirmation of the 1925 Geneva
Convention opposing the use of banning
the use of chemical weapons and the
second was effectively reaffirmation of
the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 which
bans the placing weapons in outer space
which will
call nuclear-weapons pest almost
unanimously to countries opposed the
united states and israel the u.s.
carried out its opposition the way it
usually does in these committees but
disarmament committees by abstaining and
a u.s. abstention like a veto is in fact
that double veto for one thing it kills
the proposal and for another thing it
bans it from access to the public so
there wasn't a single mention of this in
any newspaper in the united states a
friend a database search which is normal
to it usually works on the assumption i
guess that it's not a good idea to let
citizens know of what's being done to
end biology is only experiment with
higher intelligence this goes on all the
time
but those are real threats i mean if we
oppose just shortly before that the u.s.
opposed any steps any steps even ten
years in the future to add some
enforcement devices to the biological
weapons treaty that the us at the last
minute refused to ratify endorsed yeah
those are real threats you know we won't
do something about them yeah put teeth
in and carry out our responsibilities
under the non-proliferation treaty which
we sign non-proliferation treaty commits
those who have nuclear weapons to
good-faith efforts to get rid of them
okay put teeth in that and stop
stimulating the proliferation of nuclear
weapons as Kenneth waltz pointed out by
countries are going to feel they need
them as an ignorant yeah those are all
concrete things that we can do to
increase our own security thank you very
much professor Chomsky
you
