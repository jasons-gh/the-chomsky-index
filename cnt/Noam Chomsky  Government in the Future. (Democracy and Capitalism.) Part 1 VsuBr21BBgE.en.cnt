the sound seminar you're about to hear
was recruited at the poetry center of
the New York ym YW h a on februari 16
1970 this program presents Noam Chomsky
speaking on government in the future
here is noam chomsky I think it's useful
to set up as a framework for discussion
for somewhat idealized positions with
regard to the role of the state in an
advanced industrial society I want to
call these positions first classical
liberal second libertarian socialist
third state socialist for state
capitalist and I want to consider each
in turn also I'd like to make clear my
own point of view in advance so you can
evaluate and judge what I'm saying I
think that the libertarian socialist
concepts and by that I mean a range of
thinking that extends from left-wing
Marxism through anarchism I think that
these are fundamentally correct and that
they are the proper and natural
extension of classical liberalism into
the era of advanced industrial society
in contrast it seems to me that the
ideology of state socialism that is what
has become of Bolshevism and of state
capitalism the modern welfare state
these of course are dominant in the
industrial countries in the industrial
societies but I believe that they are
regressive and highly inadequate social
theories and that will end a large
number of our really fundamental
problems stem from a kind of
incompatibility and inappropriate pneus
of these social forms to a modern
industrial society well then let me
consider these four points of reference
in sequence beginning with the classical
liberal point of view classical
liberalism assert says it's major idea
an opposition to all but the most
restrictive minimal forms of state
dimension and personal or social life
well this conclusion is quite familiar
however the reasoning that leads to it
is less familiar and I think a good deal
more important than the conclusion
itself
one of the earliest and most brilliant
expositions of this position is in
vilhelm von humboldt limits of state
action which was written in 1792 though
not published for 60 or 70 years after
that in his view the state tends to
quote tends to make an instrument to
make man an instrument to serve its
arbitrary ends overlooking his
individual purposes and Vince man is in
his essence of free searching self
perfecting beam it follows that the
state is a profoundly at a human
institution that is its actions its
existence are altima tlie incompatible
with the full harmonious development of
human potential in its richest diversity
hence incompatible with what humboldt
and in the following century marks
Bakunin mill and many others what they
see is the true end of man and for the
record I think that this is an accurate
description the modern conservative
tends to regard himself as the lineal
descendant of the classical liberal in
this sense but I think that that can be
maintained an extremely superficial
point of view as one can see by studying
more carefully the fundamental ideas of
classical libertarian thought as
expressed in my opinion in its most
profound form by by by humboldt i think
the issues are of really quite
considerable contemporary significance
and if you don't mind they what may
appear to be a somewhat antiquarian
excursion i'd like to expand on them for
Humboldt as for Rousseau and before him
the Cartesian man's essential attribute
is his freedom quote to inquire and to
create these are the centers around
which all human pursuits more or less
directly revolve but he goes on to say
all morrow cultures spring solely and
immediately from the inner life of the
soul and can never be produced by
external and artificial control nemesis
the cultivation of the understanding as
of any of man's other faculties is
gnarly achieved by his own activity his
own ingenuity or his own methods of
using the discoveries of others well
from these assumptions quite obviously
an educational theory follows and he
develops it but I won't pursue it but
also far more fellows
Humboldt goes on to develop at least the
rudiments of a theory of exploitation
and of alienated labor that suggests in
significant ways i think the early marks
so i mean combo pack continues these
comments that I made Leah that I quoted
about the cultivation of understanding
through spontaneous action in the
following way he says man never regards
what he possesses as so much his own as
what he does and the laborer who tends a
garden is perhaps in a truer sense its
owner than the lip and the listless
voluptuary who enjoys its fruits and
since truly human action is that which
flows from inner impulse it seems as if
all peasants and craftsmen might be
elevated into artists that is men who
love their labor for its own sake
improve it by their own plastic genius
and inventive skill and thereby
cultivate their intellect and oval their
character and exhaustion refine their
pleasures and so humanity would be a
noble by the very things which now
though beautiful and themselves so often
tend to degrade it freedom is
undoubtedly the indispensable condition
without which even the pursuits most
congenial to individual human nature can
never succeed in producing such salutary
influences whatever does not spring from
a man's free choice or is only the
result of instruction and guidance does
not enter into his very being but
remains alien to his true nature he does
not perform it with truly human energies
but merely with mechanical exactness and
if a man acts in a mechanical way
reacting to external demands or
instruction rather than in ways
determined by his own interests and
energies and power he says we may admire
what he does but we despise what he is
for Humboldt and man is born to inquire
and create and when a man or a child
chooses to inquire or create out of his
own free choice then he becomes in his
own terms an artist rather than a tool
of production or a well trained parrot
this is the essence of his concept of
human nature and I think it's very
revealing and interesting to compare it
with marks with his early of the early
marks manuscripts in particular his
account of quote the alienation of labor
when work is external to the worker not
part of his nature so that he does not
fulfill himself in his work but denies
himself and is physically exhausted and
mentally the based this alienated labor
that casts some of the workers back into
a barbarous kind of work and turns
others into machines thus depriving man
of his species character of free
conscious activity and productive life
recall also Marx's well known and often
quoted reference to a higher form of
society in which labor has become not
only a means of life but also the
highest want in life and recall also his
repeated criticism of the specialized
labor which quote again mutilates the
worker into a fragment of a human being
degrades him to become a mirror of
pertinence of the machine makes his work
such a torment that it's essential
meaning is destroyed estranges from him
the intellectual potentialities of the
labor process in a proportion to the
extent to which science has incorporated
into it as an independent power Robert
Tucker for one has rightly emphasized
that Marx sees the revolutionary more as
a frustrated producer than as a
dissatisfied consumer and this far more
radical critique of capitalist relations
of production flows directly often in
the same words from the libertarian
thought of the Enlightenment for this
reason I think one must stay that
classical liberal ideas in their essence
though not in the way they developed are
profoundly anti-capitalist the essence
of these ideas must be destroyed for
them to serve as an ideology of modern
industrial capitalism writing in the
1780s and early 1790s Humboldt had no
conception of the forms that industrial
capitalism would take consequently in
this classic of classical liberalism he
stresses the problem of limiting state
power and he's not overly concerned with
the dangers of private power the reason
is that he believes in and speaks of
essentially quality of condition of
private citizens of course he has no
idea writing in 1790 of the ideas of the
ways in which the notion private person
would come to be reinterpreted in the
era of corporate capitalism he did not
Percy I now quote the anarchist
historian Rudolf rocker he did not
percy that democracy with its model
Equality of all citizens before the law
and liberalism with its right of man
over his own person both would be
wrecked on the realities of capitalist
economy boom bolt did not perceive that
Ana predatory capitalist economy state
intervention would be an absolute
necessity to preserve human existence to
prevent the destruction of the physical
environment I speak optimistically of
course as Karl Polanyi 41 has pointed
out the self-adjusting market could not
exist for any length of time without
annihilating the human and natural
substance of society it would have
physically destroyed man and transformed
to surroundings into a wilderness I
think that's correct Humboldt also did
not foresee the consequences of the
commodity character of Labor the
doctrine again in Alana's words that it
is not for the commodity to decide where
it should be offered for sale to what
purpose it should be used at what prices
should be allowed to change hands in
what manner it should be consumed or
destroyed but the commodity in this case
of course a human life and social
protection was there for a minimal
necessity to constrain the irrational
and destructive workings of the
classical free market nor did Humboldt
understand the nineteen seven in 1790
that capitalist economic relations
perpetuate the form of bondage which
long before that in fact as early as
1767 C Mullen gay had the Clinton to be
even worse than slavery writing it is
the impossibility of living by any other
means that compels our farm laborers to
till the soil fruits they will not eat
and our Mason's to construct buildings
in which they will not live it is one
that drags them to those markets where
they await masters who will do them the
kindness of buying it is once that
compels them to go down on their knees
to the rich man in order to get from him
permission to enrich him what effective
gain has the suppression of slavery
brought him he's free you say that is
his misfortune these men that have said
have no master they have one and the
most terrible the most imperious of
masters that is need is this that
reduces to the most cruel dependence and
if there is something degrading to human
nature in the idea of bondage as every
spokesman for the Enlightenment
insist then it would follow that a new
emancipation must be awaited what
Fourier referred to as the third and
last emancipatory phase of history the
first having made serfs out of slaves
the second wage earners out of serfs and
the third which will transform the
proletariat freemen by eliminating the
commodity character of labor ending wage
slavery and bringing the commercial
industrial and financial institutions
under Democratic control these are all
things that Humboldt in his classical
liberal doctrine did not express and
didn't see but I think he might have
accepted these conclusions he does for
example and Rick agree that state
intervention in social life is
legitimate if freedom would destroy the
very conditions without which not only
freedom but even existence itself would
be inconceivable which are precisely the
circumstances that arise in an
unconstrained capitalist economy and he
does as in the remarks that I quoted
vigorously condemned the alienation of
labor the event his criticism of
bureaucracy and the autocratic state
stands as a very eloquent forewarning of
some of the most dismal aspects of
modern history and the important point
is that the basis of his critique is
applicable to a far broader range of
coercive institutions than he imagined
in particular to the institutions of
industrial capitalism though he
expresses a classical liberal doctrine
Humboldt is a primitive individualist in
the style of for example Russo Joe Russo
of tolls the savage who lives within
himself but Humboldt vision is entirely
different he sums up his remarks as
follows he says the whole tenor of the
ideas and arguments unfolded in this
essay might fairly be reduce to this
that while they would break all fetters
in human society they would attempt to
find as many new social bonds as
possible the isolated man is no more
able to develop than the one who is
fettered and he in fact looks forward to
a community of Free Association without
coercion by the state or other
authoritarian institutions in which
freemen can create and inquire achieve
the highest development of their powers
fact far ahead of his time he presents
an anarchist vision that is appropriate
perhaps to the next stage of industrial
dieting we can perhaps look forward to a
day when these various strands will be
brought together within the framework of
libertarian socialism a social form that
barely exists today though its elements
can perhaps be perceived for example in
the guarantee of individual rights that
has achieved so far its fullest
realization though still tragically
flawed in the Western democracies or in
the Israeli cuisine or in the
experiments with workers councils in
Yugoslavia or an effort to awaken
popular consciousness and to create a
new involvement in the social process
which is a fundamental element in the
third world revolutions coexisting
uneasily with indefensible authoritarian
practice so I mean summarized its first
point the first concept of the state
that i want to set up as a point of
reference classical liberal its doctrine
is that the state functions should be
drastically limited but this familiar
characterization is a very superficial
one more deeply the classical liberal
view develops from a certain concept of
human nature one that stresses the
importance of diversity and free
creation and therefore this view is in
fundamental opposition to industrial
capitalism its wage slavery it's
alienated labor and its hierarchic and
authoritarian principles of social and
economic organization at least in its
multi inform classical liberal thought
is opposed as well to the concepts of
possessive individualism which are
intrinsic to capitalist ideology so it
seeks to eliminate social fetters but to
replace them by social bonds not by
competitive greed not by predatory
individualism not of course by corporate
Empire State or private classical
libertarian thought seems to me
therefore to lead directly to
libertarian socialism or anarchism if
you like when combined with an
understanding of industrial capitalism
well the second point of reference that
I want to discuss is the libertarian
socialist vision of the state a French
writer rather sympathetic to anarchism
once wrote that anarchism has a broad
back like paper it ensures anything and
there are many shades
mannerism and I'm concerned here only
with one namely the anarchism of bakunin
who wrote in his anarchist manifesto of
1865 that the anon arcust one must first
be a socialist I'm concerned with the
anarchism of Adolf Fisher one of the
martyrs of the Haymarket affair in 1886
who said that every anarchist is a
socialist but not every socialist is
necessarily an anarchist a consistent
anarchist must oppose private ownership
of the means of production such property
is indeed as LaVon is famous remark
asserted a form theft but a consistent
anarchist will also oppose the
organization of production by government
I'm quoting it means state socialism the
command of the state officials over
production and the command of managers
scientists shop officials in the shop
the goal of the working class is
liberation from expectation and this
goal has not reached and cannot be
reached by a new directing and governing
class substituting itself for the
bourgeoisie it is only realised by the
workers themselves being master over
production by some form of workers
councils these remarks that happens are
quoted from the left-wing Marxist and
pound panic cook and in fact radical
Marxism what Lenin once called infantile
Walter leftism merges with anarchist
currents there's an important point I
think and let me give one further
illustration of this convergence between
left-wing Marxism and socialist
anarchism consider it the following
characterization of revolutionary
socialism the revolutionary socialist
denies the state ownership can end in
anything other than a bureaucratic
despotism we have seen why the state
cannot democratically control industry
industry can only be democratically
owned and controlled by the workers
elected directly from their own ranks
Industrial administrative committees
socialism will be fundamentally an
industrial system it's constituencies
will be of an industrial character thus
those carrying on the social activity
and industries of society will be
directly represented in the local and
central councils of social
administration in this way the powers of
such delegates will flow upwards from
those carrying on the work and
conversing with the needs of the
community
when the central administrative
industrial committee meets it will
represent every phase of social activity
hence the capitalist political or
geographical state will be replaced by
the industrial administrative committee
of socialism the transition from one
social system to the other will be the
social revolution the political state
throughout history has meant the
government of men by ruling classes the
Republic of socialism will be the
government of industry administered on
behalf of the whole community the former
meant the economic and political
subjection of the many the latter will
mean the economic freedom of all it will
be there for a true democracy these
remarks are taken from a book called the
state its origins and function written
by William Paul in early nineteen
seventeen just prior to Lenin state and
revolution which is his most libertarian
work winning Paul was one founders of
the British Communist Party later the
editor the British Communist Party
journal and it's interesting that his
critique of state socialism resembles
very closely i thank the libertarian
doctrine of the anarchists in particular
in its principle that the state must
disappear to be replaced by the
industrial organization of society in
the course of the social revolution
itself ferdinand 1851 wrote that what we
put in place of the government is
industrial organization and many many
similar comments can be cited that in a
sense as the fundamental idea of
anarchist revolutionaries what's more
important than the fact that many such
statements can be cited is that these
ideas have been realized in spontaneous
revolutionary action several times for
example in Germany and Italy after the
First World War in Catalonia in 1936 one
might argue I at least I would argue
that council communism in this sense and
sensible long quotation that I read is
the natural form of revolutionary
socialism in an industrial society it
reflects the intuitive understanding
that democracy is largely a sham when
the industrial system is controlled by
any form of autocratic elite whether of
owners managers technocrats a vanguard
party to state bureaucracy or whatever
under these conditions of authoritarian
domination the classical liberal ideals
which are expressed also by Marx and
Baku
true revolutionaries cannot be realized
man well in other words not be free to
inquire and create to develop his own
potentialities to their fullest the
worker will remain a fragment of a human
being degraded a tool in the productive
process directed from above the ideas of
revolutionary libertarian socialism in
this sense they've been submerged in the
industrial societies of the past century
the dominant ideologies have been those
of state socialism and state capitalism
but there's been an interesting
resurgence in the last couple of years
fact the theses that I quoted from Anton
penacook they were taken from a recent
pamphlet of a radical French workers
group and the quotation that I read from
William Paul and revolutionary socialism
was taken from a paper by Walter Kendall
at the National Conference on workers
control in Sheffield England last March
both of these groups the French and the
English one represents something
significant the workers control movement
in England in particular has developed
into a I think remarkably significant
force in the last few years it includes
some of the largest trade unions for
example the amalgamated engineering
Federation which i think is the
second-largest trading in England and
which has taken these principles as its
fundamental ideas it's had a series of
successful conferences putting out an
interesting pamphlet literature and on
the continent there are parallel
developments may 1968 in France of
course accelerated the growing interest
in council communism and similar ideas
other forms of libertarian socialism in
France and Germany as it did in England
given the general conservative cast of
our highly ideological society it's not
too surprising that the United States is
relatively untouched by these currents
but that too may change the erosion of
the Cold War mythology at least makes it
possible to discuss some of these
questions and if the present wave of
repression can be beaten back if the
left can overcome it's more suicidal
tendencies and build on the achievements
of the past decade the problem of how to
organize industrial society on truly
democratic lines with democratic control
in the workplace as well as in the
commune
this should become the dominant
intellectual issue for those who are
alive to the problems of contemporary
society and there's a mass movement for
revolutionary libertarian socialism
develops as I hope it will speculation
should proceed to action now may seem
quixotic to group left Marxism and
anarchism under the same rubric as I've
done given the antagonism throughout the
past century between marxists and
anarchists beginning with the antagonism
between marks and angles on the one hand
and for example crude on Bakunin on the
other in the 19th century at least their
differences with regard to the question
of the state was significant but in a
sense it was tactical the anarchists
were convinced that capitalism and the
state must be destroyed together angles
in a letter of 1883 expressed his
opposition to this idea as follows the
anarchists put the thing upside down
they declare that the proletarian
revolution must begin by doing away with
the political organization of the state
but the destroyer moment would be to
destroy the only organism by means of
which the victorious proletariat can
assert its newly conquered power hold
down its adversaries and carry out that
economic revolution of society without
which the whole victory must end in a
new defeat and a mass slaughter of the
workers similar to those after Paris
Commune the Paris Commune I think it's
fair to say did represent the ideas of
libertarian socialism of anarchism if
you like and marks of course wrote about
it with great enthusiasm he in fact the
experience of the commune led him to
modify his concept for the role of the
state as you can see for example by
looking at the introduction to the
communist manifesto the addition of it
was published in eighteen seventy two
and to take on something like a more
anarchist perspective of the nature of
social revolution well the commune was
of course drowned in blood as the
anarchist communes of Spain were
destroyed by fascist and communist
armies and it might be argued that more
dictatorial structures would have
defended the revolution against such
forces but I doubt this worth much at
least in the case of Spain seems to me
that a more consistent libertarian
policy might have provided the only
possible defense of the revolution of
course this can be contested and it's a
long story which I want to go into
here but at the very least it's clear
that one would have to be rather naive
after the events of the past half
century to fail to see the truth in Baku
nuns repeated warnings that the red
bureaucracy would prove the most vile
and terrible lie of the century he once
said take the most radical revolutionary
and place him on the throne of all the
russias to roll russia said in 1870 or
give him a dictatorial power and before
a year has passed he will become worse
than those are himself I'm afraid in
this respect bakunin was all too
perceptive and this kind of warning was
repeatedly voiced from the from the left
for example the anarcho-syndicalist for
non peluche asked 1890s must even the
transitory state to which we have to
submit necessarily and fatally be the
collectivist jail can't it consists in a
free organization limited exclusively by
the needs of production and consumption
all political institutions having
disappeared I don't pretend to know the
answer to that question but I think it's
tolerably clear that unless the answer
is positive the chances for a truly
democratic revolution that will achieve
the humanistic ideals of the left or
perhaps rather slight I think Martin
Buber put the problem quite succinctly
when he said one can up in the nature of
things expect a little tree that has
been turned into a club to put forth
leaves for just this reason it's
essential that a powerful revolutionary
movement exists in the United States if
there are to be any reasonable
possibilities for Democratic social
change of a radical sort any within a
capitalist world and comparable remarks
I think undoubtedly hold for the Russian
Empire Lynn until the end of his life
stressed the idea I quote that it is an
elementary truth of Marxism that the
victory of socialism requires the joint
effort of workers in a number of
advanced countries a very least it
requires that the great centers of World
imperialism be impeded by domestic
pressures from counter-revolutionary
intervention only such possibilities
will permit any revolution to overthrow
its own coercive state institutions as
it over as it tries to bring the economy
under direct Democratic control well let
me somewhere
briefly again I've mentioned so far two
reference points for a discussion of the
state classical liberalism and
libertarian socialism they're in
agreement that the functions of the
state are repressive and that state
action must be limited the libertarian
socialist goes on to insist that the
state power must be eliminated in favor
of the democratic organization of
industrial society with direct popular
control over all institutions by those
who participate in as well as those who
are directly affected by the workings of
these institutions so one might imagine
an a system of workers councils
consumers councils communist em bleeze
regional Federation's and so on with the
kind of representation that's directed
revocable in the sense that
representatives are directly answerable
to and returned directly to the
well-defined and integrated social group
which they speak in some higher order
organization something obviously very
different than our system of
representation now it might very well be
asked whether such a social structure is
feasible in a complex highly
technological society there are counter
arguments and I think they fall into two
main categories first category is that
such an organization is contrary to
human nature and the second category
says roughly that it's incompatible with
the demands of efficiency and I'd like
to briefly consider each of these
consider the first that a free society
is contrary to human nature it's often
asked the men really want freedom do
they want the responsibility that goes
with it or would they prefer to be ruled
by a benevolent master consistently
apologists for the existing distribution
of power have held to one or another
version of the idea of the happy slave
