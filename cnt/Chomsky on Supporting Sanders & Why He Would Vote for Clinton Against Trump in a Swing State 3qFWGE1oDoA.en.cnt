than our guests for the hour noam
chomsky the world-renowned political
dissident linguist author professor
emeritus of linguistics at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology his latest book
who rules the world so that's an
interesting question for 2016 since the
president of United States occupies a
very powerful role in the world gnome
who do you support well before answering
that let me just make one comment on
elections they're important it doesn't
matter who sits in the White House who's
who appoint Supreme Court justices who
makes decisions about war and peace
about environment and so on matters
who's and Congress matters who's in the
state legislatures and so on it matters
but it's not the main issue we are kind
of indoctrinated here into focusing all
of our attention on energy on where what
button we push on in in November every
couple of years which is not
insignificant but not the main issue the
main issue what is what are the forces
domestic forces that are pressuring
acting to determine the kind of choices
that will be made legislation will be
passed and so on now of course there's
one force that's always going to be
there private
concentrated capital corporate power
lobbyists as corporate lawyers and so on
writing legislations suddenly they're
always funding the elections they'll
always be there the question is is there
going to be a countervailing force is
there going to be a force representing
popular interests needs and concerns
defending themselves against what in
fact is a standard class-based assault
against them
now elections can be used as a way of
galvanizing and mobilizing the kinds of
groups which will could become
persistent
dedicated growing constant forces that
influence significantly what's done in
the White House and Congress the New
Deal legislation of Roosevelt for
example wouldn't have been passed it
wouldn't have even been initiated
without militant labor action and other
political action can't wait and that
those are lessons to remember but now
going back to who should you push the
button for well my own in the primaries
I would prefer Bernie Sanders if Clinton
is nominated and it comes to a choice
between Clinton and Trump in a swing
state a state where it's going to matter
which way you vote I would hold I would
vote against Trump and by elementary
arithmetic that means you hold your nose
and you vote Democrat I don't think
there's any other rational choice
abstaining from voting or say voting for
say a candidate you prefer minority
candidate it just amounts to a vote for
Donald Trump which i think is a
devastating prospect for reasons I've
already mentioned so but meanwhile
through the important things the
significance of the Senators campaign
which is pretty remarkable I think it
certainly surprised me it's not radical
in Sanders himself is pretty much a
traditional New Deal Democrat I don't
say that in criticism that doesn't
pretend to be anything else and that's a
breath of fresh air in the current
generally right-wing climate but the
importance of it is if it can be used
the energy and enthusiasm that's been
organized and mobilized can be used to
develop an ongoing popular movement
which will be a powerful force no matter
who's in office to influence and direct
the country in ways that are
absolutely necessary even for survival
at this point that's my view of it um do
you think there's any possibility that
bernie sanders could the man you prefer
the candidate you prefer could be the
candidate it's possible I guess I mean
I've been I should say I've been wrong
all along both about Sanders and Trump
I never thought either of them we get
anywhere I was in good company and
making those predictions but they were
wrong and it could be wrong again
but I think the probabilities are there
isn't a lot of point speculating we'll
we'll see how you know we can try to
reach the conclusions we want the
outcomes we want and what did what do
you think Donald Trump is tapping into
and what do you think of his statements
you know waffling on whether he would
disavow support of the known Klan leader
David Duke the avowed white supremacists
saying that no Muslims can come into
this country whether or not he wins what
effect will this have well I think I
should say this is not new this is
something that's been around for a long
time he's brought it into open view but
it's been there about probably 15 years
ago early two-thousands and a book of
mine I quoted an article interesting
article it's worth going back and
reading by one of the leading historians
of modern Germany for its turn it
appeared in the main establishment
journal Foreign Affairs wasn't secret it
was called something like descent into
barbarism and of his discussion of how
Germany which in the 1920s had been the
peak of Western civilization a decade
later was the absolute depths of human
history and how did it descend into
barbarism
he discusses it and he says very it's
clear what he has in mind
he pointedly says that he has concerns
about the country that rescue that that
gave him refuge from Nazi Germany and
every point that he makes is that this
is an oblique reference to what was
happening in the United States 15 years
ago these these are deep elements of
u.s. society but the appeal of Trump is
not only to racism which is very
profound ultra-nationalism which is very
profound fear it's one of the most
terrified countries in the world has
been through much of its history part of
the reason for the extraordinary gun
culture it's not only that he is also
appealing to pretty much the same kind
of things that Sanders is appealing to
in his case it has been mostly the white
working-class we had five seconds oh but
he's appealing to the fact that people
have just been cast aside by the
neoliberal assault of the past
generation no look we're going to
continue this conversation in post show
and we're going to post an online and
play it on the air at democracynow.org
