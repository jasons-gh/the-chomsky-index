this is the kind of question that's
asked in US policy circles and academic
circles all the time what can the u.s.
do to help okay there is something
called the Hippocratic oath when you
stopped doing harm then you can ask the
question what can we do to help and
there's a long way to go before we get
to that this these results that you
mentioned are on the front page every
day I should take a look at this
morning's newspapers New York time lead
story in the New York Times this morning
it's very interesting what it tells us
about the culture in which we live
Americans that is Harvard you know high
culture it's a discussion of the fact
that the drone attacks killed
inadvertently killed an American hostage
an Italian hostage and that's a big
issue because we're not supposed to kill
Americans and Italians it's a huge
discussion about it what about killing
the people who live there there's no
question at all about that the drum
campaign is the most extraordinary
global terrorist campaign that has ever
been envisioned
I mean suppose that Iran had a campaign
in which they were assassinating people
all over the world who they suspected
might want to harm Iran so for example
they could start with the editors of the
New York Times and The Washington Post
who have just run articles not know
needed to suspect they've run lead
article off Ed's calling for the
immediate bombing of Iran so we know
they're planning to harm Iran so let's
kill him I suppose they were doing that
all over the place what would we think
well we wouldn't have to bother thinking
does it be a nuclear war but when the US
does it it's fine no criticism the drone
campaign officially officially my words
is attacking suspects
people suspected of maybe wanting to
harm the United States someday Obama's
meetings you know whatever they are
Tuesday morning meetings decide who we
want to kill today who is on our kill
list a suspect who we think might want
to harm us and this goes on without
virtually no comment the only comment is
about killing an American that's a
problem or what's called collateral
damage when you attack a village and
with a drone and you kill somebody and
half a dozen other people standing
around they get killed too that's
collateral damage and that's considered
a kind of a problem so there are studies
of how much collateral damage there is
and that's not so good now but what
about killing the suspect I mean this
happens to be the 800th year of
commemoration of Magna Carta it's great
contribution was it was limited but it
established the principle of presumption
of innocence that a person cannot be
harmed and less fried by a character had
a due process and a trial by peers
another the cont this comes up in the
discussions at this morning's times for
example there's a claim by the US
government that the suspects have due
process because they're they are
considered in the executive branch of
the United States government the United
States government considers whether
there are proper targets for
assassination
so that's due process that's the
position of the US government for
liberal government for liberal Justice
Department and there is no comment about
this I mean try to find it it's just
considered fine if we want to kill
anyone we suspect this may be some of
the harming us why shouldn't we and this
is considered really great because it
doesn't put Americans at risk just kills
other people's or what could be better
now there is the problem of
that you mentioned it creates terrorists
it's a terrorist generating system and
that's very well known in high places
all kind of commentary about it and the
reason is pretty obvious you bomb a
village in Yemen you murder some guy who
may may or may not be the guy you were
trying to kill kill a bunch of other
people across the street it inspires a
desire for revenge in fact that's one of
the reasons why the United States is the
most feared country in the world things
like this and we we Americans are
responsible for it we accept it we
tolerate it it's right in the peak of
the intellectual culture Harvard
University no protests about it accepted
and it is it does have these negative
effects of generating more terrorists in
fact if you look at the terror the
terror took a war on terror in the last
15 years it began in a small tribal area
in in Pakistan on the Afghan border it's
now all over the world what we call
terrorism is spread all over the world
the wonderful success you know we've
managed to magnify what we call
terrorism meaning what they do not what
we do all over the world West Africa
South Asia you know at least of course
everywhere and the inability to perceive
this is mind-boggling
