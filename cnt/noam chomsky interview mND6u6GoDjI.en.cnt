Dan's well I suspect there's going to be
a substantial change in that respect for
one thing as I'm sure you know the the
united nations came out with a study a
few years ago of slums there's the inner
city which i bleeding vibrant city and
the soon as you move behind the young
city it's not actually a wall but i like
fence there's miles and miles of the
most miserable unimaginable slums that
ever seen anywhere in the world getting
a larger and larger because people are
coming in from the countryside but they
can't survive they can't get into the
city because now the education talents
opportunities aren't there and so on so
they congregate in urban slums sometimes
they're inside the city you can go not
too far from here and see real off its
lumps another problem is that
the kind of in the advanced particularly
in countries like the United States
maybe the u.s. is the most extreme
example the suburbanization over the
last 50 years which was very self
conscious state corporate policy is
completely unviable I mean it just can't
survive it's an ecologically on viral
untenable that the use of energy is
untenable with it's simply can serve up
transportation energy use everyone has
to have two cars you know also just has
very little o sense of community people
are skated from one another firstly they
don't live near each other and even if
they do they don't know each other
because that's not the way these needs
work and that's a major issue not
everywhere but dramatic in the united
states where there was very conscious
social policy to expand the use of car's
fuel so on and so forth and it has led
to the breakdown of the cities and
scattering of the population and now a
reverse move of gentrification of the
cities which is driving out the border
population they are as rich people
coming these are all elements of urban
life that just can't be overlooked but
many of the same problems exist there
will have to be a very serious redesign
of urban life and the scattering
populations if the species is going to
survive we just can't go on this way the
capitalist one emphasizes a private gain
and concentration of wealth and
concentration of power so it leads
almost inevitably to a society of
mansions you know extremely elegant
apartments right along
misery and poverty and so on and also in
a way which is massively wasteful of
very scarce resources so that's not I
don't think that's a viable system at
all as being exploit other parts of the
world they're in for trouble what has to
be done is a reshaping of priorities and
goals so that we live in a sustainable
cooperative world with really
functioning communities which
participated in democratic processes
which is their own social planning which
and which take into account first of all
objective constraints like the
environmental constraints but also just
human conditions like living together
like you know me I think a very new
model it has to be developed including
just one point of architecture and you
can't go on building buildings homes and
cities and so on without concern for the
fact that you are imposing a huge burden
on future generations may be a burden
that can't be mad because of the
destructiveness of the techniques and
the lack of concern for consequences
like they just simply energies can be
done Lucilla collapsar Africa rain at

La Silla might sell the collapsar well
it's interesting to see what's been
happening well first of all collapses
happen over and over again in the whole
history of Europe is history of the
savage destruction the massacre Second
World War urban societies collapsed all
that work as they were destroyed him
that's real major collapse they've
recovered over time that the kind of
collapse you're talking about i think is
a different one that's something that's
not
the conscious destruction but the kind
of collapse that's inherent in human
institutions meaning that the
institutions are set to change so pick
say the financial crisis the financial
crisis centers will kind of short-term
reasons you know subprime mortgages and
so on but the basic source of it is just
inefficiency of markets I mean markets
are inefficient systems and every
economist learns they only provide
certain choices not others so the
concrete the ice might go home tonight
after work well the market offers me a
choice between going home in a Toyota or
afford it does not offer me the choice
of going home by public transportation
because that's not a market decision the
market just doesn't have that option
that's a collective decision which can
be made in a society now can they make
autocratically you know by the Kremlin
or it could be made democratically but
in any event it's a social position and
it's out of markets and their huge
number of things like this the market is
very narrow in the choices that it
provides you can sell me a farm and you
and I can make a bargain that's good for
both of us know you like the price I
like the price but we're not taking into
account the cost of our transaction to
her and there's a cost there's more
pollution gas prices go up there's more
congestion her life is harder and so on
so its cost and that cost is spread over
a great number of people and it's even
spread over future generations because
of the what we're doing to the
atmosphere but you and I don't take that
into account when we make a transaction
ok that's an inefficiency of market
built in inefficiency and not small

democracia to all Barcelona's the
obvious place to talk about reviving
anarchist ideas it's the place where
they were catalonia an hour gone so
under the place where they were most
fully realized in 1936 for a brief
period because sittin there was a
combined effort of Russia the fascist
countries and the liberal West that
joined together to crush this heresy the
heresy that you could actually have
freedom democracy cooperation and so on
that it's so dangerous that all the
great powers no matter what they're
politically we kind of countries they
were they cooperated on that that was
the main test destroy the Spanish
revolution after they destroyed Spanish
revolution they sort of fought with each
other to decide who's going to pick up
the pc but so yes and i think that those
are exactly the kinds of ideas at the
world mate it's a adapt them different
circumstances but basically the idea
that authoritarian structures i have no
inherent legitimacy they're not
self-justifying Struth it's in a family
patriarch or family its roof its
international society and you know super
power anywhere in between if there is a
structure of authority and domination it
is not self-justifying it had a burden
of proof that has to prove that it has a
justification I person will never be
given and it can't be given the
structures already this mantle and that
would lead to a free
voluntary a society based on free
voluntary Association cooperation mutual
aid and so on and unless the world moves
in that direction out of the human
species as much a future and this is
just the right place to talk about on
the second question that's worth it's
through the Obama immobilized a lot of
young people but what did he move allows
him to do he mobilized them to push door
bills to advance what is actually called
brand Obama okay that's not democratic
as fascist he mobilized a kind of a
fascist movement in which a lot of young
people are sitting there ready to take
orders next time orders come about what
Obama wants okay you go out and push the
door belts or brand Obama that's the
opposite of the democratic system and
there are democratic systems in fact
rather strikingly although this can't be
perceived in the West the poorest
country in the continental hemisphere
name of Bolivia continental cross haiti
squares but it's on the continent the
poorest countries Olivia that's also the
most democratic I mean they had a an
election fight four years ago in which
the large majority of the population
which is indigenous not happens to be
the most repressed population in the
hemisphere reach the sufficient level of
organization where they could enter the
political arena elect a candidate from
their own ranks not some rich guy went
to the great university but a poor
peasant and they developed the policies
that he's supposed to follow so under
serious issues and everybody knew them
it's not here where issues of stress
everyone knew them control over
resources issues of justice and cultural
rights big issues and multi-ethnic
societies complex ullin linguistic
rights
these were the issues they came out of
public debate discussion and activism
and the elected representatives are
supposed to represent them that's quite
different from issuing instructions to
an army of doorbell pushers who are
supposed to advocate brand Obama exact
opposite yeah much more close to
democracy like other cultural practices
architecture has the power to dissent to
project an alternative view of the world
from the mainstream view but how do you
balance popular demand against the
opportunity for the architect or more
generally the individual to put forward
that alternative view yeah it's very
real question all right if you ever
built people like meet you or a tacit ex
but had houses face it all the time you
know the architect wants to do something
that's aesthetically pleasing looks nice
and so on behinds the unliving
