I first they started in 65 r IC 6 that's
after years of what and in fact the
large-scale protest would finally took
place was after about five years of war
by then South Vietnam been destroyed the
war had expanded the rest of Indochina
and yeah they were effective but very
late and in the elite sectors you know
the articulate sectors like the media
commentary there was really never any
perche never any purpose protest on
tactical grounds it was very striking
what happened by the city the end of the
war in 1975 formal into the war the
population about seventy percent of the
population regarded the war as
fundamentally wrong and immoral not a
mistake as the polls from roughly then
if you look at the liberal commentary in
the press say at the extreme end may be
anthony lewis in the new york times his
some he summed up the war by 75 by
saying the United States entered Vietnam
with blundering efforts to do good well
efforts to do good is a tautology our
state did it it's to do good blundering
didn't quite work so we entered with
blundering efforts to do good but by
1969 it was clear that the war was a
disaster too costly to ourselves now
that's what you could read in Providence
were in Afghanistan but that was
considered sharp critique of the war
meanwhile the public was way off to the
anti-war so well let's fast forward to
now in those years we had conscription
we had the classrooms that you and I
taught in full of young men who were
having to make critical decisions about
what they were going to do whether to go
live in Sweden Canada not registered for
the draft resist or go in the military
55,000 United States military died some
400,000 were injured countless hundreds
of thousands of more came back with
psychological
abilities which they suffer to this day
here we are at this time in kind of a
perpetual militarized situation in this
country strike the kind of in a
perpetual militarized situation in this
country where the Obama administration
is now facing a decision suppose it
would be about Afghanistan but the
protest against that such as it is is an
intellectualized one largely on the
internet to some extent in what's left
to the left media we don't have
conscription it does not reach down into
every classroom and every family and
every neighborhood the militarization of
this country where does reach down into
is the economy but nobody talks about
that well you're right but I but we have
to ask why don't we have a draft now
well we know the draft because the Army
in the Pentagon and the government
realized that in Vietnam they had made a
tactical mistake you cannot use a
civilian army to carry out a brutal
colonial war our predecessors didn't use
colonial armies peasant mert citizens
armies so the French used the Foreign
Legion you know the British used the
Gurkhas or in an arable the
Revolutionary War the Hessians know
there was a sprinkling the officer corps
might be civilian but basically
mercenary armies by the late sixties the
you know the top leadership realize they
had made a mistake I don't really think
it's because of the effect of the draft
at home I think that's vastly
exaggerated in fact the you know when
you were involved I was involved the the
kind of leading edge of the anti-war
movement let's say the resistance it was
mostly led by kids would never get
drafted like theology students or
students the elite universities they
don't want to get drafted they didn't
have to they put themselves on the line
they faced serious dangers many years in
jail
the egg permanent exile it's not an easy
decision for a 18 year old kid they did
it it was very courageous it spread it
had a big effect but that can't be
recognized in the mainstream doctrine
it's dangerous to recognize that people
can take honorable courageous actions on
principal grounds you're supposed to go
as far as say Anthony Lewis a tactical
error cost us too much let's let's pull
out actually that's like Obama he's
considered a in the doctrinal system a
principled opponent of the Iraq war what
was his opposition they said it's a
strategic blunder again that's the same
kind of thing you could have read in
Pravda in 1985 and did read people who
said the invasion of Afghanistan was a
strategic blunder we don't call that
principled opposition I mean you could
have found that in the german general
staff after Stalingrad two-front war is
a strategic blunder what's significant
is principled opposition and that did
exist in the 60s it still exists in fact
in the case of Afghanistan the protest
is greater than it was in Vietnam at any
comparable stage of the war you go back
to when there were sixty thousand troops
in Vietnam under conscripts protest was
almost zero wouldn't even talked about
what do you mean protest I don't see any
protests these days very much at all and
lets you count my emails yeah there's a
there's a national day of protest coming
up yes there is October so getting all
right that's massive protest that's the
first one in about two years I mean what
I'm saying is that it but indicate in
the 60s there was nothing for well
that's a big difference what do you make
of the fact that the debate in
officialdom over Afghanistan now seems
to be either let's turn it into another
Vietnam let's keep pouring troops in
for one strategic goal or another or
let's pull back to the Joe Biden
solution which is basically airborne
death squads sending the Predators will
find out where they are maybe we'll know
maybe we won't there'll be a lot of
collateral damage but at least our boys
and girls won't be in danger and those
seem to be the permissible contours in
Washington of the debate massive
military intervention with consequent
great loss of life or surgical as they
say military intervention with less loss
of life on the side of the intervenors
but probably equal or greater loss of
life on the part of the subject
population again let's that's correct
but I'm not suggesting that there has
been a shift in elite attitudes there's
been a shift in popular attitudes so and
when they talk about massive
intervention it doesn't even begin to
compare with Vietnam I'm they're talking
about maybe a hundred thousand people by
1965 when protests started they were
talking about hundreds of thousands at
plus you know 50 70 thousand mercenaries
and so on so yes those are the
parameters of debate and it's our fault
that those are the parameters for
example we ought to be pointing out that
there's a fundamental problem in the
debate in Washington the relevant voices
aren't even being heard I mean these
decisions should be made by Afghans we
have any right to make a decision is
between the Biden and McChrystal good
sir and this interesting ugly Sunday's
New York Times had a full page of what
should we do about Afghanistan ten
different opinions not a single one of
which was by an Afghani person yeah and
they you know they have voices and for
example is an Afghan peace movement
pretty significant one you can find out
about it but you're not going to read
about it here they have spokespersons
quite elegant ones some of them pretty
impressive the most impressive that I
know is a
a woman named Malalai Joya who's a
remarkable woman she's survived somehow
miraculously struggling against the
Russians against the Reagan's favor at
the murderers warlords who took over and
we're so Atlanta out rages that the
population welcomed the Taliban she
struggled against them struggling
against the return of the Warlord's
which is essentially the current
government got elected parliament with a
lot of support I was quickly thrown out
because she denounced the warlords who
dominate the government living
underground protected but she speaks
written a book and it's interesting she
gives talks and her proposal which is
that of the Afghan peace movement and
maybe that of for all we know the large
majority of Afghans know nobody looks
it's kind of supported more or less by
the poles that are taken but her
position is Afghanistan needs an
invasion an invasion of schools
hospitals roads not an invasion of guns
and tanks half gans will if given a
chance will work at the problems we
don't want we're subject to an assault
from the Taliban from the Warlord's and
from the occupying army and we want to
get out of that attack and we've have to
work it out ourselves so help us but not
this way but that voice is not part of
the debate to take some of our questions
from the audience here at the
commonwealth club tonight question asks
can movements like the green alternative
energy movement make a true difference
in the world if population continues to
grow and how can we globally ever come
to an agreement to stop population
growth if that's deemed necessary
there's a lot understood I mentioned
before not too much is known about human
affairs but something is understood
about population growth there are
basically two ways to retard it one way
is the Chinese way by force you know
and it's causing them plenty of problems
quite apart from the brutality of it the
other way to solve it is educate women
there's very good evidence that as
education of women increases a
population declines fertility declines
and levels and sometimes even literally
declines there's some remarkable
examples so take say India they're one
of the poorer provinces in india kerala
in the south it happens who have a very
enlightened government since
independence we're not allowed to say it
here but it was a communist led
government so forget that girl out here
it's not well topic there was pretty
enlighten government in fact when
Congress came in they had to follow
pretty much the same policies literacy
is extremely high there's education of
women and fertility has leveled and
declined unlike the rest of india and
it's happening in Europe what's
happening in Japan it's happening
everywhere if women have options and
choices I wish they don't have in most
of the world then yes population levels
in fact in Europe and Japan is even
declining the so there are two methods
to deal with the populate with excessive
population growth and I think it's
pretty obvious which one we should
pursuing so I don't see that as the
major problem the ecological
environmental problems are enormous
grotesque in fact if the species
succeeds in destroying itself as it may
it will be either from nuclear weapons
or from destruction of the environment
and in both cases in the case of the
environmental threats again there are
two tendencies in opposite directions so
compare it again with the 60s virtually
no concern there was environmental
movement almost nothing now it is a very
substantial movement it's a substantial
popular movement pressing pretty hard on
green alternatives cutting down energy
waste and so on but this counter
tendency as there always is the business
world so just recently within the last
few weeks the American Petroleum
Institute and the Chamber of Commerce
the biggest business lobby and others
Anna announced you can read in the press
that they're inspired by the example of
the health insurers who months ago knew
that they had one but front page cover
business week in August health insurers
of one we got it they had a terrific
technique which essentially killed the
possibility of desperately needed health
reform they know it's going to tank the
economy but that's somewhere in the
future the personal consequences they
don't care about the you know they have
again not not that the bad people desert
instance way the institutions work well
the Petroleum Institute Chamber of
Commerce say we're going to follow that
model and try to make sure that no
serious energy environmental bills are
passed by Congress now there was an
interesting split in the chamber of
commerce some energy corporations pulled
out and say we're not going to cooperate
with this you look at who they were
they're the ones who produce nuclear
energy so they'd like to have you no tax
on fossil fuel use then they can make
more money they'll kill us some other
way you know but and again let me it's
important to stress that this these are
not bad people they're probably good
people just like anyone else but they
are working within an institutional
framework which requires certain choices
if you don't make those choices you're
out so the institutions require
infecting the law requires it you have
to be committed to maximizing profit and
growth in the short term that's
amplified by perverse incentives like
the too big to fail
I'm an insurance policy which is now
even bigger than it was before thanks to
the bank bailout and the way the money
was distributed and other perversions
like you know incentives like tying CEO
pay to short-term gain and other
structures like that well let me let me
ask you about another incentive that
doesn't come in that way the peak oil
incentive you're certainly familiar with
that theory if it happens and you can
tell if you believe it's happening or is
going to happen do you believe that it
fatally in dangers democracy and would
move us inevitably towards nationalist
or fascist policies this is a question
from the audience well you know my own
feeling I'm a peak oil will come sooner
or later of course finite resource but
it's a complex notion I mean the real
question is not how much oil is
underground but how much can be
extracted at a comically feasible price
now it's pushing the limits now oil
extraction is more and more costly and
more and more environmentally dangerous
because you're going after sources that
are harder to use at some point it will
become impossible to continue but nobody
knows how far that point is however from
another point of view it's we're
probably better off if peak oil comes
sooner because that will reduce the use
of fossil fuels and help preserve
environment for our grandchildren to
live in so and business knows this I
mean takes a The Wall Street Journal
they've been the leading deniers of
global warming you read the editorial
pages it's it makes Rush Limbaugh look
like a moderate but a couple of a couple
of weeks ago they ran a supplement on
the environment which took a very strong
stand on the need for radical
measures to try to sustain the
environment if I could even call for
geoengineering they said that the
measures being considered in Washington
aren't enough well you know it's a
reason for that I mean these are after
all the people who own the world they
don't want their possession destroyed so
they have mixed motives too but it's the
populations gonna have to drive this and
in that respect there has been a pretty
substantial progress in the last 30 40
years speaking of something the
population is going to have to drive I'm
going to change topics with another
question from the audience here right
after our remind our radio listeners
you're listening to the Commonwealth
Club of California radio program I marry
Ben ski our guest is noam chomsky
linguist political activist and author
most recently of the essential Chomsky
edited by Anthony aren't off this
question from the audience Noam Chomsky
is do you think that taking money out of
politics fair election clean money
campaigns is first of all possible in
this country and second of all would it
be effective in solving many of our
political problems in the United States
I think it wouldn't be easy because
there are a lot of ways to get around
any regulations but it would be possible
however and it would certainly have a
good effect I mean the campaign funding
is a remarkably good predictor of
election and also of policy in pretty
well predict policies by looking at
where the campaign funding comes from
there's good political science work on
this Thomas Ferguson very fine political
economist has done extremely good work
on this and it's convincing and in fact
we see it right in front of us all the
time so the rate of election of
incumbents is overwhelming it's like 98
99 percent this is happening at the same
time that public attitudes towards
approval of Congress is in the low teens
but they are out spending their
opponents s'okay they get elected
people don't like them or just take the
last election 2008 I'm of the core of
Obama's funded was financial
institutions they preferred him to
McCain they thought he'd served them
better and it's turning out it's
probably true you can almost read off
the policies of the administration from
looking at the concentrated campaign
funding financial institutions are doing
marvelously so yes taking money out of
politics would be a good idea very good
it's not going to solve all our problems
that much deeper than that but it would
be substantial would be hard because
they're all kind of ways to get around
it but it's an important topic and here
tendencies are going in the wrong
direction right now the Supreme Court is
considering a suit which what it amounts
to is eat a lot if they if they approve
if they change the law which it probably
will it means the corporation's can buy
elections directly instead of indirectly
so that they don't put it that way but
you think through it that's what it
amounts to so that's what the Supreme
Court is doing and there's something
kind of surreal going on because at the
very same time at the logic of this for
the Supreme Court is that corporations
are persons they have personal rights so
therefore have the right of free speech
that was in fact a gift to the corporate
world by the courts about a century ago
conservatives who used to exist the name
does not the category bitterly condemned
they called it a form of communism a
return to feudalism and so on but they
got it and by now they have rights way
beyond persons so because they have
rights of persons they have the right of
free speech so therefore they can buy
elections directly at the same time
Congress is there's a competition going
on in Congress between the Democrats and
the Republicans to see who can be more
brutal in denying health care to
undocumented
and there's a legal argument behind that
too they're not persons under the law
the courts have shaped American law so
that if you're an undocumented and
you're not a person you don't have
personal rights so on the one hand the
corporate entities are have rights of
persons and have to be allowed to buy
elections directly on the other hand
undocumented it ends on whose backs a
lot of the economy rides they're not
persons and therefore we the Democrats
and Republicans have to show that we're
more savage than the opposition in
denying them health care we shouldn't be
allowing this to happen before our eyes
I mean the facts are there but they're
not being discussed there's no they're
not being addressed and that's another
serious lack of people who care about
living in a civilized community well
we've reached the point in our program
where we have time for only one last
question from our audience will kind of
come back to where we were at the
beginning of this discussion with noam
chomsky what answer would you give to
the frustrated hard-working people as
you describe them attracted by the
narrative of the right that you listened
to brave you on am talk radio well take
the fact that their incomes have
stagnated for 30 years their benefits
decline workers are going up and so on
well suppose they say that's because the
government's giving all the time so we
should be giving the right answer
immigrants the right answer is that has
to do with the reconstruction of the
economy that took place in the 1970s
which shifted us from a high growth
relatively egalitarian economy the 50s
and 60s to a financial up to what's
called a neoliberal economy with a vast
growth of financial institutions
evisceration of productive capacity
shifting it abroad where it's more
profitable and yeah this has lots of
predictable effects one of them is the
financial crisis crises that
happened periodically the growth of the
financial institutions is phenomenal and
that doesn't help people it's say a 1970
was maybe three percent of gross
domestic product and now it's well over
thirty percent well you know that it's
great for Goldman Sachs and so on it's
not great for these people who are
concerned that their lives are falling
apart which tell them that we should
tell them that the heroes that there is
a massive business run corporate program
its scale is astonishing it's been
pretty well studied goes back to the
1950s it was designed as I said before
to make people hate and fear government
but in a there's a little secret behind
it the people are running the campaign
will love government and they want it to
be powerful and interventionist but in
their interest but what people are told
is supposed to hate government so take
for example April fifteenth okay when
April fifteenth comes along in the
comparable date and a functioning
democracy people would be applauding I
say okay this is the day in which we get
together and provide the resources for
the programs that we have decided on
what could be better than that in the
United States thanks to massive
propaganda you're supposed to hate April
fifteenth because that's the day when
some alien force you know like from Mars
is coming down here and stealing your
hard-earned money well that's a real
triumph in undermining and destroying
the fundamental basis of democracy and
for elite opinion for business yeah that
makes sense then like democracy elites
never do well that's our failure to have
permitted this to happen well let me
also put in a word for media literacy
here because along with the developments
you're talking about came deregulation
of ownership absol radio and television
stations and abolition of the Fairness
Doctrine so that radio and television
along
added to provide any balance in their
discussion of public issues and the rise
of the talk radio fanatics that have
distorted public debate in this country
and television of course an entire
network you're right you're right i
think it's very important but I again I
think we should be asking questions
about ourselves why don't we exploit
this situation make use of it reach
these people with you know a sensible
message that can lead them us to better
lives and a more democratic society well
got to do that this tremendous amount of
activism in the country I suspect that
if you can't know to count noses more
than in the 60s but it's a very atomized
isolated society people in one corner of
town don't know what's happening in the
other corner of town there are separate
agendas the sectarianism you know we got
of our way you can of your way the
success in atomizing the society has
been enormous there's the internet
played into that the internet I think
has a complicated effect and it does
separate people because you're not weird
one thing about human beings is
face-to-face communication means
something communicating through you know
a text message doesn't have that meaning
so it does separate people in fact it
contributes to the ideal of the business
world which is a society in which the
elementary the atoms are a dyad you and
the tube but no communication other than
that that's tremendous technique of
control so it has that effect on the
other hand it's the you know it is the
tool for all the organizing and
activists acted efforts that go on and
also for education so it's you know the
internet really is like a lot of
Technology it's fundamentally neutral
depends who is using it and for what
purpose and how class stratified do you
think it will continue to be do you see
any tendencies
towards greater participation people
having more access to that technology
yeah there's more access but more access
alone doesn't help you if the access
that you have leads to you know more to
a huge range of choices where you have
no framework or structure to decide what
makes sense then it's negative if
there's more access that's guided and
directed by the kind of understanding
and comprehension that can really only
come out of cooperative efforts and
education which is a cooperative effort
if it's serious yeah that kind of access
makes sense that's very much like the
sciences I suppose you're say of
biologists say the women have just won
the Nobel Prize she didn't become a
great biologist by reading everything in
the biology journals or to cut randomly
picking out things that appeared in the
biology journals and that's it they'll
destroy it as she became a good
biologist by having an understanding of
what to look for having a framework of
comprehension and insight that comes out
of cooperative activities science is a
cooperative activity you know this
occasional people work in their own but
mostly it's highly interactive and it
lead at best not always it does lead to
understanding interchange communication
improvement of your thinking directing
it better and you out of that comes a
way to kind of wade through the huge
mass of information there and find out
what's significant but if will you are
trained to care about is your belief
system uninstructed by anything other
than tradition you're in a different
framework that's very bad and if what
you're trained for from childhood is to
pass the next test it's worse destroys
your thinking there's a name for that
it's called No Child Left Behind NZ
truth which really means never a child
left behind and if that's every one of
us is you know we've mostly go into good
schools and so on I'm sure you have the
same experience I've had you you had to
pass an exam maybe the SATs or whatever
it is so you study like a maniac you
pass the exam you forget everything the
next day because that's not the way to
learn anything I was talking to a
teacher the other day actually while I
was here who like most teachers very
much post all of this she was describing
she has daughter in the schools I forget
what great but she was telling me that
her daughter is in a class where they
were studying the Constitution and the
teacher said meant told the class or
maybe the book told them that Georgia
didn't participate in the Constitutional
Convention and her daughter came home
and told her she said you know I was
curious I want to know why so I asked
the teacher why didn't George a joint
and the teachers answer was will be
enough time for that we've got to get to
the next point so you'll be able past it
speaking of not having time yeah our
thanks very much to dr. Noam Chomsky
noam chomsky author most recently of the
essential Chomsky we also want to thank
our audiences here in san francisco and
on the radio for the commonwealth club
i'm larry been ski now this meeting of
the Commonwealth Club of California
celebrating more than a century of
enlightened discussion is adjourned
