that's all over the place education
television every jewelry huge fortunes
trying to drive you there and it works
will our consent it's a very introverted
atomized societies by mounds of the kind
of word invasions that held me together
k them opportunities to work in
solidarity others for the common good to
be written under severe that immunity
take the United States crackle watch you
by the same was true of organization
that had Flint organizations little
parties which has the positions that
people can participate in corner and we
have system
we have a system in which you can push a
button to select a candidate who has
been vetted by private capital we make
fun of the Iranian elections because of
the candidates have to pass through the
Guardian Council clarity but anytime
States and fullerton janitor the
candidates have to pass the or being
executive bright concentrated right
academy overwhelming you just kind of
immediately begin to get into the system
that they should have passed capital
resources and in the system that's how
you get the position share house
congress and so on so forth and then the
population is allowed to paint once in a
while to be clean in within this narrow
range of choices so but the kinds of
participation and organization which
could overcome the apathy the apathy
that's arise from hopelessness they've
been eroded
its population environment well the main
way to do with that problem is just
simply you really have been placed under
public control there's no reason in a
tie or morality or anything else that
says that you should be private pyrenees
when they are caring and about as close
to develop arianna jay institution that
humans have contrived disable it orders
and so on at the bottom you can rent
yourself too so there's a reason typed
by law they are bound conserve the
interests of owners careful I'm
principle that says that they should
they could just as well the cars the
principles that you can't even read this
in the business literature and I can
just well be required to take any county
serve the interests
stakeholders of the workforce the
community and in fact that should be
running that's a traditional view of the
workers movements in the left those who
work in the well milf alone back in the
19th century right up until today so the
best answer the question is it written
tournament to democratic institutions
which are popularly controlled and which
the public can make use of to serve
common interest well okay that's a long
step but not one that you feel devote a
shorter step is just to make life hard
for them and make life hard what to do
what they do just as the way you we've
been to do it with any other patella
Terry institution if you're living in a
totalitarian state you made use of what
opportunities there are to respect the
power of the authorities and you can do
that with these journeys to things like
the shareholder protests and boycotts
that administration's efforts that
change legislation to the bar they're
more destructive practices storm there's
a range of possibilities available then
there and there's the whole world
what you take Sadie the environmental
movement say the movement which in
Canada substantially led by First
Nations with other participant all over
the place so in in the countries that
had bargained digits populations like
Ecuador Bolivia and there are
significant steps being taken to
preserve what's called rights of nature
that's expanding the concept of rights
from free property men on through women
on way non-property the annals of
Tunisia which also has rights than T
that our defender also can all the
improved so presumably be country in
Ecuador which a large indigenous
population the government did attempt to
get aid from the rich countries mostly
European Union to allow them to keep
their oil resources underground where
they are well the richest countries
the aid of their now exploiting
destroying the entire but at least there
are pressures the human rights and civil
rights movements are other significant
cases visa proliferation of cooperatives
and worker owned enterprises and
protectionism the student protests over
ranging from Jordan the president and
tuition increases just the technique of
control indoctrination on to draw the
rights of those are positive elements
very striking development when I
mentioned earlier is the liberation of
South America from Western control is 10
years as a change of really discouraged
and Indians 500 years of coordination to
Western Power and to live mostly white
tiny leaks within has been significantly
arose that's a positive development
there things like this Hanuman haven't
got to the point where they're radically
changing the world
