the Clinton administration particularly
poured arms into Turkey to try to
support their counterinsurgency
operations which we're not just against
the PKK they carried out major
atrocities all throughout southeastern
Turkey in the Kurdish areas they
destroyed according to the Turkish
government about 3,500 towns and
villages wiped them out drove out you
know probably millions of people I've
been there and I've seen it and I've
also seen the slums in Istanbul where
the remnants try to survive they it the
number of people killed nobody knows
because we don't count our own
atrocities but according to Kurdish
sources it's on the order of 50,000
that's from the mayor of the Arabic your
usual numbers given a 30,000 so you know
massive atrocities as if you want to
read there's a lot of evidence about
this they're deep they haven't have a
very good human rights specialist
Jonathan Sugden
they're analysts in southeastern Turkey
he has now been kicked out by the
Turkish government was trying to
investigate what's happening but he has
did compile very serious detailed
reports right through the 90s every
imaginable kind of torture barbarism
destruction ecological devastation huge
ethnic cleansing you know one of the
major atrocities of the 1990s
and so did Amnesty International so of
independent reporters and others as an
effect in Turkey there are plenty of
people know about this I've taken part
in Istanbul in protests by leading
Turkish writers academics artists
journalists and others who are
courageously protesting against these
atrocities which is not easy in Turkey
you know it's not Turkish jails are not
much fun but they not only protest
against them but they're constantly
carrying out civil disobedience against
them I was able to participate once and
it's because they know perfectly well
what's happening furthermore they want
it publicized so when I was visiting
Turkey
actually to take part in a trial of a
publisher who was being sent to jail
because he published a few remarks of
mine about it I was just invited all
over the place by Turkish television
because they wanted it said and they
can't say it so it was all over the
papers and television and so on I was in
fact often given a award by the Turkish
Publishers Association not because I did
anything particularly remarkable but
just because I was saying what they knew
and can't say the as the atrocities
escalated through the 90s aid from the
Clinton administration increased by 19
in the year single year 1997 one year
Clinton provided more arms to the
Turkish military than the entire Cold
War period combined up to the onset of
the counter insurgency well took a lot
of discipline here in the United States
for the press to shut up about this I
mean here they're talking about you know
terrible atrocities going on in the
Balkans by these bad Serbs and others
meanwhile write on the board how can we
stand it if right on the borders of NATO
some terrible thing is happening try to
find an article which said right within
the borders of NATO even worse things
are happening and you're paying for it
not just the United States Germany
involved Britain than others but
primarily the Clinton administration
