good evening everyone my name is John
Paul Jones and I'm the Dean of the
College of Social and Behavioral
Sciences thank you on behalf of the
college's faculty staff and students I
want to welcome all of you here tonight
for a first annual SPS annual lecture
and without a doubt this is going to be
a very hard act to follow before we get
started I have a few people to thank
the first is al Bergesen head of the
Department of Sociology who recommended
this series as a way to showcase the
best of the social behavioral sciences
to our local community
the second I'd like to thank two faculty
who have been long associated with
professor Chomsky and who helped make
his appearance here tonight possible
Massimo Pia tele amorini and Thomas ever
both teach in our world-class Department
of linguistics and in fact there's so
many faculty with research ties to
Chomsky in the department of linguistics
that this department is sometimes
referred to as MIT West I'd also like to
thank the head of the department of
linguistics
sameen Karimi as well as the many
faculty staff and students from the
department who have been working so hard
on this event on the screen behind me is
a list of some of the donors who have
helped sponsor tonight's lecture I would
especially like to thank our co-sponsor
confluence Center for creative inquiry
and its director Xavier Durand
financial support has also come from
members of the SPS Magellan circle and
tonight tonight's event is especially
underwritten by Magellan Circle member
Elyse Colin shields and her husband
Creston shields thank you very much
I'd also like to thank the support of
the Arizona Daily Star the College of
Education and its Dean Ron marks and the
College of Humanities and its Dean Mary
Willner Bassett other thank you
others contributing to this event
include the school of Anthropology that
cognitive science program the Department
of Communication the department of
computer science the school of geography
and development the department of gender

and thanks to everyone in the dean's
office and an SPS development and in the
Centennial group Centennial Hall group
have put all this together thank you all
very much
well now what can I say about tonight's
speaker who after all has been as
intellectually influential as Noam
Chomsky the author of 100 books and
countless articles he is the founder of
modern linguistics his ideas have not
only revolutionized linguistics they
have indelibly shaped anthropology
cognitive science childhood education
computer science the languages
mathematics psychology philosophy and
speech in fact you can find
self-described Chomsky i'ts in every
field that asks the question what does
it mean to be human if there was a Nobel
Prize for social and behavioral sciences
he would have won it long ago with his
original book the first book syntactic
structures which appeared in 1957 he is
according to the Chicago Tribune the
most cited living author and he's third
most cited in the world behind Plato and
Freud
professor chomp-chomp ski gave a
research talk yesterday to a small group
1200 faculty students and community
members in the UA Student Union and I
have to say I was overwhelmed by the
response Tucson by all rights you have a
claim on the title the Athens of the
West and of course there is Chomsky to
public intellectual the self-described
libertarian socialist and anarchist a
critic of established politicians on
both the left and the right
an activist who has influenced millions
professor Chomsky is well known for his
relentless critiques of u.s. foreign
policy from his outspoken stance against
the Vietnam War
in his first political book American
power and the new mandarins to his
forthcoming 2012 volume a collection of
essays titled making the future
occupations interventions empire and
resistance the topic of tonight's
lecture education for whom and for what
draws on another line of critique one
based on a lifetime of thinking about
education role in the pursuit of
democracy justice and freedom for us at
the University of Arizona these issues
are of utmost importance as we grapple
with how to maintain quality and access
and the face of over 180 million dollars
of budget cuts in recent years today
only 16% of the total university budget
comes from the state a figure that was
is half of what it was ten years ago of
course
these cuts have occurred not just in
Arizona but in all states and they go
directly to the question of whether
higher education should be a public good
a common investment in our children's
and our state's futures or instead
solely a private matter left to would-be
students and their families professor
Chomsky's remarks tonight will
undoubtedly spark reflection on this and
many other questions related to
education and now I'd like to say a few
words about tonight's proceedings
following professor Chomsky's talk we
have allotted approximately thirty
minutes for a question and answer period
moderated by Arizona Public Media's
Christopher Conover I was up here a
minute ago mr. Conover has over 23 years
of experience in broadcast journalism
and has been a mainstay at kuat and Koz
since 2005 and I'm very grateful to him
for his help tonight
finally throughout the evening I ask
that whatever your opinions you respect
those of our guests and your neighbors
in the audience for tonight we have a
unique opportunity to engage in
thoughtful civil discourse with one of
the greatest intellectuals and public
figures or figures of our time please
join me in giving a warm warm Tucson
welcome to Professor Noam Chomsky
thank you very much
I hear what you said
sorry couldn't hear it but I'm sure it
was very important so I hope everyone
else did
well I'm going to concentrate mostly on
higher education but that can't really
be disconnected from what happens from
infancy so I'll say some words about
early education too in the background
there are contrasting conceptions of
whom education is for and what it is for
so let's take a look at whom it is for
what there to view two fundamental views
go far back one of them one view is that
education is higher education is for
basically for the elites for the
privileged the rest of the population
should be dumbed down may be allowed
entry into vocational schools of learned
trades there's a more general conception
that lies in the background and which
strikingly holds across the mainstream
political spectrum that's more
instructive almost always to focus on
the left liberal extreme so I'll keep to
that the less harsh extreme so for
example the the leading public
intellectuals of the 20th century walter
Lippmann who was
kind of a Wilson Roosevelt Kennedy
liberal he his view was that the general
that we have to distinguish between the
intelligent minority called the
responsible men and what he called the
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders that's
the general population who have to be
spectators but not participants in
action and the responsible men only
anyone who ever discusses this is always
part of the intelligent minority by
definition so the intelligent minority
the responsible men who are in charge of
decision-making they have to be
protected in his words from the a roar
and the trampling of the bewildered herd
he developed the concept of manufacture
of consent I said a new art of democracy
which has to be used to keep the
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders from
interfering he was actually relying on
his own experience this was these
writings in the 1920s and so these are
called progressive essays on democracy
he was relying on his experience in the
first and in many ways only official US
propaganda agency the Committee on
Public Information
term that were well the would have liked
that was the creel Commission
established during the First World War
to try to drive a pacifist population
into raving war mongers and it worked
pretty successfully it was led by the
responsible men the intelligent minority
who were more or less unaware that they
themselves were the targets of an
earlier propaganda agency the British
Ministry of Information
another Orwellian phrase which was
essentially designed to control the
thought of American elites so they would
therefore participate in the great task
of bringing America into the first world
war on England side the another member
of the creel Commission that was also
very impressed by it was Edward Bernays
now he's the one of the main founders of
the modern public relations industry and
his views were about the same there has
to be an intelligent minority in control
and we have to have a technique he
called it engineering of consent to make
sure that the rabble stays in their
place as spectators not participants
that's
the basic view that was back much
farther so for example long before this
Ralph Waldo Emerson that was considering
the question of why political leaders
are interested in having public
education mass public education was just
beginning and he said that the ground on
which eminent public servants urged the
claims of popular education is fear that
in their words he says this country is
filling up with thousands and millions
of voters and you must educate them to
keep them from our throats
meaning educate them the right way
keep their perspectives and their
understanding a narrow and restricted
discourage free and independent thought
and frighten them into obedience
something that's done over and over in
the schools as well we've all
experienced it if you have acted still
farther to the framing of the
Constitution it was based essentially on
the same principles so that James
Madison the major framer
his view was that pretty much the same
he said we have to make sure that the
public is marginalized because otherwise
they'll be trouble and in fact he read
the speeches in the Constitutional
Convention he urged the convention to
think about what would happen in England
that was obviously the model now what
would happen in England if they really
had a democratic vote he said well it
would happen would be that the majority
of the population would use their voting
power to take away the property of the
rich to carry out what these days we
would call land reform and obviously
that would be unjust so therefore we've
got to guard against democracy actually
it's kind of interesting that whether
consciously or not Madison was
reformulating an argument that goes back
to the first main major study of
political theory Aristotle's politics
Aristotle reviewed the many forms of
government there could be didn't like
any of them but decided that democracy
would be the least bad he's of course
mostly thinking of Athens and but he
raised the same dilemma he said this
same problem of madison did he said one
of the big problems of democracy is that
the majority of the poor would use their
voting power to take away and divide up
the property of the rich which is unjust
so Madison and aerosol will face the
same problem but they picked opposite
they drew opposite conclusions
Aristotle's conclusion was we should
eliminate inequality make everyone
middle class more or less and he
proposed actual measures
and what we would call today welfare
state measures and that would overcome
the problem so reduce inequality to
overcome the problem the madison
solution was the opposite reduced
democracy so design a system in which
the public will not be able to exercise
the kind of free vote that would
threaten the main one of the main goals
of government which he said is to
protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority so therefore so
same problem that opposite conclusions
reduced democracy and if you look at the
framing of the constitution that's the
way it's designed so again in Madison's
words the constitutional framework has
to ensure that power is in the hands of
what he called the wealth of the nation
the responsible men the men who have
respect for property and its rights and
therefore will ensure that the opulent
minority is protected from the majority
and that's why in the original framing
of the Constitution power is primarily
in the hands of the Senate the Senate
the executive and that time was kind of
an administrator so powers in the hands
of the Senate which remember people
didn't vote for that was much later
and the Senate he said would include
would be the wealth of the nation the
people who would make judicious and
responsible decisions actually in
Madison's defense it should be mentioned
that he was at this point pre-capitalist
so his model of the wealth of the nation
was some you know Mythology about Rome
you know we're distinguished gentlemen
and benign aristocrats devoted to the
public good would make all the right
decisions
he soon learned differently but that was
the model that's the way that's the
original intent of our constitution for
those who are interested in original
intent originalism to go back a little
bit further and go back to say David
Hume the first great modern political
philosophers he wrote a book called the
first principles of government and in
this he quote him he wondered that the
easiness with which the many are
governed by the few and the implicit
submission with which men resigned their
own sentiments and passions to those of
their rulers when we inquire by what
means this wonder is brought about we
shall find that as force is always on
the side of the governed the governors
have nothing to support them for
but opinion that is therefore on opinion
only that government is founded and this
maximum extends to the most despotic and
most military governments as well as to
the most free and most popular and in
fact in the more free and the more
popular where forces less available you
get the most sophisticated development
of the notions of manufacture of consent
engineering of consent to public
relations industry and so on and the
educational system has to be enlisted in
this enterprise it's very conscious
policy I'll return to the way it works
in the modern period well that's one
point of view about whom education is
for another alternative point of view
including high culture is that it's for
every way and there's interesting work
on this one book guidance strongly
recommend this if you have good eyesight
a very tiny print unfortunately is a
book by a scholarly book by Jonathan
rose it's called the intellectual life
of the British working classes it's a
monumental study of the reading habits
of nineteenth-century British workers
and it's pretty remarkable to see what
they were reading rose contrasts I'll
quote him contrasts the passionate
pursuit of knowledge by proletarian
autodidact with the pervasive Philistine
ism of the British aristocracy and he
has good
evidence worth and pretty much the same
was true in the United States so in
Boston let's say in the 19th century if
a blacksmith had enough it could afford
it that he would typically hire a young
boy to read to it while he's working and
reading meant reading classics or
contemporary literature that we know
considered classics in the fact in the
factories that were the mills that were
just beginning to be built in the early
days of the Industrial Revolution a lot
of the workers were young women from the
farms they called factory girls that
there was pretty lively labor press at
the time and very interesting to read
the factory girls had plenty of condom
nations of the industrial system into
which they were being forced come back
to a little bit but one of them was that
it was taking away their high culture
they were used to reading contemporary
literature and classics so on when they
were driven into the mills that was
taken away for them from and this
discontinued I mean I'm old enough to
remember the 1930s at that
there was lively programs of workers
education some of the leading scientists
and mathematicians wrote popular books
intended for worker education
mathematics for the millions things like
that
the George Gamow later went to three
infinity JD Bernal another well-known
scientist and there were educational
courses I mean my own family my
relatives were mostly unemployed working
class but they engaged they were deeply
immersed in high culture even those who
never made it through elementary school
now they were what Rose calls
proletarian autodidact although they
were helped by workers education courses
and things like free Shakespearean plays
in Central Park and so on well those are
two views of whom education is for two
contrasting ones then comes the question
what it is for and here too there are
contrasting views the contrast is
actually discussed during the
Enlightenment and there's an imagery
associated with it that one image is
that education is like pouring water
into an empty vessel and in fact it's a
pretty leaky vessel as you all know from
your experience
so you pour water into a vessel and of
course all of us have been through this
and you remember nothing
the other possibility the other
alternative is that education teaching
should be like laying how to string
along which the student can explore and
progress in his own way that image comes
from the home from Humboldt who was the
founder of the modern university system
also one of the founders of classical
liberalism you get to John Dewey
America's greatest social philosopher
isometric later he wrote that it is
illiberal and immoral to train children
to work not freely and intelligently but
for the sake of the work earned in which
case their activity is not free because
not freely participated in and has he
also pointed out it'll be a leaky vessel
those choices contrasting choices are
very sharply drawn today
I'm sure again that most of you have
seen in your own experience I certainly
have myself has very definite policy
implications right now in fact there's
some very recent and reported discussion
of this which I'll quote the
American Association for the Advancement
of science named scientific organization
has a regular journal journal science
and in the last couple of issues of the
editors biochemist Bruce Alberts sets
forth alternatives these alternatives
very clearly he's discussing science
education in the schools but it
generalizes so one approach he discusses
is in fact the Enlightenment view the
teaching is laying out a string on which
the student progresses their own way
sort of discovery and exploration and
his version of it is that our goal is to
make it much easier for teachers
everywhere to provide their students
with laboratory experiences that mirror
the open-ended explorations of
scientists instead of the traditional
cookbook plans where students follow
instructions to a predetermined result
many contrasts that with actual practice
which is of course pretty much the
opposite concepts taught with an overly
strict attention to rules procedures and
rote memorization then he goes on to
quote his own testimony to the
California Standards Commission his
testimony opposing such ideas as
teaching the periodic table of the
elements in fifth grade which really
meaningless to the students incidentally
he points out he was unsuccessful in
this
and what he says is when we teach
children about aspects of science that
they cannot get grasped then we have
wasted valuable educational resources
produced nothing of lasting value and
much worse we take all the enjoyment out
of science when we do so and he
discusses DNA is on field he says
unfortunately most students today are
taught about DNA at such an early age
that they are forced to merely memorize
the fact that is a quote from a textbook
DNA is the material from which genes are
made it's a chore that brings no
enjoyment or understanding whatsoever
and much later he says when they do have
the background to understand both the
structure of the DNA molecule and its
explanatory power I fear that the joy of
discovery has been eliminated by the
early memorization of boring DNA facts
we spoil the beautiful story for them by
teaching it at the wrong time and it
goes on to the college level he says for
example in a introductory biology class
students are often required to learn the
names of the ten enzymes that oxidize
sugars but an obsession with such
details can obscure any real
understanding of the central issue
leaves students with the impression that
science is impossibly dull and costs
many of them
cause as many of them to drop it
tragically we have managed to
simultaneously trivialize and
complicated science education as a
result far too many for far too many the
science seems a game of recalling boring
incomprehensible facts there's so much
so that it may may make little
difference whether the factoids about
science that come from the periodic
table or a movie script and give some
examples again I'm sure you've had your
own experience about that just to
interpolate I certainly have I remember
when I was a 16 year old freshman at the
University of Pennsylvania I had to take
a general chemistry course with about
this many students in the audience
it was insufferably boring and first for
the more is completely obvious what was
going to happen so if you read the
textbook you knew exactly what was going
to happen so I never went to class but
they got a it was okay I had friend who
took notes that helped but the but the
worst part was that they had a lab and I
knew perfectly well that if I went to
the lab and carried out the experiments
none of them would work that's kind of
reflects automatic so in good is what
there's a there was a manual we had to
fill in the answers to the results of
the experiments and again entirely
obvious what they were going to be so I
filled it in you know got an A and so on
but then I had a but then I had a very
unpleasant experience I had to register
for the next semester and when I tried
to register they insisted on my pain a
fee for a breakage in the laboratory
I've never been to the laboratory I
didn't know where it was
but obviously couldn't say that you know
so so I had to pay $17 which was a lot
of money in those days for the breakage
in the lab that I never attended and of
course I remember thinking of course I'm
sure many of you can duplicate this
experience actually now this approach
generalizes even has a name it's called
No Child Left Behind
I see you've experienced that's it's
been going on for about ten years no
reported progress which is no surprise
serious education is radically different
it's what Albert's was recommending and
it's the way science has actually taught
at the advanced levels so take my own
University a mighty it's a research
university
there's a famous world famous physicist
late victor vice cop who's like a lot of
senior faculty top freshman courses and
he used to say that when he came to the
first session of his freshman course and
students would ask what are we gonna
cover this semester and his routine
answer was it doesn't matter what we
cover it matters what you discover and
maybe you'll discover that what I'm
teaching is wrong that would be great
that's the kind of thing we want to do
this goes on right through the graduate
level that's in a serious university
that's all there is it's the whole
curriculum and that's actually possible
all the way down to kindergarten there
are examples so in fact Albert's in this
series of articles it gives a good
example he talks about a kindergarten
class which won some awards and the
sciences his five-year-old kids their
task the task that was given them
each kid in the class was given a dish
that contained scenes pebbles and shells
and their task was to figure out which
ones were the seeds so kids got together
and what they call the scientific
conference and they each had ideas about
how you might do it they
and she ideas suggested some ways of
testing it that you finally carried out
the tests they finally got some way or
little teacher guidance but they're
basically figuring it out for themselves
it ended up at a point at the point
where they were they figured out what
were the seeds and they were dissecting
the seeds they were given magnifying
glasses and could look into it and
locate the embryo which is the source of
the assessment that's learning real
learning that's enlightenment style
learning not No Child Left Behind it can
be done
and sometimes is like in this case
before it too little well let's take a
brief look at the history not
surprisingly the u.s. system of higher
education has evolved along with broader
socio-economic changes that is a very
sharp change at the time of World War
two everything changed after World War
Two was a very dramatic event in world
history the United States had been it
was the richest country in the world but
it wasn't a major actor in the world
scene that the major actors were written
primarily France Germany but not the
United States except regionally but
after World War two it was all different
totally the United States emerged from
World War two with a position of global
dominance that had absolutely no
precedent in history
and no president since began declining
shortly after the United States at that
time had literally fifty percent of the
world's wealth other industrial
societies had been seriously harmed or
devastated for the United States which
was untouched by the war of the war was
a tremendous stimulus huge government
stimulus to the economy the industrial
production quadrupled and it already had
been the richest country in the world I
also had overwhelming position of
security nothing remotely like it
well this affected the whole culture
including education prior to this higher
education least big lead education had
been a kind of a gentlemen's club and
indeed it remained so at the elite
schools will after yeah personal
experience again I was a student at
Harvard in the early 50s and that's
exactly what it was was a gentlemen's
club but the US had also pioneered mass
education through college as well in
fact that's a very important achievement
of American society it was motivated in
part by just what Emerson talked about
who was motivated by the transition from
an agricultural society of free
independent people to an industrial
society was necessary to turn free
farmers into disciplined factory workers
and since they didn't like it
you needed the kind of education that
Emerson was talking about
kind of education will keep them from
our throats and it was dramatic
I mentioned be labored press and it's
very interesting to read factory girls
artisans from the towns they have many
complaints about the system they're
being driven into it's worth reading
it's available now the industrial system
they said was crushing their culture
their dignity their freedom was turning
it them into something like slaves in
fact century and a half ago a very
common belief is so common that it was a
a slogan of the Republican Party that's
poor by Abraham Lincoln was that late
with that wage labor is different from
chattel slavery only in that it's
temporary but other than that it's the
same you're being forced you're working
on command not under your own initiative
so they wanted to get rid of the worker
ownership so on the most interesting I
think the most interesting part element
of their critique was their condemnation
of what they called the new spirit of
the age
remember this is 150 years ago the new
spirit of the age is gained wealth for
getting all but self Adam Smith had
talked about that now he called that the
vile Maxim of the Masters of mankind all
for ourselves nothing for anyone else
and the new spirit of the age
centuries later was to try to
this deeply inhuman idea into people's
heads was a very sharp break from
traditional societies that valued the
trust solidarity mutual aid for common
purposes the in our own tradition the
standard example is the should be the
English Commons we're going to celebrate
it probably won't but we should be
commemorating the 900th anniversary of
the Magna Carta the great Charter in a
couple of months the it's forgotten
theyed Magna Carta is everyone what I
know is the foundation of civil
liberties presumption of innocence trial
by jury the process and so on but it's
sort of forgotten and interestingly that
there were two charters there was a
charter of liberties and there was a
charter of the forests the charter of
the forest it was about preservation of
the Commons the Commons were including
the forests were the possession of
everyone and they were the source of
food of fuel of building materials they
had been carefully cultivated with
mutual aid and mutual support for
centuries so they were very complex
ecosystems which everyone had access to
and the Charter the great Charter that
calls for preservation of the Commons
from the
predatory acts of the king
