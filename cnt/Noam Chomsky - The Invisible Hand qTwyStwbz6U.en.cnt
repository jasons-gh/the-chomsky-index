take the phrase invisible hand everybody
learned that in high school at college
Adam Smith actually did use the term
rarely but take a look at how he used it
in Wealth of Nations as major work it's
used once if you look at the context
it's an argument again against what is
now called neoliberal globalization and
what he argued is this he was concerned
with England of course he said suppose
in England that the merchants and
manufacturers invested abroad and
imported from abroad he said well that
would be profitable for them of Oh buddy
harmful to the people of England however
they will have enough of a commitment to
the wrong country to England what's
called a home bias in the literature
that have enough of home bias so that as
if by an invisible hand
they'll keep to the less profitable
actions and England will be saved from
the ravages of what we call neoliberal
globalization that's the one use of the
term in Wealth of Nations in his other
major work Moral Sentiments terms also
used once and the context is this it's a
remember England's basically an
agricultural continent he says suppose
some landlord that accumulates an
enormous amount of land and everybody
else has to work for him he says well
that well that won't turn out too badly
and the reason is that the landlord will
be motivated by his natural sympathy for
other people so he will make sure that
the necessities of life and the goods
available will be distributed equitably
to the
the people on his lands and it'll end up
with an equal of relatively equal and
just the distribution of wealth as if by
an invisible hand that's his other use
of the term just compare that with what
you're taught in school or what you read
in the newspapers
