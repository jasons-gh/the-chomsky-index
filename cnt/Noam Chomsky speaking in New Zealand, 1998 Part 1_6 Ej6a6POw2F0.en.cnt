academic staff from 36 departments are
present today such is the drawing power
of Noam Chomsky institute professor of
linguistics at MIT the journalism
Department is proud to host Norman Carol
Chomsky a visit made possible by the
foundation for peace studies are tarea
new zealand record on stage by kate jews
professor Chomsky is in New Zealand
primarily to present the media piece
Awards organized by the foundation in
Auckland tonight the journalism
Department has convened judging of the
print section of these awards since 1987
and it is this long association with the
Foundation which opened the way for
professor chomsky's Whistlestop visit to
Christchurch today then Chomsky is
someone for whom the cliche needs no
introduction is absolutely the
appropriate for briefly he transformed
the study of linguistics in the 1960s
and subsequently influenced many
disciplines including psychology and
education changing our ideas about the
human capacity for language and the
workings of the mind turning his
formidable intellect to an analysis of
the widest structures of society he
argued that the ideals of democracy are
subverted by small powerful groups and
has widely acclaimed manufacturing
consent co-written with Edward Herrmann
he developed the propaganda model to
describe the structural features of the
mass media which make them susceptible
to co-option by powerful interests so
much more could be said that let me
simply call on professor Noam Chomsky to
address the topic whose world order
conflicting visions
well I'm have to apologize that it is a
whistle-stop visit and very brief I'm in
the midst of a series of intense series
of talks around the world one of the
frustrations of talks I mean thousands
given over the years but it's always the
same is that the discussion which is
always much more interesting for me and
for the audience is usually curtail I
try to discipline myself to keep the
talk short than the discussion long so
as to minimize that problem and given
the shortness of time today I will
definitely try actually I'll just
mention really a series of topics and
maybe we can pick them up and pursue
them as you be interested also again for
for reasons of shortness of time I'm
going to concentrate primarily on the
United States for one reason because
that's what I know but it's not an
inappropriate choice it's been the
overwhelmingly decisive factor in world
affairs in the last half century remains
far and away the richest most powerful
country in the world it also has long
stable and democratic institutions by
comparative standards and as as good a
model as there is of state capitalist
democracy which is not meant to imply
that it's a very good model thinking of
the future well the record of prediction
in human affairs is not overly
impressive bit of an understatement but
it's not an entirely hopeless task and
if we are willing to take a close look
careful look at where we are and how we
got there trying hard to free ourselves
from the grip of established doctrine
and ideology the
we can get at least I think reasonable
grasp of the likely prospect and more
significant of the options that are
available to shape the future along more
just and humane directions in the coming
years there are a number of very serious
crises that are likely to loom very
large the term crisis has been used so
often that its meaning is somewhat too
based but sometimes it's authentic and
in several cases it really is one is the
crisis of nuclear weapons it's kind of a
miracle that that hasn't destroyed human
civilization and much of the rest in the
last half century and it takes it quite
a lot of faith to a suppose that that
miracle will persist if you look at the
the focus at New Zealand actually has a
stellar record in this regard and is in
a strong moral position to lead the way
in this task that has to be undertaken
to get the to get these monstrous
devices eliminated as long as they exist
life is in very great power the focus is
generally on proliferation so you know
India and Pakistan and Iran and so on
but that misunderstand that's to
misunderstand the dynamics of nuclear
weapons spirit which clearly show that
the problem is in the major nuclear
states which have of course not lived up
to the non-proliferation tree the
non-proliferation treaty and the intent
of the non-proliferation treaty was to
call for nuclear disarmament great
powers would not permit that
nevertheless there is waiting calling
for good faith efforts to rid for the
nuclear powers to rid themselves of
nuclear weapons and of course that has
nothing like that has happened quite the
opposite and if you consider the
dynamics of nuclear weapons spread that
guarantees proliferation so Pakistan has
nuclear weapons to defend itself against
India and India has nuclear weapons to
defend itself against China and China
had nuclear weapons to defend itself
against Russia and Russia had them
because of the interaction with the
United States and it's going to continue
that way and Israel has already had them
for 20 years Iran will have them Iraq
will have them the minute inspectors
leave because all it takes is a
developed industrial infrastructure to
develop nuclear weapons so you either
turn a country into a desert or it's
going to be able to develop nuclear
weapons and one can pretty confidently
predict the proliferation of these
horrors of the more the prolific they
proliferate the greater the dangers and
that will continue by the essential
dynamics of the process until the rot at
the core is illuminated and at the
moment there are no signs of that and
that's an extremely dangerous situation
the other major crisis that everyone is
or ought to be aware of is the
environmental crisis and that could be
extremely serious there's there is a
range of uncertainty about what the
consequences are the business world
which essentially runs the world has
been downplaying the dangers by a very
conscious misinterpretation of the
uncertainty it is quite true that there
is uncertainty so you models of
prediction of climate or you know have a
big plus or minus associated with them
and that has been used consistently in
business propaganda too many media and
so on to would argue that it's
unnecessary take strong steps because
there's a range of uncertainty maybe the
forecasts are overstated there is a
range of uncertainty but that means that
the forecast may be overstated or they
may be understated that's exactly when
uncertainty means and we
no so perhaps the crisis is far more
severe than the scientific consensus or
perhaps it's less severe but minimal
prudence and rationality would indicate
that strong steps ought to be taken to
deal with it in the hope that there's
still time which is not so obvious but
that's a major crisis and cannot be left
to the truck that it's obviously can't
be left to the market in fact the whole
system indicates a radical market
failure there are many reasons why the
market ideology which is trumpeted here
for example and not in many other parts
of the world except by force but here
are unusually voluntarily there are many
reasons why that model is a fraud and is
known to be a fraud one reason is
precisely this the the ones who will pay
the costs of the environmental crisis
even in principle don't have a vote in
the marketplace because they're not
alive well if you study economics that's
called an externality being sort of like
a footnote that you don't have to deal
with but that means that the models are
about as realistic as a model of
terrestrial you know a planetary motion
that called the effect of the Sun and
externality which we bother with will
continue with the nice model and of
course that's only one the cost of oil
is simply unrelated to any meaningful
market principle for one thing because
the long-term costs the externalities
are not calculated at all but for even
for narrower reasons
