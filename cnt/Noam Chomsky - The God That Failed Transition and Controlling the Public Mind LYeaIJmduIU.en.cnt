one of the most prominent modern
American political scientists Harold
Lasswell who was a leading figure in
communications and such things he wrote
the article on propaganda in the
International encyclopedia of social
sciences which was published in 1933 and
in it he says that we should not succumb
to democratic dogmatism about men being
the best judges of their own interests
they are not the best judges are the
elites us smart guys the cool observers
and we must therefore be ensured the
means to impose our will for the common
good of course this he said will require
a whole tech new technique of control
largely through propaganda because of
the ignorance and superstition of the
masses same theme all the way through
the basic problem is this the idea is
that if you have a society in which the
voice of the people is heard you got to
make sure that that voice says the right
thing in totalitarian societies it's not
a big problem
you got a club in your hand and if
people don't behave the right way you
hit them with a club or threaten them
with it so it doesn't really matter much
what they think what matters is what
they do and that you control by force
but as the capacity of the state to
control by force erodes it's necessary
to control what people think and in fact
I think you find much more sophisticated
concern for thought control precisely as
the society becomes more free I don't
think it's surprising that the
sophisticated discussion things like the
public relations industry and the
academic side of it and you know the
journalistic side and all this kinds of
things I've been sampling I suspect if
one did a comparative study you'd find
that they developed primarily in
relatively free societies ours is a very
free society in the sense that the state
has by comparative standards very
limited resources to control by force
and I think it's undoubtedly in fact the
most sophisticated in the terms of in
the reliance on techniques of
indoctrination and control public
relations industry in particular as
American creation you'll notice of
course the close similarity to Leninist
ideology the Bolshevism
which also assumes that the radical
intellectuals are the specialized class
the land guard may have got to lead the
stupid and ignorant masses to a better
society in fact the two conceptions are
very much alike I think that's probably
one of the reasons why there's been
historically such an easy transition
from one to another the move from being
Leninist enthusiasts to a you know a
passionate supporter of state capitalism
and you know working for American aims
that takes place overnight it's been
going on for years it's called the God
that failed transition and it happens
very simply I mean in the early stages
it had some authenticity to it when
people like Ignacio Selena and others
were making this transition but in
recent years has become just a farce
I mean technique of opportunism and the
transition is very easy I think because
there isn't much of a difference in
ideological change it's just a matter of
where you think power lies if you think
there's going to be a popular revolution
and you can ride that revolution to
state power and then wield the whip over
the masses you're a Leninist enthusiast
if you see that that's not going to
happen and power lies in the state
capitalist institutions which you have
to serve as a manager an ideological
manager you do that but it's basically a
very similar position and in fact in the
last century or so since there's been a
more or less identifiable secular
Intelligencia I think you find typically
that they fall into one or the other of
these two categories they associate
themselves with one or the other system
of power and hierarchy and subordination
in fact what I just said is almost a
tautology it's only if you submit to
those systems that you're counted as a
respectable intellectual for obvious
reasons well coming up to more modern
times and the post Second World War
period Carey find again deep concern
over the need to control and deceive the
public
the public mind presidential historian
Thomas Bailey wrote in 1948 at the time
when we were sort of setting off on a
new war the Cold War he wrote because
the masses are notoriously short-sighted
and generally cannot see danger until
it's at their throats our statesmen are
forced to deceive them into an awareness
of their own long-run interests
deception of the people may in fact
become increasingly necessary unless
we're willing to give our leaders in
Washington a freer hand and in 1981 as
the United States was launching a new
crusade for freedom Samuel Huntington
the professor of government at Harvard
said in a private but published
discussion and interchange you may have
to sell intervention or other military
action in such a way as to create the
misimpression but it is the Soviet Union
that you're fighting that's what the
United States has been doing ever since
the Truman Doctrine which is quite
accurate and gives a certain insight
into the nature of the Cold War in
particular into the nature of the war
against Nicaragua which is what he
specifically had in mind
well these concerns over controlling the
public mind tend to rise to the surface
particularly after periods of wars and
turmoil like the 17th century Revolution
the Civil War or like the First World
War when Woodrow Wilson launched the
major Red Scare which is the major
example in modern American history of
all of American history of state
repression that was really large-scale
and effective in destroying unions and
destroying independent politics and
eliminating independent thought and so
on and the same thing happened after
World War two with the phenomenon that's
mislabeled McCarthyism it's mislabeled
because it was actually initiated by the
Liberal Democrats in the late 1940s
McCarthy just came along at the tail end
of it and vulgarized
little the reason for this is and is
that periods of wars and turmoil have a
tendency to arouse people from apathy
and to make them think and to make them
organize often so that's why you get
things like the Red Scare and
McCarthyism right after periods of war
and turmoil and the same thing happened
after the Vietnam War which had the same
effect after the Vietnam War elites were
concerned about what they called a
crisis of democracy in fact one of the
most interesting books on this topic or
one of the most interesting books on
most of the insightful books I think on
modern on the modern democratic system
is called the crisis of democracy it's a
study the only book-length study
published by the trilateral commission
it's important group put together by
David Rockefeller in 1973 and it
represents the more or less liberal
internationalists from the three major
centers of modern capitalism the United
States Western Europe and Japan and its
trilateral and remember this is the
Liberals this is the group out of which
Jimmy Carter and most of his
administration came the quite what's the
crisis of democracy that they're
concerned with in all of the democratic
societies well the crisis is that during
the 1960's large groups of people who
are normally passive and apathetic began
to try to enter the political arena to
press their demands and that's a crisis
which has to be overcome the naive might
call that democracy but that's because
they don't understand the sophisticated
understand that that's a crisis of
democracy the American spokesmen again
Samuel Huntington wrote in his report
that Harry Truman had been able to
govern the country with the cooperation
of a relatively small number of Wall
Street lawyers and bankers in those days
there was no crisis of democracy things
were working just right but in the 1960s
he got all this turmoil I mean young
people and women
you know labor I mean all kinds of weird
people who were supposed to be sitting
quietly and the corners began to get
involved and caused this crisis I mean
the same crisis that arose in the 17th
century and there repeatedly arises when
people begin to try to take advantage of
the formal opportunities that exist
among the terrible things that were
happening during the 60s causing this
crisis they said was that you had this
group of people who they called
value-oriented intellectuals people who
are concerned with things like truth and
justice and all that sort of nonsense
and they're opposed to the good guys the
technocratic and policy oriented
intellectuals they called the common
source that ones who just do the job
which had these value-oriented
intellectuals and they were doing all
sorts of horrible things like under my D
legitimizing the institutions that are
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young like schools and universities
remember this is an internal discussion
so they kind of let their hair down
there are general proposal at the end of
all of this these lengthy and thoughtful
discussions was that what we need is
more moderation and democracy to
mitigate the excess of democracy and
overcome the crisis in plain terms what
that means is that the public has to be
reduced to their proper state of apathy
and obedience and driven from the public
arena if democracy is to survive and the
appropriate sense with the specialized
class you know the cool observers smart
guys the technocratic and policy or an
intellectuals doing our job in the
interests of the people who have real
power
that's the liberal side I won't go into
what the reactionary side says about the
matter well to summarize there is a
standard view of democracy and it's the
view of Justice Powell the public should
assert or the review that he expressed
at least the the view that the public
ought to assert meaningful control over
the political process and there's a
contrary view the contrary view is the
public's a dangerous enemy and has to be
controlled for its own good
of course the way you control children
like you don't let a three-year-old run
across the street the first view is the
rhetorical view the second view is the
view that's actually held and you can
see that it's actually held when a
crisis of democracy erupts and the
unwashed masses begin to try to enter
into the political arena and have to be
somehow repressed either by force as in
the Red Scare or by other means in order
to overcome the crisis of democracy well
with regard to the media play a big role
in this and with regard to the media too
there is a standard view the standard
view for example is expressed again by
justice Powell and the same discussion
when he claims that it's the crucial
role of the media to affect the societal
purpose of the First Amendment that is
to it
allow the public to assert control of
the political process standard view was
also expressed by Judge Gurfein in an
important decision the Pentagon Papers
decision when he permitted the New York
Times to publish the Pentagon Papers and
he said we have a cantankerous press an
obstinate press that ubiquitous press
and it must be suffered by those in
authority in order to preserve the even
greater values of freedom of expression
and the right of the people to know
that's one view that's the standard view
and given that view we then have a
debate the debate is over whether the
Kover whether the media have gone too
far in their defiance of Authority and
their adversarial stance the right-wing
claims they've gone too far they're
overcome by a liberal bias we've got to
do something about it the Liberals as in
the trilateral commission all in fact
agree they in the same study they say
that the media threaten government
authority by their adversarial stance
and they've got to be curved
if they can't curb themselves the
government is going to move in the curve
curb them the executive director of
Freedom House Leonard Sussman asked
whether free institutions must be a must
free institutions be overthrown by the
very freedom they sustain rhetorical
question meaning we got
do something about this excess freedom
that the press is using to attack the
government he was writing about the
freedom house study of the coverage the
Tet Offensive which became a sort of a
classic allegedly showing that the press
lost the war in Vietnam by unfair
criticism of the government during the
Tet Offensive it's an interesting if
there's no time to talk about it
I may try to get back to it if not maybe
get through the discussion very
interesting study it was total fraud
falsified the data you know the whole
thing was faked when you actually
correct the errors it turns out that the
press that the real charge of Freedom
House was that the press although
completely supportive of the government
policy and working completely within the
framework of government propaganda
nevertheless was too pessimistic they
said they didn't tell you by what
standards it was too pessimistic the
obvious standard is to compare it with
say internal US intelligence assessments
which we have thanks to the Pentagon
Papers and it turns out the press was
more optimistic than US intelligence
because they were believing the public
statement and they know about the
private statements so Freedom House's
complaint reduces to the fact that the
press though those totally supportive of
the propaganda didn't do it in an upbeat
enough fashion I wouldn't have surprised
George Orwell that that should be the
criticism of the press produced by an
organization called Freedom House but
that's become the that's become the
standard since everyone refers to that
as the study that proves that the press
was too adversarial well that's the
debate then then the defenders of the
press say no we're not to adversary or
maybe we are too adversarial but you got
to tolerate us even though we're
cantankerous and so on that's
essentially the issue well outside of
that debate between those who say the
press is too adversarial and must be
curbed and those who say well yes the
presses can't anchor isn't impossible
but we just have to suffer that managers
of freedom outside the spectrum of that
debate which constitutes virtually the
entire mainstream discussion virtually
the entire discussion but
outside the debate there is another
position the other position challenges
the factual consumption that's taken for
granted in the debate according to this
alternative view the media do indeed
fulfill a societal purpose but a very
differently their societal purpose is to
inculcate and defend the economic and
social and political agenda of the
privileged groups that dominate the
domestic society and they do this in all
sorts of ways they do it by selection of
topics by distribution of concern by the
way they frame issues by filtering of
information by emphasis and tone by
simple fabrication sometimes but
crucially by the bounding of debate to
make sure that it doesn't go outside of
certain limits the bounding both in the
news columns and in the opinion columns
because of course the news columns
themselves embody all sorts of
assumptions and ideological
presuppositions and so on to the
according to this alternative view to
the extent that there is a liberal bias
it serves primarily to bound thinkable
thought that is to instill the
unchallengeable assumptions which in
fact reflect this rather narrow elite
consensus so the liberal bias performs a
real function it says thus far and no
further as far as you can go and I go as
far how far I go is still accepting the
basic presuppositions as unchallengeable
now within those bounds there's ample
controversy and it reflects the tactical
divisions among elites over how to
achieve generally shared aims but these
limits are very rarely transcendent so
the media thus function in accordance
with what my co-author Edward Herrmann
and I have called a propaganda model in
a recent book that's another view well
the propaganda model has a lot of
predictions as a lot of predictions
about how the press is going to behave
but it also has a further prediction the
further prediction is that no matter how
well confirmed the propaganda model is
it cannot be taken seriously
and therefore must be effectively
excluded from mainstream discussion
that actually follows from the model
itself the reason is that the model if
you think it through the model rejects
certain principles that are serviceable
to power that is it falls outside the
spectrum defined by the presupposition
that the media are adversarial and
cantankerous perhaps excessively so now
that presupposition is a useful one it's
serviceable to the interests of
established institutions to believe that
what you're reading is actually
criticism if it's in fact support that's
a technique it's a sophisticated
technique of indoctrination
and of course it's very serviceable to
the media themselves it's nice to think
that you're you know pride yourself on
being an independent that courageous
adversary of power and since those
assumptions are serviceable they're
going to be upheld according to the
propaganda model and no serious
challenge will be permitted
so that prediction indeed is very
readily confirmed the propaganda model
has never taken seriously it can't be
considered notice that the propaganda
model has a rather disconcerting feature
to it plainly as a matter of logic it's
either valid or invalid if it's invalid
you can dismiss it if it's valid you
must dismiss it
