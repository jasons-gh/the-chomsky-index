We have little information about what the thought is 
There is no clarity as to how to obtain such information 
However, much of our knowledge of thought appears through language, so this leads to considering language and thought as one thing 
But you can also look carefully at that if you like 
It's the only evidence we have, but it doesn't look as though they are the same 
There seem to be many types of thought that cannot be divided and clear. And I see no reason to suspect that some kind of thought occurs without a live structure and has no language 
There is a huge project in computational cognitive science, and I think it is a waste of time 
Which is due to the wrong reading of a short research paper written by "Allen Turing" in 1950, a mathematician who found modern computational sciences and so on. 
He had a research paper called something like Do the Machines Think! 
He designed a test, now called the "Turing Test" and called it "a game of imitation". 
And there was a lot of effort to try anything he discussed or explain what he said 
If the machine was, and here is a god in the sense of a program and not a physical computer, then if the program was able to succeed in that test, then this shows us that he is thinking 
If you are an employee of "IBM: a computer manufacturer," you will be paid to build "Watson: a computer that answers questions" or software that is supposed to pass the test. 
And, as you know, they defeat humans in chess, or gyardy, or something 
With each one of them you can get a hundred thousand dollars if you designed such programs 
There is one line in Turing's research paper and it seems neglected 
What he said is, "The question of whether machines think is empty and does not deserve controversy." 
He is right. Question What do you think or not? Like a question, let's say, if a submarine is swimming! If you want to call that a swim, it does swim and vice versa. 
But it is not a real question but rather a human space, I think in Japanese they do it, someone told me, but in English no. 
But these are not real questions, they are only questions of how to use the word 
Something is happening now which is freely referred to as the thought, but we do not know much about what it is 
I will not discover this as long as interest is restricted by the reach of perception 
Some of you may know that there are recent experimental results showing that decisions made about the action of a machine, for example "pick this up", the decision was actually made in parts of a second before you were conscious of making a decision 
Indeed, this has been misunderstood as a controversy of free will, but has nothing to do with it. What this means is that the decisions were made in a way that is not attainable 
I don't think it surprises you, anybody alive and think about what they are doing 
But it is contrary to the principle of belief, and I believe that these principles will collapse unless we take note of these things
