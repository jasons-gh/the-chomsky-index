us too Regt people's minds as
efficiently as armies regiment their
bodies and we must do this first of all
it's the essential feature of democracy
but also sort of footnote it's the way
to maintain power structures and
authority structures and wealth and so
on roughly the way it is it's worth
remembering something else that they
usually don't teach you very much about
it in school and that is if you back to
the origins of American society it was
founded on the principle that was stated
very explicitly by the leading framer
James Madison at the constitutional
conventions that the as he put it the
primary responsibility of government is
to protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority I and Madison
recognized eyes smart guy that this was
going to be a serious problem if the
democratic system were established it
was going to if people had the right to
vote hehe used England as his model
England was the model for democracy in
those days right it's like government
1780s and he pointed out in the debates
on the Constitutional Convention
something which everybody would have
read in third grade in a free society I
mean this is the origins of our society
you know he pointed out that in England
if they had the right to vote which
fortunately they didn't he said pretty
soon you would find people calling for
redistribution of property and for a tax
on property rights for what nowadays we
call agrarian reform was mostly an
agricultural society he didn't use the
term agrarian or form but same thing he
said people will start calling for
agrarian reform obviously that's
intolerable and we have to protect our
own society against that kind of
injustice by protected by ensuring that
the rights of property prevail he
recognized that he says problem now he
was already concerned in the 1780s by
what he called symptoms of a leveling
spirit that is people are trying to
you know feel that property oughta me
were more equitably distributed that's a
danger but he said that the danger is
going to become much more severe over
time as more and more people are
marginalized and dispossessed and
secretly yearn for a more a equal
distribution of life's blessings now if
those people get the vote we're going to
be in trouble because it's going to be
hard to protect the minority the opulent
against the majority which is what
governments all about and he therefore
designed the constitutional system which
was intended to prevent that danger the
system the way he's set it up he and the
other framers but was virtually
unanimous and virtually no disagreement
about this the the one person who might
have disagreed Jefferson was not part of
any of this stuff the he the
constitutional system as he designed it
was supposed to put power in the hands
of the wealthy who are the more capable
set of men I'm quoting and power must
reside in the hands of the wealthy the
more capable set of men with the general
population fragmented factionalized
dispersed you know in conflict and so on
and so forth well this is like we're not
1780s okay it's in a pretty stable
system and as it's been harder as the
franchise has increased so over time
more and more people did get the right
to vote and that just raised the danger
furthermore the the power of the state
to coerce by violence by this and that
includes the power of private power like
the power of say Carnegie to hire banger
tins and so on as that has declined the
need to resort to these other method
measures of factional ization instilling
hatred marginalizing people straight
propaganda
so on that's increased and very
consciously so by the time you get to
the 1920s where I started from it's
recognized that huge resources must go
into the conscious manipulation of the
organized habits and opinions of the
masses now we have to regiment them
their minds as well as an army regiments
their bodies and we have the methods for
it and those methods are advertising
entertainment straight propaganda in the
media schools so on and so forth the 20s
was an important period in this regard
it looks as if labors under attack now
but remember in the 20s it had been
smashed the major American historian of
labor historian David Montgomery has a
book which you probably know or should
if you don't call the halt the fall of
the house of labor very you know sort
standards important book on history the
labor movement it ends in the 1920s
because that's when the house of labor
had fallen and after with a lot of
violence in that case state violence
Wilson's Red Scare the leading labor
leader was in jail Eugene Debs where the
New York Times had said years ago I
ought to be sent and so on it was there
had been a big strike wave in the during
the at the end of the First World War
smashed labor movement destroyed the
whole thing wiped out as Montgomery
points out at the end of his book labor
had been virtually destroyed working
people had to privatize their lives and
aspirations they sort of work out
survival strategies for themselves not
with others because the modes of
cooperation and common struggle had been
eliminated and they did it he ends up by
saying you know in a most undemocratic
America which is true it was a highly on
democratic country using a combination
of modes of violence and coercion and
repression and increasingly propaganda
to prevent the dangers that Madison was
worrying about you know almost 200 years
earlier that more and more people would
secretly sigh
for a better better access to life's
blessings and might even do something
about it if they had a functioning
democracy which therefore couldn't be
permitted I should just comment in
fairness to James Madison that this
these remarks are not quite correct the
reason was that Madison was
pre-capitalist he's like just about
everybody you know Adam Smith you know
all the great figures from the
Enlightenment they're mostly
pre-capitalist and very anti capitalist
in conception you know you can't say
they're anti-capitalist because there
was no modern industrial capitalism
around for them to have an opinion about
and there's a matter of interpretation
you know not how you read text so you
can read them a lot of different ways
but the way I read them they were very
anti capitalist that includes adam smith
and i think you can demonstrate that I
but certainly Madison was he believed
that when he put power in the hands of
the wealthy class of men you know the
more capable set of men the wealthy of
the country that they were going to be
as he put it enlightened statesmen and
benevolent philosophers who would devote
themselves through the welfare of all
okay that's a very pre-capitalist
conception you know that once you give
power to the hands of the rich they're
just going to be benevolent philosophers
and they're going to devote themselves
you know every minute of their day to
the welfare of everyone else I mean it's
like what corporate executives tell you
you know they're sort of understanding
have to say that but by now nobody I
suppose nobody believes except the
people who read these you know watch
these movies which show you how it works
in those days Madison really believed it
and he very quickly discovered that it
wasn't true within a few years but
listen I think 1792 he was already very
upset about the fate of this democratic
experiment which he thought was failing
he condemned what he called the daring
depravity of the time
the business leaders who have now been
given power used that power he said to
become the tools and tyrants of
government they overwhelm government
with their powers and combinations and
they're bribed by its large esses and
they're just serving self-interest you
know not the interest of the general
public and he thought I was deplorable
and the so on but that's because in the
end he perceived the way the system that
he had designed was actually functioning
that description you know rhetoric is
kind of nice some people don't use fancy
rhetoric like that today but it's a
perfect description of today what's
called the industrial capitalist system
today is in fact one in which private
power is the tool and tyrant of
government overwhelms it by its
combinations it's bribed by its large
asus that's a pretty good description of
1997 with all the changes that have
taken place in 1792 there's a good deal
of stability to all this including the
commitment to the principle that the
primary goal of government is to protect
the minority the opulent from the
majority read yesterday's budget
proposal carefully and you'll get a good
example of how that commitment plays
itself out and the increasingly
significant idea increase overwhelmingly
significant idea particularly among
liberals you know like saber knives that
it is necessary to control people's
minds because they're too much of a
danger the end we as one of the leading
take a look at that say the Encyclopedia
of Social Sciences in big encyclopedia
in 1933 so this is still pretty Second
World War there's an entrance act as an
entry on propaganda remember propaganda
was a usable permanent and the entry on
propaganda is written by a very
distinguished political scientist
liberal political scientist Harold
Lasswell one of the founders of modern
political science in fact of
communications and so on and it's worth
reading the pager too you know
xerox it out and read it he says these
are paraphrases but they're pretty close
to quote the he says that we must not
succumb to democratic dogmatism about
people being the best judges of their
own interests they are not you know
we're the best judges of their interests
we smart guys and we must therefore
ensure that those idiots out there don't
get into trouble you know by actually
using their theoretical right to vote to
interfere where they don't belong like
in the public arena so yeah keep them
out of the public arena somehow and make
sure that it's just a smart guys who are
in there now it's for their good of
course it's kind of like you don't let
you know your three-year-old my case
grandchild run across the street you
know because she may want to run across
the street but the beyond improper glare
have that choice and the same is true
about the masses they have to be
controlled they have to be controlled at
the workplace they have to be kept out
of the political arena they're not going
to understand the need to protect the
minority the op 1 against the majority
they're going to have all these strange
leveling impulses and they're going to
do all kind of things which will you
know mess the world up in all sorts of
horrible ways so for their benefit we
have to regiment their minds the way in
army regiments their bodies ensure that
they're under control make it very clear
that they don't participate in workplace
management and certainly not in
political arena there to be outside
somewhere and the dedication with it
with which this task has been pursued is
pretty awesome I if you I mean just to
take a right after the fall of the house
of Labor in the 1920s when American
labor really was smashed and people were
privatized and tried to accommodate
individually to a most undemocratic
America is Montgomery and others have
pointed out that was a time when there
was great sort of
you know about the end of history and
the Utopia the masters and it's all over
you know us good guys at one everybody
else is at our feet kind of like some of
the stuff you read the day I and it sort
of looked like that you know it's pretty
much looked that way well a few years
laters you know the whole thing
collapsed and there was militant working
class struggle and all sorts of other
popular activism and there had to be an
accommodation I'd be some kind of
accommodation to the to these unwashed
masses that we're getting out of line
sit-down strikes and all sorts of things
and there was indeed there was this
fragile social compact that the Doug
Fraser referred to was indeed
established I wasn't in a gift you know
it was won by struggle and the meaning
will labor laws and the limited social
system in fact the American workers back
in the 1930s began to get the rights
that had been standard long before even
in much more brutal societies you read
the right-wing British press over the
say early part of this century they
can't believe how bad American workers
are treated the same was true of
visitors from Australia and so on by the
1930s the US was sort of brought into
the more or less the main screen of
industrial society on these matters to a
limited extent in fact but to some
extent and that cost hysteria among the
Masters so you read the business press x
19 36 or 37 again these are things which
in a really free society everybody would
study in elementary school because
they're really important that these give
the real framework of the society in my
view the they were talking about the
hazard facing industrialists and the
rising political power of the masses and
how we must do something to save
ourselves or our way of life will be
gone and we know a lot of time to do it
they started right away by the late 30s
there was a big anti-labor campaign that
had built up its with new techniques you
know there was still use of force
but it was understood that that's not
going to work the way it did so there
was a shift to more propaganda community
Oregon the main idea it's called a
Johnston the Mohawk Valley formula I
guess that was cool something like that
yeah Mohawk Valley formula was designed
by a lot of public relations hotshots
around 36 37 at the time of some of the
steel strikes to have a new what they
called scientific methods of strike
breaking we don't just come in you know
with clubs and shoot people and smash
their heads and that sort of thing we do
it the scientific way because the old
way doesn't work anymore and the
scientific methods of strike breaking
were in fact drawn from the public
relations ideas of the kind of that I
talked about the main idea was to
mobilize the community against the
strikers and the union activists to
present a picture which is by now so
standard you can hardly turn on the tube
without seeing it because it's just
poured out and you know like streams
ever since then the basic idea is to
present a picture of the world that
looks now like this there's there's us
you know kind of big happy family in the
community the you know the honest
workmen going off every morning with his
lunch box his loyal wife who's making
the meals and taking care of the kids
the hard-working executive who's toiling
day and night and the interests of you
know his workers in the community the
friendly banker who's running around
looking for people to lend money to and
so on and so forth that's us you know
and we're all in harmony harmony was a
big word we're in harmony we're all
together it's Americanism you might take
a look at that word Americanism it's an
unusual term it's the kind of term that
you only find in totalitarian societies
as far as I know so like in the Soviet
Union anti-soviet ISM was considered the
gravest of all crimes you know and the
Brazilian generals had some concept like
that Andy Brazilian but try say posing a
book on anti-italian ISM and see what
happens in the streets of
normal on people won't even bother
laughing so ludicrous idea the idea of
Italian ism or you know norway ism or
something like that or just be obvious
ridicule and societies that have some
kind of residue of a democratic culture
inside people's heads i don't mean in
the formal system but in totalitarian
societies it is used and as far as I
know the United States is the only free
society that has such a concept maybe
there's another one if it might try it
in place as you know but anyhow
Americanism is an anti-americanism an
done Americanism and so on these are
concepts which go along with harmony and
getting rid of those outsiders and all
that kind of stuff another part is
simply to induce hatred hatred fear
among people so it's a diverse society
you know you go to Europe most places
are pretty uniform this is a very
diverse society so it's easy for
propagandists it's pretty easy to get
people to you know hate the guy next
door because looks a little different
there one thing or another and huge
campaigns go on to instigate divisions
among people I don't tell you about this
it's also familiar you go on but but
these are very natural techniques of
social control if you can't control
people by force you have to control
their minds you have to control their
attitudes yet exactly like they say well
going back to the Mohawk Valley formula
the idea was to move into a community
flood it with where there's a strike
going on flood it with propaganda you
know take over the media the churches
the schools I've been everywhere else
poor in this propaganda about harmony
and so on the way I described it and
then there's those bad guys out there
we're trying to disrupt our harmonious
lives you know like that union
organizers probably a communist
anarchist anyway and probably unamerican
than he's trying to you know destroy all
these wonderful things we have and we
got to band together and kick him out
you know we have to defend their way of
life against this a lot of religion gets
thrown in remember that the United
States an extremely fundamentalist
country I mean you look comparatively
comparative statistics it usually
religious
mentalism declines as industrialization
goes up its pre close correlation the
United States is off the chart you know
it ranks with devastated peasant
societies probably more fundamentalist
than a grant there's all why this is so
is I don't know but I'm in fact
complicated question but one factor is
that it was certainly consciously
fomented by Business Leaders that goes
way back to the 19th century when they
were supporting their favored I mean
John Dee Rockefellers favor and
evangelist was a hoot a lot of money
into a some guy who said that people
ought to have more enlightened ideas
than labor agitation that was one of his
famous phrases and the more enlightened
ideas are you know go to church and
listen to orders and you know do what
they tell you and shut up you know
that's the more enlightened ideas and
it's a really interesting case because
the Mohawk Valley was the model that was
later used for strike breaking and
destruction of the labor movement in the
post-war period so it's quite
interesting to see what happened right
there instantly I know any literature on
this do you yes it's these these are
untouchable topics you know and you can
almost say that anything that's
important you know it's going to matter
for people's lives it's got to be sort
of off the agenda and it sort of makes
sense you don't want people to know
about it like you don't want people to
know the wrong kind of thing after all
that makes sense you know it's like it's
not a conspiracy or anything it's just
common sense if you have a certain
degree of power and authority and
privilege you just don't want people to
know things that might be harmful to
them because they're really like
children remember and we're the ones who
have to make the decisions would there's
an enormous amount of money and effort
goes into this it's not the only thing
but any means there's a lot of other
reasons why the United States is so
unusual in this respect but this is one
of them and it's used I mean whether
that's the source or not it's certainly
used you know always another technique
of trying to create the marginalization
of people the removing people from the
actual social and political struggles
that might make their lives better you
know maybe they and to keep them from
working with one another by dividing
all sorts of ways and in a myriad
techniques you know find the fashion to
keep the hated masses with out of the
public arena where they don't belong and
certainly out of anything having to do
with control of the economic system
where it's unthinkable that they should
have a role that's got to be in the
hands of private Erinyes that's
unquestionable where the United States
has acted internationally it's the same
way you look at the trail of
intervention it's almost always the same
not just third-world countries for
example like I just came back from Italy
okay you may not know this but Italy was
the target of the major CIA activities
since its origins the internal record
runs dry around the mid 70s so don't
know can't say after that but from the
origin of the CIA in 1947 up to at least
the mid 70s Italy seems to have been
targeted more than any other country in
an effort to undermine Italian democracy
Italy was regarded as sort of a third
semi third world country had a very
strong labor movement and when the
American army in fact the American
British Army's what they did what they
called liberating Italy in nineteen
forty-three forty-four they were
appalled to discover that northern Italy
had been liberated by the resistance
which had established the functioning
society with very strong labor control
the resistance was mostly labor and
peasant based they held off the Germans
had liberated most of the place they had
instituted labor worker management in
factories they had thrown out what were
called what these Americans and British
they had they were protecting workers
what they call you I'm now speaking for
the terminology of the u.s. British
documents they were keeping useless
workers and throwing out arbitrarily
dismissing owners and bosses and that's
of course intolerable
and the system was functioning I further
where they were focusing on unemployment
which was recognized was Italy's major
problem but that's their problem not our
prob our problem is to restore the
traditional structure which meant
traditional hierarchies actually it
meant restoring fascist structures and
fascist collaborators and so on and our
big effort was made to do that and it
was did not entirely successful by 1948
when the first election took place it
looked as if Labour based forces would
probably win and a huge effort went into
trying to ensure that that wouldn't
happen by withholding food Italy was
starving by restoring the police to
fascist control by all sorts of threats
and manipulation pretty big operation
and the first major CIA operation among
others and they took it really seriously
again something you would learn in a
free society is this thing called the
National Security Council you know which
the main planning outfit which publishes
doesn't publish but it produces
documents top-level planning documents
which are among not the only important
ones but among the most important ones
they tend to get released maybe 35 years
later so you can look back at them so we
have them now from the late 40s and the
first one NSC one 1947 is devoted Italy
and it calls for it says you know we're
going to try all these measures to
ensure that Italy doesn't have a free
democratic government which would have
don't say it this way but what amounts
do that which in which there'd be a big
role for the organized working class in
Italy but and they say but if this
doesn't work you know if the Communists
as they call them which means in fact a
lot of work nominees but if the
Communists comes power through a legal
vote for illegal elections then the
United States is going to declare a
national emergency and is going to
support military activities inside Italy
to overthrow the democratically elected
government that's how seriously they
took it back in 1947 they also knew
exactly why the Communists were powerful
on you read it in the records
extensively because they were honest
because they were supporting working
class
interests it's true that they were
collaborationists they weren't trying to
separate Italy from the Western alliance
or anything but they were defending
working class interests and people
supported and at a mass based working
class party there were plenty of others
besides communist but they had to be
prevented either by coercion likes a
withholding food and violence or if that
didn't work by direct intervention
military intervention that was taken
very seriously and in fact it goes up to
the present you know how was it the
wealthy chin will pull the wool over the
eyes of the American worker by
controlling the power and government and
using it against the work in public use
it against waiver well take right now
let's say as an example there's a couple
days ago I don't know if your father I
put myself through the pain of reading
the New York Times every day for some
masochistic reason which I won't try to
explain but the the they've got a you
know their big chief correspondence or
the main thinker as a guy named Thomas
Friedman who had an article three or
four days ago in which he big think
piece in which he said well he said the
Cold War is over so you know the
breakdown isn't hawks and doves anymore
we have to have some new breakdown and
he said the new breakdown he says
there's two one is between
integrationists and was the other term I
forget you know aunty integration is
that means people are in favor of more
globalization and what they call free
trade which isn't free trade and all
that kind of stuff and people who want
to slow it down or end it that's one
break and the other is between people
who are in favor of a safety net and
those who think that everybody ought to
you know be on your own and get what you
can okay so those are the two ways
people break up and I can see for
possible types of people right two of
them he sort of dismisses as lunatics so
there's this apathy stays in ross perot
they fit into two of those boxes the
other two boxes are sort of saying
people clinton and gingrich and i'll put
aside gingrich Clinton but Gingrich and
it's right to your point I think
Gingrich is put in the corner that says
integrationist and that will take behind
most you know everybody for themselves
well that's testable no it's testable
that that's Gingrich is positioned for
example on the question of whether
gingrich's and integrationist like in
favor of free trade we can ask how he
reacted when the Reagan administration
instituted the greatest wave of
protectionism since the 1930s that's
just straight protectionism alongside of
huge increase in public subsidies
through private power to industry along
with say the biggest nationalization in
American history to take over
continental Illinois bank and so on and
so forth that's all radically an
integrationist okay I hadn't inger to
react we can ask that question answer is
he thought it's great you know but what
about the safety net story I mean
Gingrich is in favor of people sort of
being out there on their own you know a
rugged entrepreneurs and so on I mean
you can check that too he represents the
county district Cobb County Georgia
which happens to be that and he happens
to hold the national championship in
bringing federal subsidies to his rich
constituents to be precise among
suburban counties in the United States
Cobb County ranks third in federal
subsidies ranks right after arlington
virginia which is part of the federal
government's of course they get a lot of
federal subsidies like the Pentagon's
there and so on and brevard county
florida which is the home of the Space
Center so it's another part of the
federal government but if you move
outside the federal government itself
gingrich's district is number one they
get more federal subsidies than anybody
the biggest employer in cobb county is
locking which is a publicly subsidized
private profit corporation they don't
you know I mean they sell plant
commercial planes but those are just as
everyone knows they're just
you know kind of they use military
technology is that the way the system is
designed technology is developed under
the guise of the military and then hand
it over to private power when when it
works let us draw everything airplanes
computers the internet you name it and
Cobb County is right center this well
he's in favor of being you know y'all
out on your own and fighting in this
harsh world ridiculous he's the biggest
welfare freak in the country that's
literally true except that he wants the
welfare to go to very rich people notice
this is not what's called corporate
welfare the corporate wealth with a call
corporate welfare which repulsive ever
gets touched to some different category
completely that's like giving a special
you know shot in the arm to some
particular corporation this is something
quite different this is the way in which
our economy works the way our economy
works take any dunt just about any
dynamic sector of it you know at least
that I know and I've studied and you
find that it's based on massive public
subsidy and privatization of profit
public pays the costs and takes the
risks and private systems make the
profit if there is any Cobb County is
just an extreme example of this
not you ask how come people are deluded
well how often do you read this you know
i mean like these aren't particularly
subtle facts I mean these are like
glaringly obvious fact but okay because
the reason is because people like Thomas
Friedman and everyone else in the
business knows you're not supposed to
write about these things i mean i don't
know i'm not claiming he thinks about it
you know in fact the people who write
about it are probably more deeply
propagandized that even and the people
they're talking to you know you cannot
be a good propagandist unless it's in
your bones I mean it's extremely hard to
lie I think we all know that from
personal experience you know it's hard
the light of people every one of us lies
to people all the time unless we're some
kind of crazy angel but the way we do it
if you I'm sure you know this is you
first convince yourself that what you're
saying is true you know like your you
know your eight-year-old you're an
eight-year-old kid and you steal a toy
from your brother you know and your
mother comes in and yells at you you
don't say well you know I wanted to
throw and he had it so you know I took
it because I'm stronger than him what
you say is it really wasn't his and
besides he'd taken a toy of mine and
anyway I needed more than he did so it
was right for me to take okay you know
I'm if people that haven't had that
experience there are some other species
that you think but that kind of
experience goes all the way up to being
a hotshot journalist for The New York
Times you know you don't even make it
into those circles unless you're already
so deeply overwhelmed by doctrine and
propaganda that you can't even think in
other terms and so you'll read say you
know liberal columnist in New York Times
very angrily saying when people talk
like this nobody tells me what to write
I write anything I feel like which is
absolutely true and if they didn't if
you know people with real power weren't
sure that they were going to say the
right things they wouldn't be in a
position to write anything they feel
like
well how does that work you know it
starts from childhood it starts in
kindergarten on television there's
selection for obedience from the very
first moment you just think about I'm
guessing maybe I'm wrong so you tell me
I'm wrong but at least when I think
about my own school experience or any
other school experience I know about
there was selection for obedience I mean
I ended up going to the fancy colleges
like this place and the way I did it was
I know exactly how i did it by shutting
up you know like if I thought that the
high school teacher was a horse's ass
which I did most of the time I didn't
say hey what you're saying actually
sometimes I did got thrown out of class
but I learned not to say anything just
say okay you know I'll do the next
stupid assignment and because I know
that that's the way I get ahead and
ultimately all do this and that alright
and you know you if you're having you
know whatever ability it takes to do
this kind of thing and you are
sufficiently disciplined and passive you
sort of make it through up to the higher
echelon there are people who don't I
mean I know something like somebody on
kids just didn't and they get in trouble
they're called behavior problems or you
know disruptive or you stick drugs in
them or something or other because
they're just too independent you know
and people who are independent or pan a
knack you know they disrupt the system
and then they're going to be cut off one
way or another I can tell you just you
know at graduate school teaching mostly
graduates will you read applications you
can detect between the lines when the
person who's writing a recommendation is
telling you keep away from this person
they're going to cause you trouble which
means usually they're going to go off
and do the wrong thing or something like
that I it's it's III don't want to
exaggerate in the sciences it's somewhat
different and the reason is the sciences
simply require this kind of independence
they'll die you know unless people are
challenging all the time and questioning
so when you look at people who are say
studying physics at MIT or something
yeah it's totally different because you
just incur
people to be challenging and creative
and so on and so forth but in most areas
you don't you you want them to be
passive and obedient and supportive and
to fit there you know to fit some kind
of niche inside a managerial system
which is top-down and then make too much
of a fuss and so on and the people who
don't accept this there weeded out and
one or another fashion so it's a tricky
question i don't mean it's just as an
easy answer to your question or if there
is i don't know it but it seems to be
the awful out of our whole system of the
kind of thought control by that i mean
education you know television family
life all sorts of things is sort of
geared to supporting that kind of
passivity and institutions to the break
out of it as the labor movement does
they are subject to a lot of their
crushed insofar as one confession I mean
the labor movement always broke out of
this its picture was always different
from the very beginning you go back to
the beginnings of labor movement it's
you know farmers bitterly opposing the
degrading and oppressive modes of
industrial capitalist organization that
we're being forced on them actually one
of the most interesting books I know and
if you haven't read it I urged you to is
the first modern book on labor history
that I know of by a guy named Norman
we're around 1924 it was just reprinted
so it's easy to get but it's about the
labor movement in eastern Massachusetts
around eighteen fifty and sixty it's
mostly quotes from the labor pres which
are just fascinating it's mostly young
women from the farms what they called
factory girls like 18 year old kid comes
in from the farms and she's working on
the mills and Lowell or artisans and
Boston you know and people like that
they they're unpressed they're very
lively extensive press big in fact it's
like the scale of the commercial press
in the States
that's very interesting I mean it's very
eloquent very well written they took for
granted as the labor movement always has
unless it's beaten out of people's heads
that those who work in the mills ought
to own them they regarded industrial
capitalism is just another form of
slavery this is without you know no
marks no socialism you know no foreign
radicals none of that stuff it's all
just working people from their own
experience you know very literate
incidentally likely one of the things
they complained about was that their
culture was being taken away from like
an artisan in Boston if he had the
lecture money would hire a boy to read
to him and that meant read classics you
know they and they regarded the they
said look the values that we fought for
in the American Revolution they're being
taken away from us we're being forced
into another kind of tyranny which we
don't want namely the tyranny of the
hierarchic industrial system and they
also opposed the what they called the
new spirit of the age this is like 1850
the new spirit of the age is gained
wealth for getting all but self okay
never hear that one a little fancier but
the same thing that is drilled and
everyone's head every day today you know
you got to gain wealth forgetting about
everybody else while they were trying to
drill it into people's heads in 1850 and
they were resisting it because it's
degrading you know it's not the way
human beings are takes a long time to
drive normal human sentiments out of
people's hit and they keep popping up
again and in fact I think that looks to
me the whole history of the labor
movement is a struggle against the new
spirit of the age well that's one of the
reasons it's constantly repressed and
other independent efforts are also
constantly repressed not always
successfully like the world's a lot
better than it was 100 years ago or 50
years ago for that matter because these
struggles tend to you know they get
repressed but they leave a residue they
have successes and they're beaten back
and then they go on from those successes
and over time it's already gets better
structures that are based on authority
and dominance will try to repel just
normally act with anybody even thinking
about it to block such tendencies now
sometimes they think about it like in
these in the manuals of the public
relations industry they think about a
very harsh but you know they're putting
out the billions of dollars a year to
control the public mind better think
about what you're doing but most of the
time you don't think about it you're
just part of it like you know think
about the fact that when you go through
school you're being trained for
obedience and passivity but I think if
you look back you'll probably least if
you're like my experience will recognize
that that happened and when you watch
television let's say if you know some
sitcom you don't think well I'm being
exposed to the Mohawk Valley formula but
you are I mean that's the picture of
life that's presented day after day
after day on you know like people have
personal problems or something like that
but nothing that would bring them
together to work for some you know to
struggle against the new spirit of the
age I mean it's last time you saw I said
come about that and in fact what you
what you get is this exists uffz that
flows out of the pr industry very
consciously no I'm not in that case
mostly conscious another aspect of it is
demonizing labor so a major element in
the huge public relations propaganda
after the Second World War you know was
strictly demonizing labor and the labor
movement knew that you know there was a
fairly substantial labor press even and
then as late as the 1950s there were
still about 800 labor newspapers which
are reaching maybe 20 or 30 million
people a week you know not commercial
media but pretty substantial and they're
interesting reading too they were struck
they were trying to as they put it
provide this is just I'm not talking
about anything radical you know it's
like no left-wing press or anything just
labor newspapers you know the
conservative American labor movement
we're talking about developing added
oats to the poisons of the kept press
commercial media who were demonizing
labor at every opportunity and trying to
undermine our achievements and glow
saying over the crimes of the corporate
rulers who run the society you know
stuff like that
the good book on this one too the firt
is just tells you something about
American academic life the first study
that I've ever heard of you know in the
United States on this major theme of
modern history just appeared university
of illinois press book called selling
free enterprise by a woman named
Elizabeth phones wolf f 0 nes stash wolf
it's kind of a political but like she
doesn't have a right I can see any
special point of view but the material
and it is pretty revealing it's the next
part of the story that I was going to
get to this hazard facing industrialists
you know and the rising political power
of the masses that led to the Mohawk
Valley formula and so on that terrified
the daylights out of the business
community now it was kind of put on hold
during the Second World War but it took
off immediately after the Second World
War at a huge scale instantly you know
and that's what she's talking about
selling free enterprise the idea was as
they put it remember that the United
States came out of the Second World were
pretty social democratic like most of
the world and like just like those
Italian workers who had to have ideas
about worker management beaten I their
head by force an awful lot of people in
the United States to like maybe half
thought that there ought to be popular
control over industry in some fashion
you know this is so exotic in the united
states that the fashion was never
described but somehow that the
government could do a better job than
private power things like that there was
an enormous support for social programs
you know medical programs and so on that
had to be beaten out of people's heads
and fast the leaders of the public
relations industry she quotes a lot on
they said look we have three to five
years to save our our way of life we
have to fight and quickly win what they
call the everlasting battle for the
minds of men and indoctrinate people
with a capitalist story so fully that
they can repeat it you know on every
opportunity and on and on like that and
they weren't kidding around I mean for
example about a third of the material in
American schools elementary schools was
coming straight out of corporate
propaganda offices by the early 50s
sports leagues were taken over the
churches were taken over the
universities were attacked and there was
across the board you know major effort
to try to win the everlasting battle for
the minds of men and it's still going on
you know I mean here it's conscious now
that part of its conscious most of it is
most of the participants it's just you
know it's in your bones I mean you've
gone through the especially if you've
been through in a lead educational
system and you know then it's you're
really deeply indoctrinated in it so I
my on how to measure this is my pet like
personal feeling is that you find more
passivity and obedience in the elite
centers than you do like you know out in
the streets or in the state colleges
well you know Adam Smith once you're
supposed to worship him but not read him
you know what's worth reading he once
remarked somewhere that if you find two
businessmen talking to each other
they're involved in a conspiracy against
the public you know something like that
and yeah there's something to that but
you know it's not as though I mean there
you can read descriptions like what
you're saying incidentally in the
business press so for example in the
Financial Times in London which is like
the main you know the most important
business newspaper in the world a couple
years ago they had an article by the
economics correspondent of the BBC you
know it's all very establishment stuff
in which he said that something like
this that what's evolving is what he
called a de facto world government in a
new imperial age and the de facto world
government is a set of shadowy
institutions under the areas or another
day original what they're doing which
basically served the interests of
transnational capital and financial
institutions and he said for example the
g7 you know the seven big rich countries
meaning just their executives and their
leadership nobody else knows what
they're doing the IMF the World Bank you
know
it's been the GATT council now it'd be
the World Trade Organization and yeah
they get together and they're running in
the fact the world government I think
that's kind of a you know it's kind of a
metaphor I mean like it's not that they
get together somewhere and say okay
here's what we're going to do they do
get together but it's usually extremely
boring like if you were unfortunate
enough to have gone to this Davos
conference the other day I'm sure you
would have been bored out of your mind I
mean I can go and I didn't see the
document but but having read things like
I did I do a lot of reading of this
stuff like the trilateral commission is
one of them and they publish regular
documents so boring I mean after after a
couple of years I stopped subscribing
you know so predictable and boring and
pablum and so on and so forth and
besides you can read it in foreign
affairs or the you know the arcanist
business page where ever you want any
day but yes they do get together and
sometimes when things get scary they
really do things so say take the
trilateral commission the one
publication of theirs which really is
interesting and worth reading this is
the Commissioner was put together by
David Rockefeller around 1973 and it's
one of the ones that people refer to
when they talk about this you know
secret nexus of rulers and so on
although as I say it's mostly a bore but
in 1975 the first publication was very
interesting and I'd urge you to read it
if you haven't done it it's called the
the crisis of democracy and it's very
much in line with the kind of stuff I
was talking about before remember this
is after this is first getting together
after the 60s okay all this ferment went
on in the 60s which you know women and
minorities and all kind of people are
supposed to be kept in their place where
suddenly trying to get into the public
arena and do something about their
interests and that again drove people
crazy just as as did the working class
struggles in the 30s so here you have a
gathering of a leech trilateral means
United States Europe and Japan so these
are elite elements mostly liberal on
liberal side incidentally like if you
look at the composition it's around
roughly speaking around Carter Democrats
packed the whole carter administration
including Carter himself was drawn from
this group that's roughly the complexion
