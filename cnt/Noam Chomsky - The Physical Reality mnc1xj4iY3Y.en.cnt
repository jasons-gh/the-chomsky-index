nevertheless over some period this was
reinterpreted and given the contemporary
naturalistic approach namely aspects of
the world can be studied at various
levels and that whatever property they
have if it's counter to air in common
sense intuition too bad for our
intuition that has no status so if in
fact I can affect the Moon by moving my
arm sounds crazy but that's the way it
turns out okay and if it turns out that
the world is really 10 dimensional with
infinite you know one-dimensional
strings we'll okay that's crazy but if
that's the way it turns out fine
intuitions are relevant for them where
there are many levels at which we can
study this reality whatever it is we're
going to try to integrate them that's
the sensible version of the unification
problem there is no emotion of existence
or reality apart from what figures in
our best explanatory theories in
particular there is no theory at all of
the physical or the material these
concepts at this period therefore we
have no coherent question to ask about
what lies outside the physical there no
longer is a mind-body problem except
just by arbitrary stipulation and the
reason is there's no such thing as body
till somebody tells us what physical
means there's no question about what
lies beyond the physical and physics has
no concept of physical just whatever we
come to understand or maybe more
narrowly whatever we come to understand
in such a way that there's at least a
reasonable prospect of integrating it
with the core Natural Sciences shall
loose idea but there's no concept of
physical or physical reality beyond that
