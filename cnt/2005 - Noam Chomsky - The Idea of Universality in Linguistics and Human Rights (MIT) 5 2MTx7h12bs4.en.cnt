today yes I'm sure you know John
Negroponte II was recently appointed as
the first director of intelligence and
like bolton he too has credentials in
the 1980s during the first reign of the
current incumbents in washington at that
time he was the ambassador to Honduras
where he presided over the world's
largest CIA station it was not because
of Honduras is so significant in world
affairs but it was because he was
supervising the camps in which the u.s.
terror army was trained and armed for
its war against Nicaragua which was no
small matter the country was virtually
destroyed
well if Nicaragua had adopted our norms
it what it would have done is respond by
terror attacks within the United States
in self-defense in this case authentic
self-defense but it didn't instead
Nicaragua pursued the peaceful means
that are required by international law
it brought the u.s. attack to the World
Court nicaragua's case was presented by
a distinguished barbecue niversity
lawyer
professor Abe J's the court bent over
backwards to accommodate Washington it
eliminated a large part of the case that
Jay is presented for an interesting
reason the reason was that when the
United States had accepted World Court
jurisdiction in 1946 it entered a
reservation excluding the United States
from any multilateral treaties notably
the UN Charter which bans the
unauthorized use of force as criminal in
fact the supreme international crime in
the words of the nuremberg tribunal but
of course only when others do it the
court therefore restricted itself to
bilateral u.s. nicaragua treaties and
customary international law but even on
those very
grounds it charged Washington with
technical technical words were unlawful
use of force which in late terms just
means international terrorism ordered
Washington to terminate the crimes and
pay substantial reparations which would
go far beyond overcoming the debts that
are strangling the country that were
accrued during the u.s. terrible war the
Security Council of the United Nations
affirmed the World Court judgement in
two resolutions vetoed by the United
States
hence the unreported and unknown the
u.s. immediately escalated the attack
leaving the country
utterly wrecked with a death toll that
in per-capita equivalent terms for us
would be 2.5 million dead in the United
States that's more than all US deaths in
all wars in its history including Civil
War Nicaragua has so declined that 60%
of children under 2 are suffering from
severe malnutrition probable permanent
brain damage all of this is so deep in
the memory hole in the elite
intellectual culture that scarcely known
we want to see some examples take the
editorials in The Boston Globe in the
last few days which are puzzling about
anti-american attitudes in Nicaragua
after its failed revolution failed for
some reason there are several relevant
conclusions from all of this one is it's
another illustration of Washington's
self exemption from international law
including humanitarian law based on
universal principles of human rights in
this case as many others with very grim
human consequences and it also reveals
again the self exemption of the ailee
intellectual culture from responsibility
for our crimes it's a conclusion
reinforced by the fact that Washington
has just appointed a leading condemned
international terrorists to the position
of world's leading anti-terrorist czar
this is quite normal or will wouldn't
have known whether to laugh or weep in
fact the US has refused to ratify most
of the enabling conventions that were
passed by the General Assembly to
implement the Universal Declaration or
more accurately it's accepted none of
them to my knowledge because the few
cases that have been ratified are
accompanied by reservations that exclude
the United States just like the Genocide
Convention and others that incidentally
includes the anti torture conventions
that have stirred up a lot of recent
debate as an important article in the
matter of the Journal of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences by a
distinguished constitutional law
specialist Sanford Levinson and he
joined most others in condemning the
bush Justice Department including the
recently appointed Attorney General for
having articulated and quoting Levinson
for having articulated a view of
presidential authority that is all too
close to the power that Schmitt was
willing to Accord his own Fuhrer he's
referring to Carl Schmitt who was the
leading philosopher of law during the
Nazi period and whom Levinson describes
as the true eminence grise of the Bush
administration nevertheless Levinson
offers some defense of the Justice
Department authorization of torture he
points out that when the Senate ratified
the UN Convention Against Torture and
other cruel inhuman and degrading
treatment and punishment it quoting
Levinson it offered one what one might
call a more interrogator friendly
definition of torture than that adopted
by the UN negotiators and the unilateral
u.s. definition does go some way towards
permitting
actresses that have recently enraged the
world and elicited much highly critical
commentary here
well it's depressingly easy to continue
but I'll end with one last observation
about the current scene a few days ago I
gave a talk at the Hope Church in
downtown Boston it was a meeting called
by Chris Paz to commemorate the 25th
anniversary of the assassination of
Archbishop Romero of El Salvador a voice
for the voiceless as he was called
murdered by security forces backed by
the United States many of them graduates
of the famous school for the Americas
Romero was assassinated while he was
performing Mass shortly after having
sent President Carter an eloquent letter
pleading with him not to send aid to the
brutal military junta in El Salvador
which will sharpen the repression that
has been unleashed against the peoples
organizations fighting to defend their
most fundamental human rights I was
ignored state terror increased after the
assassination always with us support the
hideous decade just there ended with the
murder of six leading Latin American
intellectuals jazz priests by an elite
US armed and trained battalion that had
already compiled a shocking record of
atrocities mostly the usual victims
peasants working people priests and lay
workers in fact anyone connected even
loosely to the people's organizations
fighting to defend their most
fundamental human rights Christmas was
one of the first of the mostly Church
based organizations that were formed
after the Romero assassination to
support those who are fighting to defend
their most fundamental human rights and
they did it in ways that are really of
historical significance
they broke entirely new paths in many
centuries of Western violence
they did it by going to live with the
victims to help them to in the hope that
a white face might protect them from the
wrath of the us-backed state terrorist
forces that's never happened before I
had the privilege that night sharing the
platform with Mir not paralyzed she just
saw the door in Supreme Court justice
who's the widow of Herbert Anaya and is
attempting to continue his work under
terrible conditions Anaya was the
leading human rights activist in El
Salvador he was imprisoned and tortured
by the u.s. imposed government and then
assassinated by the same hands that
murdered the archbishop and the leading
Jesuit intellectuals along with tens of
thousands of the usual victims and
comparable stories in the neighboring
countries and elsewhere well in a
society that valued its freedom it would
be completely unnecessary to recount any
of this because it would be taught in
schools and it would be well known to
everyone and we would now be preparing
to commemorate the 25th anniversary of
the assassination of the voice for the
voiceless just as we would have
commemorated a few months ago the 15th
anniversary of the assassination of six
leading intellectuals anything like that
it remotely like that had happened in
Eastern Europe in those years we would
certainly know about it
and in fact we would be reacting
reacting the same way right now to the
continuing atrocities by the military
forces armed and trained by Washington
for example in Colombia which has been
the leading human rights violator in the
hemisphere for many years and throughout
all that period has been the leading
recipient of US military aid and
training happens to be a very well
established correlation not
insignificant again it would be well
known to everyone in a free society or
society that valued its freedom last
year Colombia
apparently maintained its record of
killing more labor activists than the
rest of the world combined
a few weeks ago the military broke into
the most important of the towns that had
declared
