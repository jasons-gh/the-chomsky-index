the Snowden stuff a surprise and I mean
by that I surprised it quite how
extraordinary it was or not a surprise
at all I think the scale was at least to
me very surprising it is in fact
phenomenal after there's a new book by
glenn greenwald i know if it's come out
here which surveys a lot of it brings it
together and it's really a colossal
campaign I was very clear that they want
to pick up everything everything that
anyone says who they meet who they see
anything you can think of it's a hundred
percent the goal is a hundred percent
collection of all information about all
of the enemies of the state and what
this reveals pretty dramatically is
something we all ought to know that four
states one of their main enemies is a
domestic population they have to be kept
under control they're dangerous and if
you look at policy decisions it's pretty
consistent that you have to control this
dangerous enemy this isn't this carries
it way beyond anything that's been done
before of course there's been plenty
before I mean I was during the 1960's I
was very much involved in resistance
activities against the war in Vietnam
and we understood that you can't talk on
the telephone and if there's anything
serious something that would involve the
particular human beings let's say a
dessert or something you couldn't even
talk in a group of friends because
there's probably a government informer
there well so everything had to be done
with affinity groups so this is well
understood and goes way back but nothing
like this scale has ever happened and
Britain agrees as you probably saw the
British government requested the NSA to
to provide a detailed extensive
information on cell phones social media
other forms of interaction for British
citizens who are an enemy of this state
in the United States it's it's kind of
dramatic because of the Fourth Amendment
to the Constitution the Fourth Amendment
to the Constitution part of the Bill of
Rights it guarantees the security of
citizens in their persons homes papers
and effects and bars what are called
unreasonable search and seizures as a
reason for that has to do with England
the British rulers demanded before
demanded the right to break into homes
to search them and there were pretty
bitter confrontations right in boston
where i live in fact citizens organizing
to bar the entry of the british officers
under what were called writs of
assistance that they could just enter
wherever they like this was one of the
things that sparked the american
revolution and shortly afterwards when
the Bill of Rights was introduced in the
Constitution they made sure to put a
barrier against any such practices on
the part of the state well now the
practice the Fourth Amendment is being
violated in a way which is so dramatic
that it takes your colleagues in the
legal profession to try to figure out
how to make them consistent
