story I mean one of the more or less
hidden stories of the past generation is
the story of Liberation Theology it's a
just this last November there was a
commemoration of the 20th anniversary of
the fall of the Berlin Wall and great
celebration liberation of Eastern Europe
was nonviolent you know a lot of ODEs to
love and non-violence and so on and yeah
well more or less accurate there was
another event in at the very same time
one week after the fall of the Berlin
Wall a elite Salvadoran battalion which
had just come from training extra
training it armed and trained by the
United States had just come from extra
training at the Fort Bragg Special
Warfare JFK Special Warfare school in
North Carolina they broke into the
University and murdered six leading
Latin American intellectuals Jesuit
priests blew their heads off well that
was kind of like a it was intended to be
a final blow the liberation theology did
quite kill it off that it was a serious
blow now that ended a deck brought to an
end a decade in Central America of
harmful horrifying terrorist atrocities
for which we were responsible in El
Salvador alone maybe seventy thousand
people were killed mostly by the
us-backed armed forces including this
elite battalion which was the u.s.
favored you know the best applicable
battalion our pride and joy killed
thousands of people that's bad enough
but it's more than that
if Liberation Theology what grew out of
an attempt by pope john xxiii
to revive the gospels there's a history
of christianity first three centuries of
Christianity it was a radical passive
religion which is why I was persecuted
it was the religion of the poor on the
suffering Jesus was a symbol of the poor
and suffering that's what the cross was
in the fourth century it was taken over
by the Roman Empire Emperor Constantine
he turned the church into the Church of
the persecutors the persecutors the rich
the powerful the cross wit from being
the symbol of the suffering of the poor
to the shield of the forces of the Roman
Empire and for the rest of its history
that's what the church has pretty much
been it's been the Church of the rich
the persecutors the privilege is the
powerful well Jonathan 23rd tried to
reverse that tried to revive the Church
of the Gospels this is 1962 Vatican 2
the u.s. responded immediately with
extreme violence this was a heresy the
church was taking up the lesson of the
message of the Gospels what's called the
preferential option for the poor can't
allow that you know so a major campaign
began the first major step was the
Kennedy initiated military coup in
Brazil took place right after the
assassination which installed the first
of the kind of neo-nazi style national
security terror and torture states of
the region this is a plague spread
throughout the continent included
penis-shaped and Chile the Argentine
killers and torturers maybe the worst of
all of them Reagan's favorites the
Uruguay all through the continent
reached Central America in the nineteen
in the 1980s then came that decade of
horror and atrocities and finally ended
with the murder of the Jesuit
intellectuals by the u.s. trained elite
battalion that's a pretty significant
event in history it's reversing an
effort to restore Christianity
did anybody commemorate that and
November 2009 no that's that's a hair
crimes before they didn't occur and
wasn't no he does about it well you know
that was liberation theology was a
religious movement was based on the
Gospels if that's not religious I don't
know what is it it was of course what we
would call a radical movement because
the Gospels are radical it was the
preferential option for the poor we're
supposed to be in favor the preferential
option for the rich so sure it was
radical Marxist what or another epithet
that was in fact the message of the
Gospels and it awakened many currents
elsewhere including here also the the
evangelical movements here are not
completely uniformed by any means
there's an element within the
evangelical movements which was very
much influenced by liberation theology
these are the core of the part of the
core of the Solidarity movements that
developed in the 1980s
you know people went down to Central
America lived with poor people partly to
protect them with just a white face from
the us-run murderers and partly just to
help out the many of them still there
it's spread throughout the world it's
part of the core of the International
Solidarity movement you know Christian
peacekeepers and a Barone and so on the
Catholic Bishops here were influenced by
it in fact the National mythic bishops
council took positions so radical that
the press commune reported the radical
by our standards you know like about
Gospels are radical but said well
there's another aspect to the religious
movements a major aspect of the
religious movements just to the past
half century so keep away from cliches
is worlds much more complicated
