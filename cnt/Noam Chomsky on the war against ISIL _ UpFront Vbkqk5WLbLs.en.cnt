he's been ranked with Shakespeare Karl
Marx in the Bible as one of the 10 most
quoted sources in academia
I'll speak to Noam Chomsky about the US
war against ISIL and his very public
spat with the president of Turkey
I'm Manny Hassan also on the show on the
fifth anniversary of the Arab Spring
will debate the current state of Egypt
with a us supporter of President Sisi
and the young activist who is imprisoned
and tortured in Cairo but first he's
been described as arguably the most
important intellectual alive but where
does he stand on US airstrikes against
ISIL or even Russian airstrikes and
what's behind his ongoing war of words
with President Erdogan of Turkey in the
first of an exclusive two-part interview
I went to Boston to sit down with this
week's headliner professor Noam Chomsky
professor Chomsky thank you for joining
me on upfront and you are probably the
world's best known critic of u.s.
foreign policy right now the US
government is involved in a war to try
and degrade and defeat ISIL in Syria and
in Iraq do you support the us-led
bombing campaign of that brutal horrific
group ISIL and if not what do you think
should be done if anything to try and
defeat them or at least reduce the
threat they pose to the region into the
wider world well the first thing we it's
a monstrosity there's no question about
that we know its origins it developed
out of the US invasion of Iraq
you hit a fragile system with a
sledgehammer you caused all kind of
problems one of them one of the many
problems in addition to hundreds of
thousands of people killed millions of
refugees destroying the country was
inciting a sectarian conflict that may
have simmered but barely existed before
and out of this came one monstrosity
after another the latest is ISIL it has
another source the leading US ally in
the region Saudi Arabia which has been
for years funding both funding extremist
jihadi groups and also spreading its
extremist Lobby Salafi version of Islam
through
qur'anic schools mosques radical clerics
and so on and these things have all fed
into Isis so the first thing to do is
understand it and there's extensive
study of what his appeal is and it turns
out it's a disaffected young people
living in conditions of humiliation and
degradation with nothing in their lives
and Muslim don't have much of a
background in Islam some of them in fact
of recent converts but a lot of its peer
pressure and this is offering them some
dignity and hope for their lives you're
saying tackle the underlying causes look
at the bigger picture but I agree with
you and I think a lot of people would
say you're right but in the short term
while you're doing that that's a
long-term operation in the short term
while they're controlling territory and
killing Yazidis and attacking Kurdish
town so how do you stop them well
suppose they're killing your CDs what do
you do you support the people who are
saving the LEDs who happen to be on the
US terrorist list the PKK yes okay
they're the ones who were primarily
responsible for saving the as you DS
okay but if the Americans say we will
drop bombs and they have been working
with various Kurdish groups with some
but do you support yours just wondering
you as a critic do support that support
the working with the Kurds yeah the one
the usf force working with the Kurds to
defeat ISIL to the extent that they are
supporting the the Kurds in Java as they
call it the Kurdish areas of Syria have
defended their territory seem to be
developing as well as you can under
these conditions a fairly decent society
very different than anything else in
Syria
you know they certainly merit support so
you don't object in principle per se as
some on the Left do to any airstrikes by
any western country you're saying if
there's a practical purpose on the day
in in alliance with certain people on
the ground you don't you're not an
absolute pacifist I think there are
times when the use of military forces
defensively is and ISIL is one of them
defending the Kurds against the ISIL
attacks yes that's legitimate the but
you have to look at what's going on
the there's other groups there that are
not very different from ISIL like to the
illness referent who are being supported
by our ally Turkey and our allies Saudi
Arabia and Qatar the Kurds have to
defend it against them too what you have
is a mixture they will claim they're not
supporting these groups they say with
supporting the more moderate Islamist
groups like a hollow shell but they say
but in fact there's no question that
they're supporting the on this referent
that our our I'm not all that different
and Turkey is openly supporting them and
on that one on that debate about
supporting different groups and factions
do you think it's possible to fight the
Assad regime and ISIL in some of these
other groups you mentioned at the same
time or are you one of those people who
thinks the West needs to get behind
Assad in order to defeat ISIL is there a
lesser of two evils there I mean Assad
as monstrous regime however if you
cannot both fight both sides who were
attacking one another you're not it's an
incoherent strategy so you have to
concentrate what you're doing you have
to isolate there there is an answer to
the question of what to do with the
Assad regime it's not bombing Damascus
there's one slim hope slim but the only
one that's the negotiating process
either you say let's not have
negotiations let's all murder each other
or you say let's have negotiations and
see what can come out mentioned Turkey
turkey has recently been hit by several
terrorist attacks on city centers on
tourists
some have been ISIL some have been the
PKK the Kurdish separatist group the
Turkish president mr. Erdogan recently
attacked you by name saying it's time
for so-called intellectuals like you to
quote pick aside you are either on the
side of the Turkish government he said
or you're on the side of the terrorists
you responded by saying other one in
Turkey had been aiding ISIL in the past
you've accused turkey of carry out a
terrorist war against the Kurds he's
undoubtedly carrying out vicious
repressive action
attacking the Kurdish population you can
call it what you like what would you
call it
I'd call it a murder as a matter of
course I'm deeply authoritarian regime
continue reconstituting policies which
in the 90s were totally horrendous I'm
in the 1990s turkey the Turkish
government it was carrying out massive
state terrorism tens of thousands of
people killed thousands of towns and
villages you'd except that he would say
the people he's fighting and carrying
out massive acts of terrorism and murder
I don't you wouldn't deny that I I don't
and Assad says the same thing about the
people he's talking about I don't pay
attention to what leaders of States
either you would accept my PKK has
carried out horrific attacks on
civilians they have carried out attacks
on civilians yes I'm not saying we
should give military aid to the PKK on
the other hand if we are interested in
attacking Isis and saving the other day
and saving the Kurds
we can't say we're going to attack them
that's there they are a lesser of two
evils look I don't know if you want to
rank evils the United States and Britain
are so far higher than anyone else that
we can put all the others to the side
yes there's plenty of Evil's in the
world but we have to deal with the world
as it exists if you want to defend the
Kurds you cannot be attacking the curves
on the subject of others the Turkish
president recently got into a spat with
Vladimir Putin after the shooting down
of a Russian jet in Turkish airspace
some say your critics say you're too
soft on Putin you've said for example
that it might be wrong for Putin's
Russia to back the brutal Syrian
government but it's not imperialism you
said recently why isn't it and our
sections of the Left guilty of only
resisting u.s. imperialism but not
Russian imperialism in the Middle East
in Ukraine and elsewhere sorry
imperialism has a meaning yeah when you
when the United States supports a Saudi
Arabia it's not imperialism even though
it's supporting a brutal and harsh
government when the United States
supports Israel it's not imperialism
even though it's carrying out atrocities
when when Russia supports Damascus it's
not imperious Oh what is Imperial how do
you define it
we can define what it is but it's
extending your power over states and
territories that you're conquering so is
a Hadees in Russia imperialists then
given what is in Crimea is he conquering
the next because he in Crimea is a
totally different issue we can talk
about that if you like but first of all
let's go back to what started with the
Turkish jet that was an extremely
provocative act that JIT according to
Turkey crossed for 17 seconds yes on its
way to continued bombing in Syria where
it was heading and where was shot and
where it fell it was shot down that's an
extremely dangerous act by the Russians
about attack by the Turks using an
American jet that's the kind of thing
that could set off a major war and what
were the consequences the consequences
were as expected that Russia greatly
increased its military forces in the
region put in advanced missiles sent a
missile cruiser yep I mean okay you
don't play games like that what about
the annexing of the actual land of
Crimea started the the annexing of land
in Crimea I think was a criminal act it
but it has a history that imperialists
look impure is it I'm serious use the
definition you get my chair making
London cover I'm sorry I rarely I don't
call it imperialism when the United
States supports the government of Saudi
Arabia Israel Guatemala you said it is
imperialism when you annex land you said
earlier when you ain't allowed it yes
but we have that's true and we have to
look at what happened this it's a
compliment that Crimea has been was
handed over to Ukraine yes I Khrushchev
yes not by the will of Crimea 60 old
years ago in recent years the borders
were guaranteed that there were legal
borders arrests that's why I said it's a
criminal act now what happened in the
background in 1990-91 Soviet Union
collapsed there were two visions of how
to proceed one of them was
Gorbachev's let's have a Eurasian
security system with many with
cooperation and many central points at
Brussels Moscow Ankara and others love
the United States at a different
position let's expand NATO let's expand
a military alliance to the borders of
very fair a lot of the countries in the
region wanted to join is it
democratically it's not a matter of
being fair
suppose that the Mexicans wanted to join
the Warsaw Pact how would the United
States react we know no one is defending
the u.s. actions I'm just looking for
Russian actions so let me just ask about
Putin coming back to Putin's had a
section again do you believe he's only
reacting to NATO
he doesn't have expansionist views of
his own of recreating a strong Soviet
style Russia I'm asked wondering your
opinion very little Evan look he's not a
nice guy I don't want to have dinner
with him but these budding expansionist
know I think all these bodies as various
moves are largely reactive interactive
there are moves on both sides which are
interactive you can't pick one of them
and say that's imperialist
there are interactive moves which are
dangerous there's an answer to this
Ukraine can be neutralized that's the
answer no more talk of NATO enlargement
and no talk of and Ukraine itself is a
pluralist country internally so it can
be neutralized no military alliances and
it can deal with its pluralist internal
structure in that context Crimea should
make its own choice that was part one of
our exclusive interview with professor
Noam Chomsky make sure to watch part two
on next week's upfront when Professor
Chomsky tells me who he'd vote for in
the u.s. presidential election why he
doesn't support a full boycott of Israel
and what the rise of Islamophobia has
led to but now it's time for a reality
check
as the cold war between Saudi and Iran
threatens to turn hot let's take a step
back and ask is this really a war within
the Muslim world where all Muslims have
to pick a side
here's the thing most Muslims aren't
Saudi Arabians or Iranians in fact most
Muslims don't even live in the Middle
East in terms of population and GDP
Indonesia is the world's biggest Muslim
majority country and there are more
Muslims in hindu-majority India than
there are in Iran and Saudi Arabia
combined so it's not surprising that so
many non Saudi non-iranian Muslims
across the globe are so tired of being
dragged into this ongoing spat between
these two bitter Middle East rivals the
Middle East is going through a
transformation that will play out for a
generation rooted in conflicts that date
back millennia not true Barack prior to
the Islamic Revolution in 1979 Saudi
Arabia had good relations with Iran
secular Shah despite Iran being majority
Shia and Saudi being majority Sunni as
recently as 1999 Iranian president
Mohamed Hitomi visited Saudi Arabia to
try and strengthen ties between the two
countries there are no limits to
cooperation with Iran declared the then
Saudi foreign minister the two sworn
enemies even signed a security pact yeah
a security pact with each other two
years later in 2007 the Gulf countries
led by Saudi Arabia invited President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran to attend
their summit where are many to jad even
held hands with King Abdullah of Saudi
Arabia now I'm not saying relations
haven't severely deteriorated in recent
years of course they have linked us
cables suggest the same Abdullah later
urged the Americans to quote cut off the
head of the snake in reference to the
Iranians and in the wake of Saudi
Arabia's beheading of a prominent Shia
cleric on January 2nd Iran's supreme
leader Ayatollah hum and I warned Saudis
rulers there'd be defiant vengeance and
as a former Saudi royal family advisor
told me there should be wait they should
be worried they have the ingredients for
a major confrontation some things are
bad really bad and probably only going
to get worse but remember they haven't
always been bad and they're not bad
because of some 1,400 year old
theological splits oh and most important
of all
their spot doesn't have to shouldn't
have to taint relations between Muslims
across the world the vast majority of
who aren't Iranian and aren't Saudi
it's the fifth anniversary of the Arab
Spring but how much is there to
celebrate in Egypt the country's first
ever elected civilian president Mohamed
Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood was
ousted in a coup following mass protests
and under his successor military General
Abdul Fattah al-sisi there's been a
dramatic deterioration in human rights
according to Amnesty International so
half a decade after the revolution is
Egypt better or worse off than it was
before to debate this issue I'm joined
in the arena from Baton Rouge by dr.
Raymond stock an expert on the Middle
East who spent 20 years living in Cairo
and now teaches Arabic at Louisiana
State University he's praised president
Sisi as egypt's Muslim Churchill and
Mohamed Soltan here in the studio an
Egyptian American who was locked up and
tortured in Egypt for two years as a
political prisoner until he was released
in May 2015 and whose father a senior
Muslim Brotherhood official is still on
death row in Cairo gentlemen thanks for
joining me here in the arena Mohamed
Soltan you're an Egyptian American
citizen who grew up here in the United
States and yet you were arrested by the
Egyptian government for taking part in
anti-government anti-coup protests in
2013 you were held for almost two years
before you were released last year what
happened to you in prison
we were interrogated blindfolded we had
welcoming parties I was beating up on my
broken arm for two straight hours we
were made to strip to our underwear and
and my heads are shaved let me just take
you to months after that where I had to
get my the nails that were placed in my
arm removed surgically removed in an
underground dungeon by an inmate a
doctor with a pair of pliers and
scissors with no anesthesia nothing and
after that I started my hunger strike in
protest of my illegal detention and
where I saw that there was no law there
the the prosecutors told us that tell us
the the country's ours
we can do as we will so seeing that and
seeing that there was no way out from me
into protest that I started a hunger
strike January 26th 2014 and until my
release I in that period I almost died
about 10 times they put me in in a in a
designated d-doesn't an entire building
for me where there was no light I
everything was stripped away from me and
they started passing me razors and
directing me where to cut so that I can
end my misery and theirs they threw a
through somebody in the in the in the
room with me and they let him dying they
left his corpse in the room for 15 hours
until they brought him and then they
came and made me feel guilty about it
they tortured my father they brought him
to the same prison and tortured him
torture by proxy where they were torture
him and let me know what they were doing
to him well let's let me bring in
Raymond stock who's who's listening in
Baton Rouge
um Mohamed Soltan thanks to being
American has managed to get out of there
but the Egyptian government is believed
to be holding more than forty thousand
political prisoners behind bars it's
been slammed by every human rights group
in the world for unlawful detentions
mass killings rampant torture
unprecedented use of the death penalty
you've hailed Sisi as a as a lion I
believe as a Muslim Churchill why is
that given all the human rights abuses
going on on his watch well first of all
I think the human rights abuses are a
much more complicated phenomenon than
just I've said the rise of Assisi Egypt
has been under what essentially
pharaonic style rule for more than 5000
years and has an extraordinarily harsh
and a despotic military government
running things behind the scenes
despite elections despite the rise of
Assisi who I think is not personally at
the same level in a brutality or
harshness or in Azzam as a human being I
don't think he's that sort of person but
I don't think that he controls or is he
taking enough interest in controlling
also these sort of abuses he's focusing
on a struggle against two things one the
Islamists who are a global threat to
impose these same sort of things on
everyone in the world through their
harsh rule and he is also focusing on
and proved
relations between Christians and Muslims
which have really deteriorated under the
Islamists particularly they were already
deteriorating under Mubarak but they had
got much worse under Morsi it's not it's
not a battle between the military and
and I know it's called it's it's the the
January 25th revolution and revolution
you can see that rhetoric in the
Egyptian media you can see that there
are people there are people in the new
Parliament that are clearly against the
January - instruction they are against
everything the ideals and the values of
the print of the genuine solution of
freedom democracy Liberty but just like
let's get back on just give out there is
funnest part what I have seen in prison
from the recruitment efforts the Isis
recruitment efforts inside of prison and
the kind of arguments that are being
made simple arguments first of all the
current environment as I told you is
unprecedented okay that kind of
environment it's already a breeding
ground it should already give us a give
us a sense of moral urgency to act right
I wanted I want to respond to that very
much because I yes thank you I really
think that first of all was in true what
happened to Mohammed and so many other
people is truly deplorable really
disgusting at the same time and there is
in fact in some truth in the argument
that this is radicalizing more people at
the same time a Sisi is working with the
very blunt instruments which is the
state security services that were
trained by Stasi even by the Nazis by
other East European security services
and the Soviets for many many years
under Nasser and in successors these are
inherently brutal people and the methods
that they use are just incredibly bad
and this is a the tragedy the tragic
irony that someone like Assisi rose in
this situation because he's faced with a
violent uprising and it was not a
violent uprising that he began it was he
did not he's not responsible for their
violence March 16 2015 okay we stood
before nagesh mega cata the judge who
sentenced al-jazeera staff and sentenced
me to at a life sentence on that same
day when we return back to Tora prison
an Isis guy got released and
my father my father and 13 others got
the death sentence that should tell you
know what the CC would you I don't want
to see sees a figurehead the entire
regime what it's doing is its fueling
the exact fire that it's attempting to
put out human rights groups are pretty
much in agreement on the human rights
disaster under CC right now but let me
put this to you you wouldn't deny that
under morsi his predecessor that was a
pretty bad situation too there were
pretty a lot of human rights abuses and
abuse of power and the morsi as well
listen I'm not going to sit first of all
there are no comparisons I'm gonna
compare thousands from - it there I'm
not a sit there and argue and Sceptile
compare the figures are there and people
can compare that for themselves but what
what is happening in Egypt is
unprecedented in the last six decades
the vast majority of Egyptians I'm in
touch with and I'm in touch with a broad
spectrum of people support Assisi and
think that things are far better far
more secure for the average Egyptian
they're not so secure for the four
dissenters and that is a tragedy in an
ironic pity but it is not a reason I
think to withdraw our support from the
Sisi the trouble is America for example
many people have talked about
withdrawing RA we did cut off aid
following the overthrow of Morsi at the
behest of 30 million Egyptians we now
have restored the aid more or less but
with the proviso that they can no longer
buy on credit so they have turned to the
Russians of the Chinese the United
States government stood by the Egyptian
people's choice it stood by their
choices stood by the values and
principles that the United States what
makes the United States government the
United States government supports more
see Raymond says Nazis think that
there's only one from your experience
what was your experience know that the
United States government the President
President Obama President Obama stood by
the choice of addition people but then
even afterwards the month I got arrested
secretary Kerry was was talking about
Egypt's on its way to restoring
democracy when me and six other American
American Gyptians were locked up for
protesting for protesting a military
coup do you think Egyptians are better
off today five years on Raymond than
they were before I think that they're
worse off than they were before the
January 25th revolution I think that
they're better off under a CC generally
than it would be under more see if you'd
continued
I think that this however it is bad for
descents bad for the those who long to
see more civil liberties in Egypt that
situation has to be resolved before the
the revolution can be considered
complete Assisi I think is the best hope
for the moments he sees the best hope
for the moment Mohammed five years on
that's not only not and he will be gone
soon he will be gone soon in your view
okay that's all we have time for
gentlemen thanks for joining me in the
arena on this anniversary of a rather
remarkable historic event in the Middle
East that's our show
upfront we'll be back next week
you
