so welcome all NYU students a shout out
to NYU students in Paris and welcome
students from all over the world my name
is Ed rods velovsky freshman at NYU in
pairs today I'm sitting down that MIT
with professor Noam Chomsky a world
renowned scholar political activist and
linguist so I want to start off by
something you said at occupy Boston you
said the most exciting aspect of the
Occupy movement is the construction of
the linkages that are taking place all
over if they can be sustained and
expanded occupy can lead to dedicated
efforts to set society in a more humane
course some have said that the Occupy
movement does not have a cohesive
message of its demands if you do believe
that the Occupy movement has specific
demands how many of these demands do you
actually think can be realized there are
there are quite a range of people from
many walks of life many concerns
involved in the Occupy movement there
are some general things that bring them
together but of course they all have
specific concerns as well the primarily
I think this should be regarded as a
response the first major public response
in fact to about 30 years of a really
quite bitter class war which is not
which has led to a social economic and
political Arrangements in which the
democratic system has been shredded now
you can Congress for example has its
lowest approval rating in history
practically
invisible and other institutions not
much higher population is angry
frustrated bitter and for good reasons
for the past generation policies have
been initiated which have led to
extremely sharp concentration of wealth
in a tiny sector of the population in
fact the wealth distribution is very
heavily weighted by literally a top of
ten one-tenth of one percent of the
population fraction so small they're not
even picked up on the census you have to
statistical analysis to detect them and
they have benefited enormously this is
mostly from the financial sector hedge
fund managers CEOs of financial
corporations and so on the at the same
time the for the majority of the
population incomes have pretty much
stagnated real wages have pretty much
stagnated sometimes decline the benefit
system they were very strong has been
weakened the people have been getting by
in the United States by much higher work
loads so by now us worker works far more
hours than its counterpart in other
industrial countries and by yet debt
which is sooner or later unsustainable
and by the illusions created by bubbles
most recently the housing bubble which
collapsed like bubbles to leaving about
eight hundred trillion dollars in paper
wealth disappearing for some sectors of
the pop
elation african-americans almost all
wealth has disappeared and this has been
a pretty harsh and bitter period not by
the standards of the third world but
this is a rich rich society and people
judge their situation and their
prospects by what ought to be the case
and so at the same time the political
system the concentration of wealth leads
almost reflexively to concentration of
political power which in turn translates
into legislation naturally in the
interests of those implementing it and
that accelerates what has been a vicious
cycle leading to as I said bitterness
anger frustration a very atomized
society that's why the linkage is being
created in the Occupy movement are so
important but this is really the first
sustained response to this they're there
people refer to the Tea Party as a
response but that's highly misleading f1
the Tea Party is relatively affluent
white that it's its power it does have
influence and power but that comes from
the fact that it has an enormous
corporate support and heavy finance and
there are parts of the corporate world
simply see them as their shock troops be
sure that gives them political power but
it's not a movement any serious since
this is and the going back to your
question about the demands there are
general ones which are very widely
shared in the population concerned about
the inequality about the chicanery of
the financial institutions about the way
the there
influence on the government has led to a
situation in which the those responsible
for the crisis are helped out build out
richer and more powerful than ever and
the victims are ignored the there are
very specific proposals of concerning
regulation of fascial transaction taxes
changes in the rules of reversal of the
rules of corporate governance that have
led to this kind of situation a shifting
of the tax code back to what it
something more like what it used to be
with the wind the very rich were not
essentially exempted from taxes and many
other quite specific demands of that gun
it goes on to the interests of groups in
their particular concerns which is some
which are quite far reaching but a
primer but I think when you view if you
investigate the Occupy movement and you
ask what are your demands they are
reticent and rightly so because they're
they're essentially crafting a point of
view for many disparate sources and one
of the striking features of the
movements has been simply the creation
of cooperative communities to something
very much lacking in an atomized
disintegrated society that includes
general assemblies which carry out
extensive discussion kitchens libraries
support systems and so on so all of
that's kind of a work in progress
leading to community structures which if
they can spread out into the broader
community and to retain their bite
but it could be very important Colin
Asher a journalist wrote a piece for the
progressive he wrote most I'm he wrote
most scribes have settled on the idea
that occupy wall street is like Tahrir
Square in Egypt but I disagree occupy
wall streeters more like a Hooverville
the space itself engages people's
imaginations but nothing will be settled
here not even the meaning of what is
happening and the participants won't be
able to define it it matters that
something is happening in lower
Manhattan and that people are paying
intention but it doesn't matter but it
doesn't much matter what is happening
and you have said once the 2012 election
is now expected to cost two billion
dollars it's going to have it's going to
have to be mostly corporate funding so
it's not at all surprising that Obama
selecting business leaders for top
positions the public is quite angry and
frustrated but unless western
populations can rise to the level of
Egyptians they're going to remain
victims so what I'm wondering is do you
see the Occupy movement as an anarchist
movement the kind of uprising that you
have been advocating for much of your
career is it a precursor to a revolution
or can these goals be achieved without a
revolution first of all let's talk about
Egypt the what happened in tougher
square and so on was extremely important
historic importance in fact and it did
achieve a goal namely eliminating the
dictatorship but it left the regime in
power so yes that's an important goal
and go there have been achievements the
press as much freer the labor activism
is much less constrained and in fact one
striking difference between the Egyptian
and Tunisian uprisings and the Occupy
movements is that in the North African
case the labor movement was right at
Center Road and in fact there's a very
close correlation between such successes
as there have been in the Middle East
North Africa correlation to that and the
level of labor militancy over many years
that's been true in Egypt for years
usually crushed but some successes and
as soon as the labor movement became
integrated into the April sixth movement
I've heard square movement it became a
really significant powerful force that's
quite different here at the labor
movement has been decimated and part of
the task to be carried out as to
revitalize it but going back to in
Tunisia they did succeed in having an
getting rid of a dictator and running a
parliamentary election with a moderate
Islamist party in control in Egypt as I
said the word gains but the military run
regime is very much in power there will
be a parliamentary election and the has
been already and again that's the groups
that are succeeding in the elect
election are those that have been
working for years or organizing among
the general population the Muslim
Brotherhood and the cell office is quite
a different situation here there hasn't
been that kind of large-scale organizing
there hasn't been a the labor movement
has been struggling to retain victories
that have won a long time ago and that
are but it has been losing the however I
don't excite I don't think anyone
seriously talking about a revolution
to have a revolution you have to have a
meaningful one you need a substantial
majority of the population coming to the
conclusion alfredo and there's nothing
like that here here I mean remotely so
should we be trying to achieve that
pardon should I'm should we try to
achieve that should we be working up to
a revolution where can we achieve it
some kind of a different way first of
all we're nowhere near the limits of
what reformed in carry out and in that
people can have the idea of revolution
the back of their mind if they want but
there are very substantive actions that
should be taken place I don't exactly
know what it means to sit to say is this
just an artist I mean anarchist
movements are very concerned with
specific goals achieving specific goals
that's what they've traditionally been
that's what they should be and in this
case so as I said there are very
specific short-term goals that have
large support fiscal policy controlling
financial institutions dealing with
environmental problems which are
extraordinarily significant all of these
are a very direct immediate concerns a
richer changing the shifting the
political systems of the elections
aren't simply bought and so on all of
this is going on like for example just a
couple days ago New York City City
Council probably under the influence of
the Occupy movements passed resolutions
I think unanimously in fact against
corporate personhood well that's pretty
far-reaching if that it's very popular
idea in the country and if it's pursued
it will dismantle a century of
not legislation but judicial decisions
that have given corporations state
created fictitious legal entities given
them extraordinary rights and power
population doesn't like it and is right
not to like it and this such steps are
already being taken in words and could
lead to to action in the longer term
there are many things that can be done
for example in parts of the country
particularly in Ohio there's quite a
significant spread of work around the
enterprise's a lot of this derived from
a major effort snow 1980s of 30 years
ago 1977 I think to try to when US Steel
was closing one of the clothes sell off
and close one of the major installations
and the workforce and the community
offered to buy it and run it themselves
dustrial democracy essentially that went
to the courts and they lost in the
courts although with sufficient support
the code of one and but even the failure
like many failures have spawned other
efforts and by now there is a network of
a worker community ond enterprises
spreading over the region that's is that
reformer revolution well if that extends
its revolution it changes the structure
of the institutional structure of the
society actually a lot of its supported
by conservatives it's specified break-up
very simply very sharply on what's
called mostly meaninglessly a right-left
spectrum but these are things that
respond to people's needs and concerns
there have been cases right near here
where similar options were possible and
I think those are directions that should
definitely be pursued a lot of these
things are invader
by things like the Occupy movement and
similarly in going back to Egypt where
the situation is quite different they
have very immediate concerns like the
question of whether the what will the
power of the military regime be will it
be replaced by Islamist forces based on
in the slums and rural areas will the
secular liberal elements be able to have
a what place will they find in this
system the ones who actually initiated
the tire square demonstrations these are
all very concrete problems that they
have to suit deal with here there are
different concrete problems to deal with
there are many similarities in both
cases in Egypt and the United States and
in fact much of the rest of the world
what's happening is a reaction in my
opinion a much to delayed reaction to
the roughly neoliberal policies of the
past 30 years they've been implemented
in different ways in different countries
but it's generally the case that to the
extent that they've been implemented
everywhere they have been harmful to the
general population and beneficial to a
very small sector and that's not
accidental there's a new study by the
economics politiken Amin Policy
Institute which is sort of a major the
that provides the major databases and
analysis for the health of the economy
standard sources they have a new small
book called failure by design and the
phrase by design is accurate these
things don't happen by laws of nature or
by principles of economics to the extent
exist their choices and their choices
made by wealthy in
powerful elements to create a society
that answers to their needs and it's
happened happening in Europe right now
take the european central bank ECB there
are many economists nobel laureates and
others and i agree with them who think
that the policies that the ECB is
following pursuing us basically
austerity and in a period of recession
is guaranteed to make the situation
worse and in so far i think that's been
the case when you under my in a period
of recession what is needed is growth
not austerity and the europe has the
resources to stimulate growth but
they're not being used because of
policies of the central bank and others
and the one can ask what the purpose of
this is an irrational way to judge
purposes is to look at consequences and
one consequence is that these policies
undermine these social democratic
structures the welfare state structures
that have been developed undermine the
power of labor create a more any gal
itary in society with greater power in
the hands of the corporate sector and
the wealthy that's so it's class war
basically and that's a kind of failure
by design as well i think a lot of
people today when you mentioned to them
in anarchist society they get the wrong
impression i think they automatically
may think chaos and and so i kind of
want to ask a question about that do you
so would you describe an anarchist
society as an ultra radical version of
democracy first of all nobody owns
denner gizem anarchism has a very broad
back you could fight all kinds of things
in the anarchist movements so the
question is what would matter to society
be is almost meeting different people
who associate themselves with rough
anarchist tendencies a very different
consumptions but for the most developed
notions among anarchist activists and
thinkers have had in mind a highly
organized society highly structured
highly organized but organized on the
basis of free voluntary participation so
for example can what I mentioned about
the Ohio network of worker community ond
enterprises it's a traditional anarchist
vision enterprises not a owned but
managed which is a big big step beyond
managed by participants so yes very
highly democratic in the free
association with one another could be at
the federal level could be the
international level so it's as a
conception of a structured organized
society with power at the base doesn't
mean it doesn't have representatives can
have but they should be recallable and
under under the influence of the gun
control of participants who's in favor
of society like that well you could say
Adam Smith for example who believed you
can question whether his beliefs were
accurate but believed that market
systems and the invisible hand of
individual choices would lead to
egalitarian societies of common
participation
you can question the logic of the
argument but the goals are
understandable and they go far back they
you can find them in the first serious
book of politics that was ever written
Aristotle's politics over he or didn't
he when he evaluated various kinds of
systems he felt that democracy was the
least bad of them but he said democracy
wouldn't work unless you unless you
could set things up so that it would be
relatively egalitarian and he proposed
specific measures for Athens which in
our terms would be welfare state
measures well so that's a there are
plenty of roots for these concepts
alongs come right out of the
Enlightenment but I don't think this
anyone has the authority to see this is
what matter cos society is going to look
like these are for one thing I mean
there are people who think you can
sketch it out and bring detail but my
own feeling here I essentially agree
with Marx is that these things have to
be worked out by people living and
functioning and freedom who work out for
themselves what kind of societies and
communities are appropriate for them
your secretary said the time is almost
up I think but could I please ask you
just one more question um the late
British philosopher Martin Hollis worked
extensively in questions of human action
the velocity Martin Hollis he worked
extensively in questions of human action
the philosophy of social science and
rationality while you may or may not be
familiar with his work one of the claims
he made was that any an artist vision of
a society rests upon an idea of human
nature that is too optimistic in short
he argued that anarchism is only viable
if humans by nature are good but he says
history shows us that humans cannot be
trusted to this degree thus anarchism is
too idealistic would you mind responding
to this objection very quickly given
your commitment to some of the ideals of
anarchism it's possible to respond to
arguments
is not possible to respond to opinions
if someone makes an assertion saying
here's what I believe fine you can say
what he believes but you can't respond
to it you can say well you can ask
what's the basis for your belief or can
you provide me some evidence what do you
know about human nature actually we
don't know very much about human nature
so yes that's an expression of his
belief he's entitled to make it we have
no idea nor does he have any idea
whether it's true or false but it really
doesn't matter whatever the truth turns
out to be we will follow the same
policies namely try to optimize and
maximize freedom justice participation
democracy those are goals which will
attempt to realize maybe human beings
are such that there's a limit to how far
they can be wrong okay we still follow
the same policies so whatever one's
unarguable effect on the policy and
choices well I professor Chomsky thank
you very much for the interview
