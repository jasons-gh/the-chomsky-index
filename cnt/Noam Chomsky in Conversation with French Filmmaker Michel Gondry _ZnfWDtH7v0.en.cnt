so first of all Michelle I want to thank
you I I just think this is really truly
a remarkable film and and it's a real
gift I think in a way a work of art
really can genuinely be a gift and I
also think you've done a remarkable
thing in that I'm no know I'm around 26
or 27 years I was able to get him to a
film once in that entire twenty-seven
year period
you've now managed to get him to see
this film twice and in in less than a
year so I think that's also a remarkable
gift to know him into the world to drag
him away from the computer for a few
hours and get him out and and to bring
him here with us so I want to thank you
for that as well
I wonder if you could start by talking
this process started 2005 and you know
what the germ of it was for you and then
what a bit of what the journey was to
being here today well I met with no
actually yes 2005 because I was visiting
MIT as a latticed in residence that was
organized by Michele Shima who is here I
realized that now I'm most I guess stick
teaching there at the time and I I was
visiting a lot of student and teacher to
to see all the programs and because
there is this work that's been done
there are that really bridging between
art and science which is a territory
that I always was interested by so I met
with no AMA and after a few session I
proposed - no I'm - doing an in series
of interviews
use abstract animation to illustrate
them although I don't know if you
remember I should you little clip that I
done and it was a set important you said
yes immediately I was always very of
course impressed by your work
and as well because the what was really
attracting me is your scientific work
it's always great to see to be able to
capture the image of the voice of
somebody alive with who has already such
a huge legacy because I watch I was
talking about which a fine man and also
this great scientist who are not here
anymore and I wish I had known them and
I thought it would it was important for
me to try to establish it so no I wonder
if I could ask you a bit about this
intersection the Michelle is raising
about connections between art and
science
you know one fascinating things about
this film as we see Michelle's process
as an artist as he's trying to engage
with your ideas and and his
misunderstandings and and other currents
of thinking I wonder if you could talk
about your own practice of doing science
what does it actually look like for you
what is your process you know when
you're tackling a scientific question
when you're coming up against an aporia
in your work it was like what michelle
captured so with such remarkable
artistry in the film it's usually a
matter of going for a walk thinking
about things talking to somebody hoping
that somehow a what looks paradoxical or
impossible will somehow fall into place
how it happens I don't think anyone
knows it's I'm sure it's the same when
you're
anyone's at creating an artistic work
just somehow comes what what would be a
problem like right now that you would
say you're dealing with in your work or
in a particular aporia currently
currently yeah well the point that
Michelle emphasized correctly is and at
least have been a driving force to me
not for everyone in the field is to try
to show what ought to be true try to
demonstrate what ought to be true it
ought to be true for various reasons
some of which indicated in the film that
the basic essential nature of language
is first of all uniform for all
languages which is why children can
learn any of them and is also
fundamentally very simple when you look
at the data of language it looks
extremely complex but that's true of
anything you don't understand if there's
anything you don't understand that looks
hopelessly complex the idea is to try to
see if you can extricate from the
complexity fundamental principles which
somehow make things fall into place
which otherwise didn't make any sense
like the one principle that was
mentioned at the end of the film about a
seeking minimal structural distance you
can pursue that much farther and a lot
of things fall into place including the
way in which quite complex sentences are
interpreted if you continue to pursue
the idea that there's just has to be
fundamentally simple processes that
interplay in a way which yields observed
complexities so that's the basic work
that I'm involved in just that one paper
coming out a lot of technical questions
about this Michelle I think there's a
very interesting theme that runs
throughout the film and I wonder if it
doesn't also speak to your other film
as I read them I feel like there's a
fundamental curiosity that drives your
work and what Nome refers to as a
puzzlement
looking at things that might appear to
be obvious but being puzzled by them I
wonder if that is something that you
think of in your own practice and if it
might apply not just this film but your
earlier work as well yeah sure I mean I
always like any kid ask many questions
to my parents they always ask why
at some point they get tired of it and
you have to figure out some some of
yourself so there is some scene that I
remember
figuring out by just my questioning my
own questioning and and sometimes I
would verify the answer but I always
have this curiosity to understand what
was going on with the world and when I
was a kid I cattle racism didn't work we
went to some cult and have some my
mother took me to some meeting that we
are really weird
they didn't satisfy me and I found in
science some some more a constructive
answer that they the idea that you can
build something on the ground that
people agreed upon it's and it's one of
the thing that attracted to norms work
philosophy it's this idea that you are
like French philosopher today I would
say or everything is up in the air and
it's foggy and it's it's very abstract
and I think it's important that you can
I try to agree on the ground so you can
build so in my movies I mean it's not
necessarily appearance but I always had
this community and could you actually
access both view about this the
difference between kind of the process
of self education
and your formal schooling because it
seems like both of you have engaged in a
process of learning outside of or it
went beyond the period of formal
education and you know in your case
maybe you could start Michelle talking
about art school and your experiences in
art school and the limitations of a
formal schooling in your own experience
yes I went through at school pretty
early like high school was at school so
I didn't develop academic very very much
I was intrigued and interested into
geometry and I was pretty good at it and
perspectiva I remember being good at
that but I never maybe I saw that art
and that's why I use this abstraction in
animation I could translate complexity
without to go through all those books
right and I I mean I read a bit and I
still reading but of course it's I don't
feel very happy to enormous labor but I
that's why I use abstraction here
because I think I'm not trying to
demonstrate no I'm findings I'm trying
to convey my feelings and I think it's
more I create this way I mean only at
the end I really I mean actually all the
time at the end I really did the work
and I'm sort of proud of like to
sometimes and really to keep donphan
from your graphic it was difficult but I
really wanted to really understand it
the difference between structural and
the linear length of the position of the
world of the verb so I'm I'm not sure I
remember the question now
it's fine it took us to an interesting
place for show what about you know could
you talk about I mean obviously you grew
up in a family of educators and and you
did go through a formal process of
education but you've continued your
education in very profound ways and
outside of some of those formal
boundaries as well I don't want to be
corrupting the youth no no we want to be
much more there to tell the truth with
television the truth is I have
absolutely no professional credentials I
literally which is why I'm teaching at
MIT they didn't look that's absolutely
true they didn't care no it's a
science-based University they didn't
care if you had a guild card something
or other so when he saw a little of it
there but I hated high school that was
in it was the academic high school in
the city the one that all the kids went
to who were gonna go to college teachers
didn't really have to work very hard
because we were gonna pass the exams
anyway and I couldn't stand it this is
1945 there were no questions about going
to some college somewhere else you lived
at home you worked you went to the local
college period local college happened to
be the University of Pennsylvania I as a
high school student looked at the look
through the catalog looked really
exciting all these great courses in all
sorts of different fields I was really
looking forward to getting out and going
to college after my first year of
college each course I took in every
field was so boring but I didn't even go
to the classes I'm in the way I was I
was quite interested in chemistry but
the way I passed the chemistry course
was because I had a friend young woman
about my age who took extremely
meticulous notes and red and blue and
and she lent me her notes so I didn't
have to go to class and make it past the
exams you had to go to there was a lab
and I knew you know if I try to carry
out a lab experiment it's not going to
work but there was a lab manual and it
was obvious what the answers had to be
so I just filled in the answers and I
never even went to the lab and then I
had my comeuppance when I had to apply
the next semester because I was charged
$17 which was a lot of money in those
days for lab breakage and I couldn't
tell them look I never went to the lemon
but it sort of went on like that I never
really had an undergraduate degree but I
thought it was I was I started mainly
taking a scattering of graduate courses
without much background in them I then
was lucky enough to get for your
fellowship graduate fellowship just did
my own work and essentially never had I
never had much of a formal education it
was one of the greatest education
educational experiences I ever had in
those four years it was a Harvard it was
to have a desk in the stacks and those
days the stacks were open not anymore a
graduate student had a little desk in
the stacks and you had the whole of
Widener Library this amazing library
there you can kind of walk around and
pick things out from all kind of place
things you never heard of and pursue
them that was fantastic experience I
think it's a great way to get an
education and then I was again very
lucky I got to MIT which is a research
institution they didn't care what didn't
care about credentials you could work on
what you wanted to turned out very well
but
it's just a series of accidents I think
very few people are lucky enough to have
an experience like then so I'm not
suggesting that you know to go to
college and do your work and get your
degree at the beginning of the film
Michelle you you mentioned manufacturing
consent a film about know'm that came
out in 1992 and I just want to
acknowledge people some people in this
room work very closely with Peter when
tonic a great Canadian filmmaker who who
made that film with Mark Akbar and who
passed away this Monday you know real
loss for the documentary community I
know him I wonder if you could talk a
little bit about working with Peter and
and and in that film from from which
must have started in the 1980s really
and then came out in 1992 well actually
I can't really claim to have worked with
I spent a lot of time with him and
enjoyed talking to him very imaginative
thoughtful dedicated person who spent
really spent his life Noorie then but
for many years afterwards doing a very
admirable work of all kinds often turned
out in documentary films but on serious
issues which were hard to investigate he
was did a lot of courageous imaginative
work as far as that film is concerned I
had about as much to do with it as the
moon has if people take photographs of
the moon you know I I was giving talks
and giving interviews and Peter and Mark
Akbar was no what you call and
technically producers was they'd come
around and film and we have some
interviews and they put it together and
I have to admit I never saw it I can't
stand watching myself so I never saw the
film but I'm told it was a pretty
impressive film they did a very good job
I know one thing that they did that I
was very pleased about was to
take one issue that I'd been spending a
lot of time working on it was a very
difficult case though there were a small
number of people working on it none of
us ever thought it would get anywhere it
was the case of East Timor which maybe
you know about which was invaded in 1975
by Indonesia with a strong us support it
led almost quickly to virtual genocide I
don't like the term genocide much but
this one came pretty close maybe two
hundred thousand people killed out of a
population of such a seven hundred
thousand all with full us support us
could cut it off in two minutes
England France others also joined in to
try to pick up a bit of the spoils
Indonesia is a rich country lots of
resources a lot of incentive to support
them and there was a very small number
of people that we're trying to work on
and try to bring some attention to it to
see if something could be saved from the
wreckage went on for a long time
Amy Goodman here and was one of the
people in 1991 who she and Alan Aaron
went and were practically beaten to
death in a demonstration they thought
it's a very good work and got some a lot
of important publicity and now finally
in 1999
President Clinton under a lot of
pressure international and domestic
essentially called it off with a phrase
he essentially told the Indonesian
generals game's over
they left that's what it means to be a
powerful state there's a lot to learn
from that but one thing I I was pleased
about in Peters film is that they
emphasized this and did very evocative
and imaginative work about it which I
think probably and informed plenty of
people about it so it maybe saved a lot
of lives Michelle could you talk I know
tomorrow night the film opens at the IFC
Center downtown you'll
they're at 6:10 8:15 after both of those
screenings also on Saturday you talked
about the wider plans and aspirations
for this film
well I focused on know I'm scientific
approach and I know that I dismiss the
political world I'm aware that the goal
is to save lives but I think where
people are too much talking about the
past like sort of get obstruct their
view are what's going on it I really
understand norms work into trying to
basically save life into acknowledging
people of what is going on now so but I
felt I could do a good job into getting
people to know no I'm a thinker maybe
they would especially in my country
where we have very little access to
tenoram because I think deep down it's
because you critique the media and we
have the news I mean the connection with
Nam could be done by the media but since
they have been criticized they they
pretend an inference we have to choose
silence so basically if you pick if you
don't pick one side or they judge you
from what that's what you call in you
talk about with the pretense of you know
there is all these things which I guess
solo about it I don't have exactly the
same sense of freedom of speech as we
have here so I thought that my people in
France maybe would pay more attention to
the political work of nahma
if we I would introduce not introduced
but emphasis
mas and she impersonal aspect so that
was a little bit my gorram on as well I
as I said before I'm very to me
the science is entertains me much more
that than fiction for instance and ok so
it's coming on France how wide is the
release here I know IFC Films was
bringing it out is gonna mean I I Tunes
Netflix how are people gonna be able to
see the film
how can people here help get the word
out about the film oh yes I mean you
want me to advertise well yes I do I do
this is the moment and then we're
actually enough time for I think around
two questions from the audience I wish
was more but no no I'm literally has a
flight to catch very soon so but sorry
me shelf no I it's going out I think in
tents gradually to tend the screens
hopefully it's gonna go bigger I mean I
don't have any sense of how how much it
can reach I never know in advance but
what I'm thinking is I do come maybe to
a contribution and it could last them
and she yes people will learn about it
when he would still going be
going on I remember the first time I
when I should the first half of the film
to you know I'm you said basically at
the end of surely to you'd on my
computer as you seen the field and you
say okay I agree with it basically
you're saying that you agreed with
yourself which is great and to me I mean
I understand what you meant basically it
meant that and I was very happy but it
meant that you and had not distorted but
what you were saying but I'd say then
you added but he's going to take few
more generation for people to accept
that talking about still by genetic
grammar on the the old conception of
the research assumption for instance and
I was telling you
so I need not upset that you won't be
here to witness that you said no I don't
care about that what I care is like
maybe nobody will be here because of the
climate change and all the risk that
saying it's a I really wanted to add
that at the end but I've sang it I think
it's summarized
no one's priorities so there are some
audience mics and I think there's some
people coming around and there's time
for just a couple quick questions maybe
starting right there with a hat
how you doing thank you both for your
work let me say no you went to a duty in
school and you talked about John Dewey
often or at least I see it online I read
about it you in many ways whether you'd
like to own that or not or our
modern-day Dewey as like a leading
social philosopher I I come from
blue-collar background and now I'm a
Columbia student and I often get you
know the argument that you know we can
no we can no longer have these radical
critiques because we're now part of this
co-signing contributing coop co-opted
entity that's you know usurping you know
proper education and indoctrination how
do you reconcile the two being you know
inside the system part of the system but
also trying to change it and not be
co-opted it's always been a first of all
I don't my unfilled impression over 75
years of activism
is that the level of the energy and
dedication and commitment especially on
part of young people today as as high as
anything I can remember outside of maybe
a few very brief Peaks like maybe
1968-69 but it's quite substantial but
you're right that there are very
intensive pressures to try to beat it
back you use the phrases indoctrination
that's actually the phrase that's used
at the liberal end of the spectrum by
those who were deeply concerned about
the activism independence courage great
contributions of young people of the
sixties who really civilize the society
right after that there was a reaction
and across the spectrum at the sort of
liberal and the trilateral commission
that's basically Carter liberals they
staff Carter Administration a very
important book which called for trying
to reduce to introduce what they called
more moderation and democracy less
participation people should become were
passive and obedient than apathetic and
as one Harvard professor there put it
and maybe we can get back to the good
old days when Truman was Babel able to
run the country with the help of a few
Wall Street lawyers and financiers that
would be democracy but one of the things
they emphasized was what they saw the
failure of the institutions I'm quoting
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young schools universities churches
they were not indoctrinating the young
properly so therefore we have to do more
to indoctrinate the young and there's
been quite a since that time there's
been quite a campaign from kindergarten
to universities in many different ways
to try to impose
discipline obedience apathy atomization
keep it we'll separate from one another
all kinds of things you those of you
that age have all been through it but
you can fuss struggle against it and
plenty of people are doing it and
there's a lot that has been done a lot
more can be done and I think there's I
mean that what you mentioned is a
problem but I don't think it's a paradox
you can work live we do live within the
society we can't pretend we live
somewhere else you can live within the
institutions and work hard to change
them okay we have time for one more
question as a woman would be great yes
right there and back beautiful can
someone bring a mic to the woman right
there in the middle thank you
hi um first of all it was really
enjoyable and you guys are such a great
combination I'm a huge fan of both of
you my question was for gnome about
death
so when I think about death or when I
think about um life really because I
don't really think about death I think
that the thing that is alive in me is
not behind my eyes and it's something
that's bigger than anything that I could
ever possibly imagine so when you say
this spark of how did you put it this
spark of consciousness goes if you
wanted to convince me that you know the
way that you see it like from dust to
dust and then nothing happens how would
you explain that is that a question how
would you explain to me where that spark
of consciousness goes that was my 10
year old self I did used to have
nightmares about the idea that when I
die there is a spark of consciousness
which basically creates the world is the
world going to disappear if this spark
of consciousness disappears and how do I
know it won't how do I know there's
anything
there except what unconscious of so if
this spark disappears it's all gone
later when I got older I thought that
this is a rather classical concern and a
lot of thought and the writing and the
agony and so on about it but as you get
older he just realized look that's not
true the world's going to go on your
children will be alive your
grandchildren your friends other
people's children the children of those
are said villagers in Colombia who you
saw there and so on and the world will
go on it'll go on without me but okay
went on for a long time without me a lot
of it goes on without me and that will
continue to happen it's it just seems
like to me at least seems like less and
less of a problem as you get older it
becomes easy easy to understand why this
is really not something to be concerned
about my personal feeling well in that
very cheerful note everyone Tomsky and
the doc NYC for an amazing week of
programming tests cool visual arts that
I have seen all the volunteers here
fundamental principles which somehow
make things fall into place which
otherwise didn't make any sense like the
one principle that was mentioned at the
end of the film about a seeking minimal
structural distance you can pursue that
much farther and a lot of things fall
into place including the way in which
quite complex sentences are interpreted
if you continue to pursue the idea that
there's just has to be fundamentally
simple processes that interplay in a way
which yields observed complexities
that's the basic work that I'm involved
in just that one paper coming out
another one a lot of technical questions
about this Michelle I think there's a
very interesting theme that runs
throughout the film and I wonder if it
doesn't also speak to your other films
as I read them I feel like there's a
fundamental curiosity that drives your
work and what Noam refers to as a
puzzlement
looking at things that might appear to
be obvious but being puzzled by them I
wonder if that is something that you
think of in your own practice and if it
might apply not just to this film but to
your earlier work as well yeah sure I
mean I always like any kid ask many
questions to my parents they always ask
why at some point they get tired of it
and you have to figure out some sum of
yourself so there is some scene that I
remember figuring out by just my
questioning my own questioning and and
sometimes I would verify the answer but
I always have this occur CT to
understand what was going on with the
world and when I was a kid I cattle
racism didn't work we went to some cult
and have some my mother took me to some
meeting that we are really weird
they didn't satisfy me and I found in
science some some more a constructive
answer that the idea that you can build
something on the ground that people
agreed upon it and it's one of the thing
that attracted to norms work philosophy
it's this idea that you are like French
philosopher they I would say or
everything up in the air and it's foggy
and it's it's very abstract and I think
it's
but know that you can I try to agree on
the ground so you can build so in my
movies I mean it's not necessarily
appearance but I always had this
community and could you I'd actually
access both of you about this the
difference between kind of the process
of self education and your formal
schooling because it seems like both of
you have engaged in a process of
learning outside of or it went beyond
the period of formal education and you
know in your case maybe you could start
Michelle talking about art school and
your experiences in art school and the
limitations of a formal schooling in
your own experience yes I went through
at school pretty early like high school
was at school so I didn't develop
academic very very much I was intrigued
and interested into geometry and I was
pretty good at it and perspective and I
remember being good at that but I never
maybe I saw that art and that's why I
use this abstraction in animation I
could translate complexity without to go
through all those books right and I I
mean I read a bit and I still reading
but of course it's I don't feel very
open to enormous labor but I that's why
I use abstraction here because I think
I'm not trying to demonstrate no arms
findings I'm trying to convey my
feelings and I think it's more I create
this way I mean only at the end I really
I mean actually all the time at the end
I really did the work and I'm sort of
proud of like to the sentence and really
to keep down from from your graphic it
was difficult but I really wanted to
really understand it the difference
between the structural and the linear
length of the position of the world of
the varible so I'm not sure I remember
the question now so first of all
Michelle I wanna thank you I I just
think this is really truly a remarkable
film and and it's a real gift
I think in a way a work of art really
can genuinely be a gift and I also think
you've done a remarkable thing in that
I've known ohm around 26 or 27 years I
was able to get him to a film once in
that entire 27 year period
you've now managed to get him to see
this film twice and in in less than a
year so I think that's also a remarkable
gift to know him and to the world to
drag him away from the computer for a
few hours and get him out and and to
bring him here with us so I want to
thank you for that as well I wonder if
you could start by talking this process
started 2005 and you know what the germ
of it was for you and then what a bit of
what the journey was to being here today
well I met with no I'm actually yes 2005
because I was visiting MIT as a math
test in residence that was organized by
Michele Ashima who is here I realized
that now I'm most I guess stick teaching
there at the time on I I was visiting a
lot of student and teacher to to see all
the programs and because there is this
work that's been done there and that
really bridging between art and science
which is a territory that I always was
interested by so I met with no AMA and
after a few session I propose the
- no I'm - doing an INT series of
interviews and use abstract animation to
illustrate them all I don't know if you
remember I should you little clip that I
done and it was that important you said
yes immediately I was always very of
course impressed by your work and as
well because the what was really
attracting me is your scientific work
it's always great to see to be able to
capture the image of the voice of
somebody alive which who has already
such a huge legacy because I watch I was
talking about which a fine man and also
this great scientist who are not here
anymore and I wish I had known them and
I thought it would it was important for
me to try to establish it so no I wonder
if I could ask you a bit about this
intersection the Michelle is raising
about connections between art and
science
you know one fascinating things about
this film as we see Michelle's process
as an artist as he's trying to engage
with your ideas and and his
misunderstandings and and in other
currents of thinking I wonder if you
could talk about your own practice of
doing science what does it actually look
like for you what is your process you
know when you're tackling a scientific
question when you're coming up against
an aporia in your work it was like what
Michel captured so with such remarkable
artistry in the film that's usually a
matter of going for a walk thinking
about things talking to somebody hoping
that somehow a what looks paradoxical or
impossible will somehow fall into place
how it happens
don't think anyone knows its I'm sure
it's the same when you're anyone's at
creating an artistic work just somehow
comes what what would be a problem like
right now that you would say you're
dealing with in your work or in a
particular aporia currently currently
yeah well the point that Michelle
emphasized correctly is and at least has
been a driving force to me not for
everyone in the field is to try to show
what ought to be true try to demonstrate
what ought to be true it ought to be
true for various reasons some of which
indicated in the film that the basic
essential nature of language is first of
all uniform for all languages which is
why children can learn any of them and
is also fundamentally very simple when
you look at the data of language it
looks extremely complex but that's true
of anything you don't understand if
there's anything you don't understand
that looks hopelessly complex the idea
is to try to see if you can extricate
from the complex and documentary films
but on serious issues which were hard to
investigate he was did a lot of
courageous imaginative work as far as
that film is concerned I had about as
much to do with it as the moon has if
people take photographs of the moon you
know I I was giving talks and giving
interviews Peter and Mark Akbar was no
much call and technically producers was
they come around and film we have some
interviews and they put it together and
I have to admit I never saw it I can't
stand watching myself so I never saw the
film but I'm told it was pretty
impressive filming they did a very good
job I know one thing that they did that
I was very pleased about was to take one
issue that I'd been spending a lot of
time working on it was a very difficult
case though there were a small number of
people working on it none of us ever
thought I would get
anywhere it was the case of East Timor
which maybe you know about which was
invaded in 1975 by Indonesia with a
strong us support it led almost quickly
to virtual genocide I don't like the
term genocide much but this one came
pretty close maybe 200,000 people killed
out of a population of such a 700,000
all with full us support us but cut it
off in two minutes England France others
also joined in to try to pick up a bit
of the spoils Indonesia is a rich
country lots of resources a lot of
incentive to support them and there was
a very small number of people that we're
trying to work on and try to bring some
attention to it see if something could
be saved from the wreckage went on for a
long time
Amy Goodman here and was one of the
people in 1991 who she and Alan there
and went and we're practically beaten to
death in a demonstration they thought
it's a very good work and got some a lot
of important publicity and now finally
in 1999
President Clinton under a lot of
pressure international and domestic
essentially called it off with a phrase
he essentially told the Indonesian
generals games over
they left that's what it means to be a
powerful state there's a lot to learn
from that but one thing I I was pleased
about in Peters film is that they
emphasized this and that very evocative
and imaginative work about it which I
think probably an informed plenty of
people about it so it maybe saved a lot
of lives Michelle could you talk I know
tomorrow night the film opens at the IFC
Center downtown you'll be there at 6:10
8:15 after both of those screenings also
on Saturday you talk about the wider
plans and aspirations for this film well
I focused on no arms
scientific approach and I know that I
dismiss the political world I'm aware
that the goal is to save lives I think
where people are too much talking about
the past like sort of get obstruct their
view are what's going on it I really
understand norms work into trying to
basically save life into acknowledging
people of what is going on now so but I
felt I could do a good job into getting
people to know no I'm a thinker maybe
they would especially in my country
where we have very little access to to
norm because I think deep down it's
because you critique the media and we
have the news I mean the connection with
none could be done by the media but
since they have been criticized they
they pretend and in France we have to
choose silence so basically yeah if you
pick if you don't pick one side or they
judge you
from what that's what you call in you
talk about with the pretense of you know
there is all these things with gas so
low but it's they don't have exactly the
same sense of freedom of speech as we
have here so I thought that my people in
France maybe would pay more attention to
the political work of nahma
if we I would introduce not introduced
but emphasis and the more scientific and
personal aspect so that was a little bit
my gorram
on as well I as I said before I'm very
to me
the science is on two things me much
more that than fiction for instance and
okay so it's coming on France how wide
is the release here I know IFC Films was
bringing it out it's gonna be I I Tunes
Netflix how are people gonna be able to
see the film
how can people here help get the word
out about the film oh yes I mean you
will meet you advertised well yes I do I
do and then we're actually enough time
for I think around two questions from
the audience I wish was more but no no
I'm literally has a flight to catch very
soon so
but sorry Michelle no I it's going out I
think in tents gradually to ten the
screens hopefully is gonna go girl I
mean I don't have any sense of how how
much it can reach I never know in
advance but what I'm thinking is I do
come maybe to a contribution and it
could last on and she yes people will
learn about it well he would
still going be going on I remember the
first time I when I should the first
half of the film to you know I'm you
said basically at the end of surely to
you'd on my computer as you see in the
film you say okay I agree with it
basically you're saying that you agreed
with yourself
which is great and to me I mean I
understand what you meant
basically it meant that and I was very
happy but it meant that you I'd had not
distorted but what you were saying but
I'd say then you added but he's going to
take a few more generation for people to
accept that talking about still by
genetic grammar on the the old
conception of the recent assumption for
instance and I was telling you so I'm
not upset that you won't be here to
witness that
said no I don't care about that what I
care is like maybe nobody will be here
because of the climate change and all
the risk that saying it's a I really
wanted to add that at the end but that's
at thank you I think it's summarized
no one's priorities so there are some
audience mics and I think there's some
people coming around and there's time
for just a couple quick questions maybe
starting right there with a hat how you
doing thank you both for your work let
me say no you went to a duty in school
and you talked about John Dewey often or
at least I that I see it online I read
about it you in many ways whether you'd
like to own that or not our modern-day
Dewey as like a leading social
philosopher I I come from blue-collar
background and now I'm a Columbia
student and I often get you know the
argument that you know we can no we can
no longer have these radical critiques
because we're now part of this
co-signing contributing coop co-opted
entity that's you know usurping you know
proper education and indoctrination how
do you reconcile the two being you know
inside the system part of the system but
also trying to change it and not be
co-opted it's always been a first of all
I don't my unfilled impression over 75
years of activism is that the level of
the energy and dedication and commitment
especially on part of young people today
as as high as anything I can
member outside of maybe a few very brief
Peaks like maybe in 1968-69
but it's quite substantial but you're
right that there are very intensive
pressures to try to beat it back you
used the phrase as a indoctrination
that's actually the phrase that's used
at the liberal end of the spectrum by
those who were deeply concerned about
the activism independence courage great
contributions of young people of the 60s
who really civilize the society right
after that there was a reaction and
across the spectrum at the sort of
liberal and the trilateral commission
that's basically Carter liberals they
staff Carter Administration have very
important it's funny it took us to an
interesting place Michelle what about
you know could you talk about I mean
obviously you grew up in a family of
educators and and you did go through a
formal process of education but you've
continued your education in very
profound ways and outside of some of
those formal boundaries as well I don't
want to be corrupting the youth no no we
want to be much there to tell the truth
with television the truth is I have
absolutely no professional credentials I
literally which is why I'm teaching at
MIT they didn't look that's absolutely
true they didn't care it's a
science-based University they didn't
care if you had a guild card something
or other so we saw a little of it there
but I hated high school it was in it was
the academic high school in the city the
one that all the kids went to who were
gonna go to college teachers didn't
really have to work very hard because we
were gonna pass the exams anyway and I
couldn't stand it
this is 1945 there were no questions
about going to some college somewhere
else you lived at home you worked you
went to the local college period local
college happened to be the University of
Pennsylvania
I as a high school student looked at the
look through the catalogue look really
exciting all these great courses and all
sorts of different fields I was really
looking forward to getting out and going
to college after my first year of
college each course I took in every
field was so boring but I didn't even go
to the classes I'm in the way I was I
was quite interested in chemistry but
the way I passed the chemistry course
was because I had a friend young woman
about my age who took extremely
meticulous notes and red and blue and so
on and she lent me her notes so I didn't
have to go to class and make it past the
exams you had to go to there was a lab
and I knew you know if I try to carry
out a lab experiment it's not going to
work
but there was a lab manual and it was
obvious what the answers had to be so I
just filled in the answers and I never
even went to the lab and then I had my
come up and so when I had to apply the
next semester because I was charged 17
dollars which was a lot of money in
those days for lab breakage and I
couldn't tell them look I never went to
the lab but it sort of went on like that
I never really had an undergraduate
degree by the time I was I was I started
mainly taking the scattering of graduate
courses without much background in them
I then was lucky enough to get a
four-year fellowship graduate fellowship
just did my own work and essentially
never had I never had much of a formal
education it was one of the greatest
education educational experiences I ever
had in those four years it was at
Harvard was to have a desk in the stacks
and those days the stacks were open not
anymore
a graduate student had a little desk in
the stacks and you had the whole of
Widener Library this amazing library
there you can kind of walk around and
pick things out
what kind of place things you never
heard of and pursue them that was
fantastic experience I think it's a
great way to get an education and then I
was again very lucky I got to MIT which
is a research institution they didn't
care what didn't care about credentials
you could work on what you wanted to and
turned out very well
but it's just a series of accidents I
think very few people are lucky enough
to have an experience like then so I'm
not suggesting that you know to go to
college and do your work and get your
degree at the beginning of the film
Michelle you
you mentioned manufacturing consent a
film about know'm that came out in 1992
and I just want to acknowledge people
some people in this room work very
closely with Peter when Tonique a great
Canadian filmmaker who made that film
with Mark Akbar and who passed away this
Monday you know a real loss for the
documentary community I know my wonder
if you could talk a little bit about
working with Peter and and and in that
film from from which must have started
in the 1980s really and then came out in
1992 well actually I can't really claim
to have worked with I spent a lot of
time with him and enjoyed talking to him
very imaginative thoughtful dedicated
person who spent really spent his life
not only then but for many years
afterwards doing a very admirable work
of all kinds often turned out
