there's a nuclear war which has come
very close many times sometimes by
accident or accident it could give some
examples which are harrowing but
sometimes by reckless actions the threat
is now increasing some of the leading
mainstream specialists nuclear
strategist people like William Perry
former defense secretary argue that the
threat of nuclear war today is greater
than it was during the Cold War ok today
and others agree the there's a journal
called The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists it's the major Journal of
Atomic Scientists it opened right at the
beginning of the nuclear age in 1947 two
years after the atomic bombing they
established what they call a Doomsday
Clock a clock with a minute hand and the
question is how far is the minute hand
from midnight midnight means termination
we're done every year they collect a
group of specialists experts to try to
set the minute-hand two years ago they
moved it to minutes closer to midnight
now three minutes to midnight which is
very close to the closest it's been
since the early 1980s when there was a
major war scare we almost came to war so
it's not just William Perry plenty of
others incidentally when they moved it
to midnight they it was not just because
of the threat of a nuclear war it was
also because of the failure of
governments to deal with the increasing
threat of environmental catastrophe and
it's serious so just take one element
rise in sea levels that's not in
question any longer that sea levels are
rising in fact faster than they have in
recorded history just consider a country
like Bangladesh it's a low-lying coastal
plain
has hundreds of millions of people as
the sea level rises slightly those
people are going to have to flee the
chief environmental scientists of
Bangladesh recently warned that tens of
millions of people are going to have to
flee in the coming years just from sea
level rise and he made an interesting
comment he said that if we lived in a
just world these people would be
admitted into the rich countries the
United States England and others because
those are the countries that are
responsible for and have the capacity to
absorb them that we think we have a
immigrant crisis today which is
non-existent what's it going to be like
when tens of millions of people are
fleeing from rising sea levels and
that's just the beginning just keep the
South Asia the water supply of South
Asia comes mostly from glaciers in the
Himalaya Mountains there melt what
happens when they disappear they're
melting pretty fast there goes the water
supply for South Asia a couple of
billion people in India alone right now
they're already about estimated 300
million people who barely have access to
water what's going to happened then it's
all over the place our coastal cities
are gonna be disappear and the extreme
weather events will increase there
already right now there are about one
person per second is fleeing from the
effects of severe weather that's more
than the number of refugees and that's
going to increase we're facing a major
disaster unless something's done the
fact that in the richest and most
powerful country in world history which
is going to shape what happens for the
future there's a major political party
there the one that happens to dominate
Congress right now which simply denies
that it's happening
they have a policy about global warming
forget it it's not happening okay it's
hard to find words to describe this that
means that there's in the most powerful
country in world history the most
educated the major advantages a major
political party is saying let's bring
let's race to the precipice as quickly
as possible and there's no comment on it
try to find a comment on that fact I
mean what it really means is that this
is the most dangerous organization world
history Republican Party take a look
is that an exaggeration in the primary
Republican primary every single
candidate said it's not happening with
one exception
John Kasich you're supposed to be the
sensible moderate he said yes it's
happening but we shouldn't do anything
about it which is worse so that's a
hundred percent refusal okay the winning
candidate denies that I said that what's
happening is happening and says we
should make it worse we should use more
fossil fuels including coal which is the
most polluting we should eliminate
environmental regulations that we should
refuse to help four countries move to
sustainable energy as was agreed in the
Paris negotiations last year which he
wants to dismantle so in other words
let's race to the precipice as quickly
as possible
meanwhile the threat of nuclear war is
increasing with very provocative actions
on both sides and there's for her little
you know specialists are concerned but
it's not part of the general kind of
conversation
