then once again thanks for coming I've
just want to say that we depend on talk
to Chomsky or professor Chomsky to give
us a story behind this story
and you as you know will often
contradict what we see in the media
thank God for that
and as he informs us we can inform our
community so nothing more needs to be
said by me please give a hand to the
professor Chomsky yes please in the Q&A
bring up anything I mean I asked to talk
about Haiti so talk about that
but lots of other things if any of
you've ever flown into Haiti you've been
greeted by a rather depressing sight
half of the island is green and the
other half is brown the Haiti side is
brown that's partially just ecology the
Dominican Republic side happens to be
just the way the rains go and where the
mountains are and so on it happens to be
more fertile but most of it is man-made
like most catastrophes and that carries
right up to the present the hideous
catastrophe of the earthquake which is
one of the worst in the modern period
hundreds of thousands of people killed
no massive destruction I'm sure you know
all about it it's to a substantial
extent a man-made catastrophe there are
two countries that are primarily
responsible France and the United States
I happen to have come back from a couple
days in Paris a few days ago and I did
try repeatedly to raise the issue in
France but it's very hard to find
anybody who wants to hear about it and I
hope it's a little better in the United
States but the US and
ad and the France owe a tremendous debt
to Haiti and by rights should be paying
massive reparations at this point not
giving aid probably too much to ask for
but it's a goal we ought to have in mind
and the nature of the man-made
catastrophe tells us a lot about what
can be and ought to be done to try to
resurrect some kind of a decent life
well run through the history briefly I'm
sure most of you know it pretty well
Haiti was France's richest colony in
fact probably the richest colony in the
world
in 1789 it produced 75 percent of the
world's sugar
it was the leading producer of cotton
cotton was of course the fuel of the
Industrial Revolution was the leading
producer of the tobacco and a whole
range of other other commodity value
Bowl commodities it's the source of
probably around 20% of France's wealth
something roughly like that the in at
the time of the revolution of course
took place then and turns out there was
no discussion of the right the
liberation of Haiti with all the grand
rhetoric about revolution and equality
and democracy freedom and so on
nevertheless for Haiti did undertake
there was a slave revolt it was the
French turned into a slave Society of
plantation society that devastated the
fragile ecology France also started the
process which is now reached a horrible
level of cutting down the trees because
they wanted to ship them out back to
France to build elegant houses and so on
that denuded the the hills leads to
version more devastation by the time the
French were driven out in 1804 there had
already been very serious damage the war
itself the war of liberation was a
brutal war France was assisted by
massive help from England the main
imperial power by the United States by
others the idea that black people could
gain freedom was really frightening to
the west and but Haiti nevertheless won
its freedom in 1804 it was actually the
first free country of free men in the
hemisphere I stress men because women
had no very few rights here or anywhere
else the I was it was terrifying
particularly to the slave state nearby
the United States the idea that you
would have a free black slave a former
slave country was obviously frightening
Haiti was forced to - it was punished
series of yearly for the crime of
liberating itself and becoming the first
free country France imposed a huge
indemnity which Haiti had to pay there
was another way they could enter the it
would be allowed to enter the
international system in fact they didn't
even pay it off until after the Second
World War and it was a yoke around their
neck all through that period the
harshest punishment was not surprisingly
from the United States the u.s. refused
to recognize Haiti other imperial powers
did so but not the US the u.s. did
finally recognize it in 1862 same yeren
recognize liberia and for the same
reason that was the year of the
Emancipation Proclamation and there was
a problem about what to do with is free
black people we don't want them here as
a terribly racist country on
unbelievably so is that everyone and
that was shipped somewhere so the
thought was well maybe we ship them off
to Liberia and Haiti actually that plan
was dropped about ten years later those
of you who know African American history
will remember that in the entire history
of african-americans in the United
States has been barely a few decades of
a little bit of freedom one of them was
from the set civil war up til 1877 the
reconstruction period after that there
was a compact between the north and the
south which ended that closed the door
on that period of freedom the South was
essentially given authority to
reinstitute slavery in fact something
much worse than slavery they introduced
the was done was to criminalize black
life he looked the wrong way as we
claimed he looked the wrong way at a
white woman charged with attempted rape
and so on pretty soon you had massive a
huge prison population mostly black
males and they were put right back into
the to the cotton fields now in chain
gangs they're put into the minds of you
know the mills US Steel at its Mills
there and so on in fact that's a large
part of the American industrial
revolution based on black slave labor
after the Civil War well that went to
the Second World War Second World War
there was a need for free labor for the
military industries huge growth of
industry during the Second World War and
after that there was a growth period in
the United States for about 20 years and
there were opportunities for the what
would amounted to a new immigrant
population the black population there
were opportunities you know to get job
in the auto plant and a pretty decent
salary
home and so on and so forth all of that
pretty much crashed in the 1970s when
the economic policies were instituted
across the country in fact across a
large part of the world what's called
neoliberalism the economy was
financialized industry was increasingly
without production abroad and so on and
that those job opportunities disappeared
you had this block specialist population
on your hands again so the same solution
was picked that was picked after the
Second World War fertilization so right
from this period around 1980 the prison
population in the United States starts
escalating 1980 was roughly the same as
Europe now maybe five to ten times as
high and mostly black males mostly on
fraudulent drug charges the drug war was
begun at that point as an instrument for
recrimination now we're kind of back to
and they're used for prison prison labor
making license plates and so on it's a
kind of a repetition of the post slavery
period well relate going back to Haiti
the plan to shift the population out to
Haiti and Liberia was sort of shelved
once they became useful as a
criminalized slave population here and
at that point the United States pretty
much took over from France in torturing
Haiti there were dozens of military
interventions in the late 19th century
and into the 20th century the worst of
them was under Woodrow Wilson Wilson in
1915 invaded
hunters of Hispaniola Haiti and the
Dominican Republic both invasions were
pretty brutal worse in Haiti
the reason was racism again in the
Dominican Republic the people are spics
they had a mixture of white blood so
could be treated too badly but in Haiti
they were what were called inferior
people pure niggers so you could do
anything to them and bad as it was in
Dominican Republic it was much worse in
Haiti in Haiti
Wilson essentially reinstated virtual
slavery killed about maybe fifteen
thousand people the marine Marines went
wild all kind of tortured terror you
know war crimes came out of it were
crimes trials came out of it the most
significant part was from a point of
view of the future of Haiti was to kick
out the Parliament the Parliament was
driven out at gunpoint by the Marines
and the reason was they refused to
accept what was called here progressive
legislation new constitution written in
the United States Franklin Delano
Roosevelt actually took credit for
writing it with her truly or not the new
constitution included provisions for
American corporations to buy outpatient
land and that was regarded as very
progressive on good solid economic
theory he obviously needed American
investment and you couldn't expect
American investors to put their money in
Haiti and as they owned it so the only
way to develop Haiti was to allow
American corporations to buy it up and
since the Haitians you know niggers
talking French as William Jennings Bryan
ridiculed them since they didn't
understand complicated ideas like this
he had to disband the Parliament at
gunpoint
and then the Marines did run a
referendum 5% of the population
participated and the US Constitution 1
99.9 percent of the vote so it was all
democratic recall Wilson's the great
exponent of democracy and freedom the 5%
who voted are the wealthy elite there is
a mulatto white a lead which is
devastated Haiti it's a kind of a it's
all over Latin America you have the same
plague
rich societies lots of resources a
terrible misery mass misery but a small
sector of concentrated wealth and power
which tends to be white or mulatto mixed
mixed white sometimes pure white that's
all over the hemisphere Haiti was maybe
worse than anywhere so they voted in the
Constitution they made out fine as they
usually do this allowed the opportunity
for US corporations to essentially
restore something like a plantation
society
the effects were as before to drive lots
of the population off the land the u.s.
left both countries Haiti the Dominican
Republic in the hands of brutal vicious
National Guard's trained by the Marines
the benefactor of the country in
Dominican Republic was Trujillo great
friend of Franklin Delano Roosevelt
among others a murderous killer but
Haiti was much worse it goes on to the
davidic tater ships finally we get to
the 1980s meanwhile the same policies
are being continued 1980s it got much
worse again more progressive economic
theory was in
the World Bank and the US aid devised a
program to turn a Haiti into what they
called the Taiwan of the Caribbean a
flourishing developed society and the
way they were going to do it was by
following policies which happened to be
the exact opposite of what Taiwan did
Taiwan became Taiwan because they
disregarded the advice from the World
Bank and the Western economists and so
on just as every developed society has
done without exception including the
United States so they disregarded it
Taiwan developed distributed the light
industry throughout the country which
led to centers of economic development
which then grew and finally developed
into a very advanced industrial society
in fact a lot most of the high
technology in China comes from Taiwan
and also Japan and South Korea but
primarily Taiwan meanwhile Haiti stayed
Haiti because they followed the advice
they had - it was a gunpoint so they
followed the World Bank US Treasury a US
aid advice which was to drive the
population from the countryside even
more so that before into the cities
where they could pursue their
comparative advantage which was
producing working in assembly plants
us-owned assembly plants stitching
baseballs making textiles horrifying
conditions mostly women the
countryside's again largely emptied the
provisions required that hating cut back
its expenditures for education and for
social services and for public
infrastructure because economic theory
explains that that's a waste you have to
devote resources to export oriented
production they can't produce their own
rice because the u.s. subsidized rice is
much better
they were at Haiti with the Haitian
accrual economy is largely based on pigs
but USA decided that their pigs were no
good they had to kill off all the pigs
lettered percent of them that's a
substantial basis for the peasant
society even culturally there were means
of exchange and so on and they
introduced Iowa pigs sophisticated pigs
to take care of an Iowa Pig requires
more money than a Haitian peasant can
make in ten years
so the Iowa pigs died off and the
Haitian figs were gone and other
progressive measures like that were
undertaken in fact imposed at gunpoint
there were also political developments
in 1986 I guess it was there was
actually an election and baby doc the
second of the two valets won the
election with ninety nine point ninety
eight percent of the vote it was almost
as good as Wilson's election not quite
they Wilson had 99.9 percent the Reagan
administration was very enthusiastic it
spoke of Democratic developments in
Haiti so therefore we have to give the
military Hunt though more military aid
and so on well this went on right
through the 80s again driving people off
the land into the cities laying the
basis for the catastrophes that we see
this had been going on since the French
in 1990 Haitians committed a major crime
which required serious punishment there
was a free election and they voted the
wrong way and you don't do that if you
want to know what happens when you do
that ask the people in Gaza voting the
wrong way in a free election is a major
crime and there's a solution for it you
have to punish the population in Haiti
the nobody expected nobody was paying
any
tension in Haiti - what was happening in
the hills and in these slums but in fact
there was a lot of grassroots organizing
going on and - everybody's amazement
they actually won the election with
two-thirds of the vote voting in a
populous priest Journal Aurora steed the
Americans had a candidate mark boson a
world bank official he got 14 percent of
the vote the u.s. immediately turned to
shifting its aid to Haiti to the
opposition to the business-led
opposition the white mulatto business
led opposition to try to lay the basis
for overthrowing the government what
made the crime even worse was that our
state's policies were successful in fact
recognized as successful by the IMF and
the inter-american Development Bank and
others who praised his steps towards
reducing the stifling bureaucracy
towards putting the country social
spending which was required and so on
and it really looked for a little while
as if Haiti might only might not only
become free and democratic which is bad
enough but it might fall out of US hands
which is even worse well the expected
military coup took place seven months
after our state's election the
Organization of American States imposed
an embargo the u.s. technically joined
the embargo but within about a few weeks
George Bush number one he was president
then he modified the terms of the
embargo he carried out something that
the New York Times praised as
fine-tuning the embargo for the benefit
of the Haitian people the fine-tuning
was to allow US corporations to violate
the embargo great for the Haitian people
but it's a usual kind of progressive
action that's taken praised so the
embargo was undermine right away
the trade with Haiti increased in fact
the the members of the elite who were
the rich elite who were closely involved
with the military hunt though they were
freely shopping in Miami you know
enjoying themselves making a lot of
money the technically the bush and then
later Clinton issued a directive
presidential directive blocking oil
shipments to the military hunter I
happened to be there at the time in 1993
it was a horrible terror hideous terror
you know thousands of people killed
murders I was there right in the middle
of it and you could see that oil farms
being built in for the prints but the
CIA was reporting to Congress that all
oil shipments had been stopped thanks to
the presidential directive it was later
learned that Bush and particularly
Clinton secretly a permitted Texaco oil
company to send oil in violation of the
presidential directive this discovery
was so prominent that you couldn't miss
it it was the lead story on AP the day
before the marine invasion when everyone
had their eyes glued the AP and the
press managed to suppress it it was
reported in The Wall Street Journal a
couple of industry journals a couple of
minor papers here and there but almost
nobody knows about it
that's Clinton actually under Clinton a
trade with Haiti increased even beyond
Bush the terror increased by finally in
1994 Clinton apparently decided that the
patients had been tortured enough he
allowed send in the Marines mainly to
protect the Hunta and the wealthy and
allowed the President to return the
elected President to return but on very
harsh condition
the conditions for our steeds returned
were that he accept the electoral
program of the defeated candidate in the
1990 election a very harsh neoliberal
program so for example no import
restrictions and no subsidies - for
development and so on well the
consequences that are pretty obvious and
they were understood immediately so USA
came out right away with a report saying
that the effect of this will be to
destroy what's left of Haitian
agriculture for good reasons hate Asian
rice farmers are quite efficient but
they can't possibly compete with us
agribusiness which is getting maybe 40
percent of its income from US subsidies
government subsidies of course it'll
wipe it out and that's considered a good
thing because remember their comparative
advantage is not producing rice it's
better for economic reasons for them to
import highly subsidized the US rice
they're supposed to go back to assembly
plants so that was very progressive and
it did destroy a Haitian rice farming
staple staple of the food economy so the
country had been self-sufficient now it
imports almost everything there were
small businesses a few small businesses
that somehow managed to survive but they
couldn't survive these policies either
so for example one small business that
was working and hey was producing
chicken parts how they do raise chickens
and the factory was making chicken parts
well turns out Americans don't like dark
meat so there's an excess of dark meat
in the corporations like Tyson and the
other big ones then I would do with it
so they tried to dump it well they tried
to dump it in Mexico and Canada but they
have functioning governments so they
could use anti-dumping laws and prevent
it but Haiti
thanks to
Clinton is not permitted to block meat
that's dumped from Tyson and others so
that poured in and that wiped out this
little industry and that's the picture
across the board
I mean to Clinton's credit a couple of
weeks ago he did make an apology sort of
he said he didn't understand that when
he imposed these conditions that it
would he said the conditions he imposed
were very good for arc and Arkansas rice
producers didn't mention the chicken
industries they were very good for
Arkansas rice producers but they did
wipeout Haitian rice production he
couldn't figure that out at the time
couldn't read the US aid report or so
and so forth but he did apologize which
is very rare I mean I have to say that's
almost unique case in history try to
find something like it but that it was
clear that that was going to happen it
did happen if this helped destroy what
was left to the country in 2000 RSD the
wasn't election our state was elected
again handily he the u.s. at that point
this is now Bush to blocked any any aid
to Haiti on spurious grounds they also
blocked international aid so it entered
aid from the International
inter-american Development Bank and
somes all blocked Haiti had to continue
paying interest on the aid that it
wasn't receiving it was not allowed to
get the aid so of course that's another
horrible blow to the country I mean
while there one or after another
disasters taking place I mean a tropical
storm goes through the region it'll kill
thousands of people in Haiti maybe two
people in Cuba same storm but different
societies any mild a minor event in
Haiti is going to be mad
if I'd because of the destruction that's
been imposed on the population there
were in 2008 there were food prices rose
very sharply over the world and there
were food riots all over the place the
first ones were in Haiti because their
food supply has been destroyed you know
people are starving well in 2004 the
traditional torturers of Haiti France
and the United States helped by Canada
swept in kidnapped the president sent
him off to Central Africa the United
stand we imposed their own military
regime led to another wave of Terror the
US has been trying to keep our state out
of the hemisphere that one or two
countries haven't agreed but certainly
not going to let him back into Haiti and
come in that were up to today when the
earthquake came along a couple of months
ago in January was it was a serious
earthquake but that for example there
was a much more serious earthquake in
Chile a couple of weeks later and that
one killed a couple hundred people this
one killed maybe 250,000 people and
devastated the society and it's a
man-made catastrophe to a large extent
our state did politely approach France a
couple of years ago and request that
maybe it's time to eat give them a
little help to overcome the effect of
this horrifying indemnity that they
imposed the France did establish a
committee a government committee led by
a resister Bray or leftist they
determined that there was no merit in
the request so that was dismissed the
we're now up to now I mean there is a
fair amount of quite a lot of money
coming in the question is what should be
done with it my
as it shouldn't be called aid it should
be a fraction of the reparations that
are required edit by any honest
standards and it should go I think to
the popular organizations despite all of
the hideous destruction that's taken
place in Haiti over many years it still
retains a lively functioning civil
society the ones who swept our state
into office in 1990 in unbelievable
poverty unless you've been there you
just can't fathom it I've been in a lot
of awful places but nothing like that
but still it goes on they're functioning
there lively they have ideas and they're
the ones who will be taking
responsibility for and giving an
opportunity to try to rebuild something
from this wreckage of centuries of
Imperial destruction but whether that
happens or not or how it happens is
basically up to people like you so I'll
stop there
doctor chomps he will take your
questions I also want to mention that we
have his latest book hopes and prospects
for sale down in our visitors center I
would like to ask you if you could
comment a bit on the role of the United
Nations in Haiti if you will if it has
been something that's been in line with
the World Bank and the IMF approach or
has been separate and if you could talk
about the UN's role in the world per se
as an institution is it doing more
damage or do you make a difference
between UN agencies like UNICEF and all
versus like broadly the UN agencies in
Haiti in Haiti if you could comment on
that and also on the world i i worked
briefly with the UN i'm trying to figure
out how to get out of it and try to you
you were involved with you an agency
yeah and i just like to forget my moral
compass right with you but by and large
i mean it you know if you've worked with
UN you know what it's like it's a very
cumbersome bureaucracy with a lot of
corruption and it's pretty awful but by
and large they do about as well as they
can under those conditions the
constraints on the UN are the great
powers mainly the u.s. of course the
most important power in the case of
haiti the UN did complain publicly that
as did other aid agencies that they
weren't able to introduce aid because
when the US when obama said in you know
the immediate reaction of the United
States was descendant a huge military
contingent which took over the airport
and the aid agencies including the UN
claimed that aid shipments were blocked
while soldiers were being shipped in and
so on but as far as I know they you know
they've done a fairly decent job I mean
the question is where the aid is going
to and what form it will take will it
take a form that allows the people of
Haiti to the popular organized
years of Haitian society to work out
ways to try to reconstruct their own
country there are a lot of things that
have to be done I mean not just economic
development also cultural change so for
example everyone in Haiti speaks Creole
a small sector mostly wealthy speak
French the official language is French
the language of schools is French
if you speak Creole like you're 95
percent of the population you barely
know French you're kind of a
second-class citizen
there's no reason for that just to stay
the educational program ought to be
revamped so that they can use their own
language and should become you know the
language of the society not French is a
residue from the days of French
imperialism and it's the language of the
rich of course and but that's secondary
to the problems of economic development
which are really extraordinary I mean
for one thing the countryside has to be
rebuilt you can't decide he can't
survive with the huge mass of people
crammed into slums and port-au-prince so
that means a lot of it means the kind of
development that actually did take place
in Taiwan
you know distributing development to
different parts of the country with
state organised the subsidies industrial
policy designed to carry out the balance
sustainable development that can succeed
as it did in Taiwan for example share
our own country's a an example itself
under the you liver when the United
States won its freedom in 1786 there was
advice from the leading economists of
the day Adam Smith in particular advised
the United States on what it should do
to grow and develop his advice was
pretty much what economists give the
so-called developing world today the
United States he said should concentrate
on its compare
advantage they use the term then but
that's what was the things we're good at
we should be producing exporting fish
and fur and the primary agricultural
products and we should be importing
industrial goods from England which
where they were much more advanced and
instead of trying to produce in Dustin
develop an industrial society here that
would violate all the laws of economics
and would be much better much better for
if the United States followed those
policies pretty much the same advice
that the Treasury Department the World
Bank the economics profession and so on
gives to the third world today a Smith
also urged that the United States not
try to institute a monopoly over the
primary products that it produces
because you can prove an economic theory
and so on that that's you know that bad
for the world economy well the US was a
sovereign country and it could therefore
follow its own policies so it rejected
all of those policies 100% Alexander
Hamilton who sort of created the US
economy immediately imposed very high
import duties to block superior British
textiles and other manufacturers and
that enabled the United States to
develop at first the textile industry
goes on later steel industry actually
the US had the highest protection in the
world and also the highest growth rate
and the correlation is not accidental
as far as monopolies are concerned the
u.s. tried very hard to gain a monopoly
of cotton cotton was a very it's like
oil today you know it was the fuel with
the Industrial Revolution and the US was
producing a lot of it but not all the
u.s. conquered Texas and half of Mexico
as you know on a prime goal was to try
to gain a monopoly of cotton production
and US presidents like Tyler argued that
if we can control if we can monopolize
if we can control cotton production we
can bring England to its feet England
was the great anime then remember that
was the powerful military force and they
were deterrent the US couldn't conquer
Canada couldn't conquer Cuba because of
British military force but if we could
monopolize cotton we could bring England
to its feet and then we could you know
expand and so on so if the u.s. tried
very hard to monopolize cotton and
succeeded pretty well actually Adam
Smith's prediction which to repeat is it
pretty much the same as the instructions
given to the third world today we're
based on solid economic theory and it's
probably the most spectacularly refuted
prediction in history but that's the way
countries grow and develop if you can
find an exception
we'll try it's not you know it's it's
pretty striking that the one country of
the south know that not none you know
outside of Europe in the United States
the one country that developed Japan is
the one country it wasn't colonized and
it also could therefore violate the the
injunctions of the leaders of economic
thought none of the wealthy powers well
Haiti didn't have that hasn't had that
luck but unless it has the capacity to
gain truly gain sovereignty and have the
capacity to run its own it to carry
carry out it a form of development
that's appropriate for the society the
way Taiwan did in South Korea and others
then it's not going to have much of a
future it will be a colonial dependency
as it has been but that's really you
know they can't do it on their own
that's something we have to do so it's
in Haiti about a month ago
is not getting to the people it's not
getting to where it is supposed to go
with all of the NGOs that are in Haiti
more so than any other country we
quickly we managed to get on the
compound of the International Red Cross
33 nation-states
and the lack of luxury that they enjoy
even going to an Italian restaurant and
that's just juxtaposed to the way the
Haitians are living in these tent cities
and neighborhoods the the difference is
more than striking however my question
is about the popular resistance that we
begin to see that have emerged on the
streets it really started before the
before the earthquake at the University
a leading University professor was
murdered and so something has been
growing on the streets for a long time
so I wonder if you could give us your
sense of what's happening with this
popular resistance it seems to be very
definitely tied into a very structural
organized way with the leadership in the
in the tent city neighborhoods that are
very structured and very impressive with
the people whom I spoke to and what are
your thoughts about that and where might
this lead to in terms of challenging the
structural adjustment and developing
program clearly a Canada the US and
France that has nothing to do with the
needs of the Haitian people yeah what
you described is unfortunately pretty
common when the NGOs the NGO a lot of
the NGOs are quite good you know some of
them do really good work but there's a
kind of an NGO culture which is really
like vultures and they wait till a
catastrophe comes somewhere and they
flood in and pick up the money that's
being poured in from the wealthy
countries and
and they live just like you described I
mean they go to the fancy restaurants
you know they live at a salary they live
at a level wavy it above the population
which causes all sorts of problems and
it hurts aid away from where it oughta
go into the hands of the Western run
NGOs and I'm not surprised to hear that
something like that's happening in Haiti
there are constructive things that could
be done the main one is what you say
there has been for a long time it's kind
of amazing but there have been a very
lively active engaged public local
organizations activist organizations of
the most striking case of it was just
our steeds election and then repeated
election every kept on this an election
the same thing happens and they're there
and we have to figure out ways to get
the aid into their hands for them to run
maybe joint projects in which they take
over actually the most effective NGO and
Haiti that I know of and it really has
been good works just like that that's
poor farmers partners and health
programs they set up back in the mid 80s
of a clinic in the one of the poorest
areas of rural Haiti and Paul and others
who work there made sure that Haitians
took it over so it's now pretty much run
by Haitian paramedics Haitian doctors
and others they if they need some kind
of sophisticated surgery the doctor will
fly down from Boston or something but
it's pretty much run by by Haitians and
very effective went it right through the
earthquake it was there were people
pouring in from all over way beyond the
anything they could handle and that's
the way to do it you know to develop
institutions that are taken over by the
local population and run by them in
their own way and they can do things
that the outsiders can't do
so if you want to say that have you no
maternal aide for a woman in a rural
village off of the hill somewhere
I mean Haitian paramedic can do it but
the Western doctors can't and it's
pretty much the same in every area
actually there are other things that
could be done on a national level so one
proposal which came from the center for
economic and policy research very good
Economic Research Institute is that the
United States should buy up the entire
Haitian rice crop at a decent price
beyond above the market price well that
would be a tremendous subsidy to Haitian
rice farmers it would enable them to it
would also mean of course means buy it
up and give it to the Haitian people it
would be a have a major effect on the
serious malnutrition it would give a
shot in the arm to domestic production
and of course the other thing that ought
to be done not just for Haiti but for
the whole world is for the Western
countries the United States and Europe
to put an end to the agricultural
subsidies which are destroying
agriculture all over the world you know
poor countries can't compete with highly
subsidized Western agribusiness Europe
is even worse than the United States and
disrespect and that ought to be totally
gone now Haiti's debt ought to be
completely eliminated it's totally
what's called odious debt as doesn't has
no legitimacy and there are other steps
that can be taken at a general
policymaking level but the main one is
the one you talk about aid should go to
the local functioning organizations
whether it's educational assistance
technical projects agricultural
development community development
whatever it may be and that's going to
take a lot of pressure from the
population here and it should happen in
four
and so far as I know nothing's going on
in France for the truth the
characterization of heiress deed
requesting help from France I think one
of the major reasons why there was this
vindictive element was because he was
quite strident although eloquent in that
he was not requesting aid he was
actually discussing how they would not
reach a level of basic moral development
without accepting the fact that their
wealth was based upon their poverty and
that they should provide to Haiti what
is rightfully Haiti's so I think that
was a one element um well yeah I mean I
I read the same things you did and it
could be looked at that way but I
regarded that as polite right but I
guess emphasis on reparations for
historical injustice versus aid is
something that that plays a factor in
that it's true but he should I mean I
didn't I thought it should even been
stronger but I thought it was a fair
statement he should I'm in France
destroyed the country France enriched
itself by destroying the country they
imposed a burden on the country that
prevented it from developing for ever
since its liberation for the crime of
liberation under those conditions it
seems to me pretty fair to ask for
reparations sure I wanted to ask you
because of the work that you've done on
intellectual culture and the media and
and that realm of policy what is it that
allows people like Clinton to go in
front of the congressional committee and
and say things like you know I'm going
to have to live with this regret for the
rest of my life every day and also
another
is Jeffrey Sachs who you've condemned in
the harshest words for his work in
Bolivia and in the Eastern Bloc who
became a quite vigorous and a pretty
fair advocate for Haiti during the time
where the rest of the intellectual
culture was demonizing it so I want to
ask you what about those particular
aspects how does that relate to this
doctrinal system that you discuss fact
that occasionally somebody does decent
thing doesn't tell you the doctrinal
system isn't there
I mean Clinton's statement was good and
I'm glad he made it as I think I
mentioned it's practically unique and
imperial history try to find something
like it it was nowhere near what he
should have said I mean it was just like
a fraction of what he should have said
but it's good that he said it there was
a little commentary about it if you do a
media search you won't find much and I
didn't see any commentary explaining
what it meant and what the background
was in the case of Jeff Sachs he's you
know he continues he certainly has
shifted his position very substantially
from the time that he was going for a
shock therapy for in Russia which led to
utter catastrophe practically destroyed
the economy harsh neoliberal programs in
Bolivia which had a horrible effect and
yeah he's revised his positions and is
doing good things praise him for it what
lessons do you see fund me level s and
that decade two decades rather of
popular participation what are the
lessons that we can apply from that to
the United States what are the different
scenarios and impediments that the
United States has that perhaps are
unique that prevent us from creating a
popular based movement like fund me
level us thank you that's an important
question I mean it's quite striking that
we and other
Western countries can't reach can't even
approach can't even dream about the
level of democracy that they hadn't
Katie I mean is pretty shocking now
here's one of the poorest countries in
the world that were took the population
that did organize to win that election
are among the most repressed and
impoverished in the world and they
managed to organize to enough to enter
the electoral arena without any
resources and to elect their own
candidate I mean is it believable that
we can't do the same it's a it's not the
only case I mean the same thing happened
in Bolivia a couple years ago I mean the
indigenous population which is you know
the most repressed in the continent over
a couple over some years this is
overcoming the effects of the policies
that Jeff Sachs had helped impose they
began to take their fate into their own
hands it began well before the election
the into the elections in 2005 but in
2000 there was there were what were
called the water wars in Bolivia the
World Bank and huge international
corporations Bechtel here or one from
France we're trying to privatize water
and again you know in an economic
seminar you can prove a theorem that
says it's more efficient to privatize
water footnote most people can't afford
it so they don't drink but you know you
can't have everything perfect so they
tried to privatize water the mostly
Indian population rejected it they
demonstrated they protested it became
pretty violent a lot of them were killed
by the security forces but they finally
succeeded in tossing out the
international corporations in the World
Bank that was done with
International Solidarity that's also
important they carried the main action
that they were carrying out in
Cochabamba happen to be at the same time
that there were protests here at the
World Bank and in Washington and they
were coordinated so thanks to the
internet they could be coordinated
there were also protests around the
world at the home offices of the main
corporations and that combination of
international solidarity and protest on
the ground won a big victory and then
they went on from there they went on to
other issues and finally they reached
the point where they could enter the
electoral arena that the majority of the
population and they won an election in
2005 they elected someone from their own
ranks who are peasant the issues were
very real everybody knew what they were
control over resources problems of
justice
multiple it's a very multi-ethnic
societies of complex questions of
cultural rights and the election was
they were well organized for the
election won it elected during that
person someone from their own ranks in
fact but that was just a moment in
ongoing struggles then they go back and
continue the other struggles well you
know that's functioning democracy it's
beyond anything we can conceive of here
it's a and that's a that's a problem
about the United States and Europe you
know and the other and wealthy
industrial countries the concept of
democracy has just been so impoverished
that it's we have to go to the poorest
countries in the world to see what
democracy means and yeah we can take
lessons
from that lessons that we should apply I
mean anything they've done we can do a
thousand times more easily so fine let's
do it to do it you have to first know
about it and draw the lessons your
response to the situation in Gaza now
and the similarity between the suffering
of the Palestinian people and the
Haitian people and both of them victims
of racism there there are similarities I
mentioned one the Haitians and the
Palestinians were both punished severely
for the crime of voting the wrong way I
mean the harsh punishment of Gaza has
been miserably treated for a long time
but it really escalated in January 2006
and the reason was very straight forward
you'd read it on the front page of the
New York Times in fact you could read
adjacent columns on the front page of
the New York Times one of which praised
the United States for its dedication to
democracy and all wonderful things and
the one right next to it by Steven angle
Berg said that the you it was the day
after the couple days after the election
that the US and Israel are going to
impose harsh sanctions on Palestinians
for voting the wrong way and the only
free elections when I take a place in
the Arab world and as far as I can see
that didn't elicit a whisper of protest
even comment yeah sure okay we people
vote the wrong way I got a punishment in
Gaza the punishment was severe the siege
was imposed it went to the extent that
Israel even blocked water from the arid
Garet Gaza Strip in the months that
followed the violence increased in fact
by by June Israel had fired seven
thousand seven hundred rockets into the
strip and it was
currents and killings and so on without
going through the whole history it the
punishment picked up much more harshly a
year later in June 2007 what happened
then is that the US and Israel and the
Palestinian Authority that tried to
carry out a military coup in Gaza to
overthrow the elected government and to
institute the rule of a Fatah strongman
I'm a doll on well the crew who the coup
was beaten back and Hamas took over and
that's when the punishment really became
savage and this incident is described
here as proof of you know Hamas
terrorism how could they dare not accept
a us-run military coup that was designed
to overthrow the elected government and
it just goes on from there by now it's a
you know it's not the worst crime in the
world but it's surely one of the most
savage I mean Israel's keeping the
population as kind of caged animals
they're not letting them all die because
that would cause too much of an
international uproar but they're barely
permitting them to survive I mean the
must you take a look at the restrictions
on goods that can go in and it's
shocking pencils medicines and almost
anything you can think of anything
beyond their survival is blocked Egypt
cooperates over the last couple of days
it's backed off the United States of
course cooperates the Israel is also
regularly attacking Gaza one thing it
just goes in and kills people if it
feels like but it's also trying to drive
people away from the borders
that's fertile land so driving away from
the borders with constant attacks
gunfire and so on
it's also been driving them away from
the away from their territorial waters
so Israeli gunship
over the past 10 years have been driving
fishermen closer and closer to the shore
by now they can't go out more than a few
miles from the shore which kills the
fishing industry and for one reason
because this sewage and power plants
have been destroyed so by the Israeli
attacks so everything the near the shore
so totally polluted you can't fish maybe
it's coincidence maybe it isn't but
these attacks on Gaza fishermen which
all of this is of course criminal I mean
enough won't even talk it happens to be
in violation of Security Council
resolution 1860 which called for an end
of the siege but you know the idea of
talking about law when you bring up
something that the United States and
Israel are doing is like a bad joke so
yes it's illegal known to be illegal but
in fact that Security Council resolution
passed 14 to 0 with one abstention you
can guess who the abstention was that
means it's inapplicable but so of course
it's criminal the to get back to the sea
in the year in 1999 the British Gas
major British gas company discovered
apparently substantial reserves of
natural gas off the coast of Gaza in
fact all along the eastern Mediterranean
but particularly in the territorial
waters of Gaza
well Israel of course wants the gas and
right at that point they started driving
fishing boats out of their own
territorial waters towards land and in
fact Israel has been negotiating with
the British Gas to to contracting to get
the oil that's extracted from Gaza and
territorial waters well there was a look
like that
I and a couple of other people tried to
initiate some enquiries and protests
about that there could be a court case
about it in Britain but there's a
hangout that turns out which terminated
the enquiries Palestinian authorities
involved they're covering for it
so there and once you reach that barrier
the enquiries can't go on there's a lot
of ugly things there but back your point
it's yeah it's the punishment of Gaza
really took off after they voted the
wrong way in a free election very
similar to Haiti in that respect it's
not the only case and it's pretty ugly I
mean to the current example you know the
flotilla which you'll read about that's
multiplied criminal for one thing
attacking ships in international waters
is of course a crime violation of every
principle of maritime law killing people
when you do it is even a worse crime
here it's accepted so if you look at the
commentary here say the New York Times
it's run a couple of op eds on it almost
every one is from an Israeli government
official or some sympathizer I'm going
to have to be listening to NPR in the
liberal voice a couple of days ago I
tortured myself with that every once in
a while so they have two commentators
from what's book called the left and the
right who comment on the week's events
that David Brooks and EJ de Young and I
happened to catch that segment they were
asked what they thought about the attack
on the flotilla and they were kind of
competing with one another to see who
could be more vociferous and supporting
I mean that's the realm of discussion in
the
States I should say I think the u.s. is
off the international spectrum on this I
haven't seen anything like that in any
other country but here it's almost the
uniform support for in articulate
opinion at least which is not surprising
because the u.s. is doing it so of
course this total support you're
articulate classes furthermore it's
worth bearing in mind that Israel has
been doing this for about thirty years
for decades they've been attacking ships
in international waters from Cyprus to
Lebanon and capturing them killing
people kidnapping them often they've
kidnapped people and put them into
secret Israeli prisons they have a big
kind of gulag of their own which in
holding them as hostages
you know openly keeping them as hostages
and of course the u.s. Pat's him on the
back so they can keep doing it well this
is another case this one happened to
elicit some international attention now
Israel's justification for it is that
they have to protect themselves from
rocket fire from Gaza well putting aside
any question about do you have to kill
people and stop ships at sea to block
that the whole thing is a total force
you can't discuss this in the United
States but the facts are very clear
Israel knows precisely how to stop
rockets precisely the u.s. knows too
they can except Hamas is offered to
reinstitute a truce there was a truce
instituted in June 2008 Israel agreed to
the truths they claimed they said they'd
open the borders and they partially did
but not completely and in return how I
said that it would stop all rocket
firing I did you can read that on the
Israeli government web page Mark Regev
the Israeli government spokesman who
on television all the time giving
apologetics he said publicly if for some
British television where he was asked he
said he agreed y'all rocket-firing and
stop so you want to stop rocket-firing
agree to the truth well that went on
that was June 2008 went on until
November of 2008 November Israel invaded
the Gaza Strip killed half a dozen Hamas
activists then rocket fire started both
directions everyone was killed with
Palestinian of course Hamas offered to
reinstitute the truce the Israeli
cabinet considered the offer we have
this from Israeli sources they
considered the offer and rejected it
because they wanted to use violence and
that then comes Operation Cast Lead to
invade Gaza on the pretext that they
have to stop the rocket firing now
there's a lot of debate about the you
know was the attack on Gaza
disproportionate and so on so beside the
point you know you cannot use force in
self-defense
unless you've exhausted peaceful means
and in this case they refused even to
try peaceful means presumably because
the US and Israel has every reason to
believe they'd worked and then you
wouldn't be able to impose use force but
all the discussion about this is kind of
like off the wall it's in some other
universe and that's approximately a
hundred percent and it's about the same
in Europe I'm sorry to say which tales
along behind the United States on this
and the same is true about the flotilla
there is no justification whatsoever on
grounds of self-defense since they have
peaceful means to defend themselves
except the ceasefire okay so the whole
thing is completely without any
justification we live a
mentally-challenged world because of the
media that is so well described over the
year
making it impossible to sort things out
clearly and odd groups here we function
in a kind of like a huge umbrella of
progressive groups that are trying what
it is Haiti or Palestine to make the
people suffer a little bit less that
seems to be maximum goal since they're
not to really be able to possibly change
anything but just maybe a little less
suffering oh this this recent Institute
incident with Helen Thomas saying
something knows which is you know
outrageous probably when the year the
fact that she says you know these people
were settlers they came from bowling and
and god bless in Holocaust but you know
the Holocaust was a white clear colonial
world phenomenon it was and for the
complicity that the right world which
was the top world fell for this they
gave this partition of British
protectorate Palestine this kind of a
deal and the major mankind which is made
up of non-white people they've never
brought that idea is it is it beneficial
to go back into history into history you
know how could we do more than just the
progressives trying to make people
listen there's a lot of things we can do
we can't go out and start organizing
steel workers because we don't work in
steel plants ok so you can do work where
you are you can't do work where you
aren't you know
well we a lot of us live in you know
educated some academic some professional
communities and so a lot can be done
there for one of the things that can be
done is to compel ourselves to recognize
history if you give up history
you've lost the basis for doing lots of
important things and Haiti is a perfect
example if we could get to the point of
recognizing the history we could see the
kinds of things that we ought to do and
we're capable of doing and that's across
the board I mean you know you mentioned
the Holocaust you know maybe the most
hideous destruction in history but it's
not the only case of mass genocide I
mean let's take us right here we live
here because the indigenous population
was exterminated that's the word that
was used by the founding fathers they
were there that hapless race of North
Americans that were exterminated by the
most Presidio's cruelty that's that's us
you know do we accept it well you can
read the New York Review of Books for
example no the left liberal most
important left liberal intellectual
journal in the world and you can read an
article there about a year ago which
says that the win by a good decent
leftish commentator which says that when
Columbus arrived in the United States
for he found an empty continent with
maybe a million people wandering around
the kind of hunter-gatherers you know it
couldn't so there's basically no one
here well you know he's off by maybe a
hundred million and they had advanced
societies pretty much like the Europeans
except in the means of destruction there
wasn't I waited to see there was not one
single letter that appeared to say wait
a minute that's here off by a hundred
million you know and it was mass
genocide you know well okay if the
history can be erased to that extent
we're not going to be able to face the
problems that exist I just came down
this morning on a on a train from
and I was having to be reading a journal
journal diplomatic history that's of all
the international journal scholarly
journals on international affairs that's
the one that's most open you know it has
most critical and so on
alright this issue happened to be
devoted to the Vietnam War so I read
through the issue and some interesting
work on it here and there are a lot of
scholarship plenty of footnote this is
just one thing missing not there is not
one word saying that there might have
been something wrong about invading
another country killing four million
people destroying it destroying a couple
other countries on the side the only the
closest it came to that was saying well
maybe as a mistake okay if that's recent
history you know which many of us were
involved in but it's been history's been
repro created by the conquerors by the
Imperial culture and you prettified so
that we're protected from it well you
know if we allow our own communities to
protect themselves from the actual
history there isn't going to be much in
the way of constructive actions so yeah
I think history is important and it's a
battleground that order we shouldn't be
conceited about ten thousand people read
a demonstration and they began to burn
these seeds that Monsanto is forcing on
them which are the you remember these
kind of seeds that they don't reproduce
they're genetically modified they can
blow over into the dr so this is a
horror show the peasant
mints too little toward food sovereignty
and reconstructing the agriculture in
Haiti have you're absolutely right I'm
glad you brought that up I mean this you
know it's it's Monsanto but the US
government is behind it which means we
can do a lot about it and what it is is
just as you say it's a way of ensuring
that Haitian farmers are captive these
seeds do not reproduce I mean apart from
the fact that they may you know spread
around destroy other things the farmers
themselves cannot use the seeds the next
season they have to go back to Monsanto
to purchase the seeds and purchase the
fancy fertilizers and so on so it's kind
of like destroying the pigs it's another
way of capturing the agricultural
population making sure they can't
reconstitute a decent life and it's
being done by advanced technology your
taxes my taxes and so on and the idea of
organizing to send them real seeds
that's really important and that's only
very constructive that can be done but
also there's an educational aspect to it
as you pointed out so very glad you
brought that up you spoke about Paul
Farmer I'm very interested in how you
see the you know the things playing out
politically with this committee
Commission co-chaired by Clinton who
you're very critical of poor farming
away made the step to be formal part of
this by being the right hand of Clinton
actually what about his participation in
the Commission with Clinton and others
yeah well I was wondering I mean this
this seems such an odd couple and at the
same time so much is riding on this
right I mean we have a government that's
not really functional we have the
Clintons who have been promoting plants
that probably most of us don't like
sweatshops and this kind of thing and
then we have Paul Farmer they're popping
up who is taking the lead talking to
ngos and so on and I'm trying to find
out which the
as long as Clinton gonna listen to poor
farmer is poor farmer really inferential
did he make the wrong step to be part of
his oil Co form please
I'm sure he's cutting corners but you
know I personally trust him I think he's
probably making the right decisions I
don't know exactly what's going on in
that commission it's nobody it's secret
you know but you can see that there must
be internal conflicts now he knows
perfectly well what Clinton's record was
and he's decided I suspect for good
reasons that it's the best of bad
alternatives now is to cooperate with it
and see if it can be moved into a
healthier direction for the people of
Haiti and I think he has good judgment
and so without knowing the details I
kind of assumed that what it's doing is
the right thing
and do you see the Haitian government
really playing a role in this because
you do you see the Haitian government
Haitian yeah SP government barely exists
you know unfortunately yeah I mean it's
first it's got to exist yeah um thank
you so much and I also have sort of
another question that might be seem sort
of vague and abstract and I think you've
someone adjusted that in what would you
say that pragmatic solidarity going back
to Paul Farmer really consists I mean
kind of on a daily basis he writes that
when we regard the perpetrators of
structural violence from a comfortable
reserve we automatically have sorry but
I'm not hearing very well I'm sorry oh
so don't have to pop them away I wanted
to ask what you would say
so very consistent I mean in general
about so they already work yeah it
consists of our daily basis I guess
pragmatically speaking I kind of don't
think there's a lot that can be said at
a sort of an abstract level you got to
go to the particular cases let's so take
say the case of Monsanto seeds okay
here's a case where solid I already work
can do something very constructive for
one thing it can spread understanding
among the population about what this
means it's not a charitable gift from
Monsanto in the United States it's a way
to ensure that Haitian farmers remain
captives and second you can do something
to counter like the program of
organizing seeds and the same in case
after case you just can't say anything
general you have to work through the
cases and figure out what's the way to
interact with suffering people so as to
help them not to help NGOs as somebody
pointed out it's at least I don't know
how to make it general comment on it
yeah it really just depends on the
particular case and each case has to be
thought of that because they all have
consequences and bringing pressure to
bear on elected officials and things
like that I mean how much I mean I guess
organizing and protesting is one thing
but one one-day protest and soon what
about a protest I mean organizing a
protest oh is one thing that how
effective do you think that is well you
know a protest makes sense if it's part
of an ongoing activity a protest which
is just of the kind of unfortunately we
have too many of I'm going to out and
put this and I'll go back home and go
back to my ordinary
life that's a kind of a feel-good
purpose but the kind of protest that
took place say in Cochabamba about the
privatization of war that's a real
protest because yes they did have
demonstration that day but then the next
day they went on and did something else
so if protests are part of an active on
ongoing engagement yes it can be very
valuable so I take say the anti-war
protests in the late 60s they were
events at least for the serious people
they were single events which just got
people together mobilize them you know
made themselves visible as part of the
day-to-day activities that they were
engaged in educational activist and so
on and that's that's what purpose would
it be otherwise it's it's kind of like
our fuel qoodles see my friend regarding
Taiwan Japan and South Korea can it not
be said that the United States gave them
a great deal of slack because of the
dire communist threat owing to the
Chinese Revolution and the Korean War
and I suppose that could also be said of
Germany and Western Europe I mentioned
this because the u.s. allowed import and
other controls and some like industry in
the Philippines under president Kirino
in the late 1940s because of the
Communists who Plath threat at the time
through the third one and then you talk
about Taiwan right by the I'm
contrasting yeah and then in the
Philippines when they force pool that
control
under President Macapagal in 1960 once a
communist threat was quashed
now however in Iraq Afghanistan Egypt
and Jordan the favored method to counter
the Islamic threat seems to be massive
bribery yeah look I'm not suggesting
that Taiwan South Korea Japan and so on
our lovely models to follow in fact that
you're right I mean the United States
gave them a certain slack to violate the
rules because of for geopolitical
reasons but the point that I was making
is a different one they developed by
following the same basically the same
principles that the United States and
other developed societies applied and by
violating the rules that are imposed on
the weak they in do it a pretty way by
any means like South Korea was a
terrible dictatorship which the US bank
but that's how they developed and the
countries that do not have sovereignty
do not control their own economic life
and cannot enter the mark and do not
have the capacity to enter the market on
their own terms
they became the third world okay in fact
it cheap an remember developed long
before it started developing in the late
1860's and in fact strether strikingly
at the time that japan began its process
of modernization and industrialization
they were roughly in the same stage of
state formation economic growth and so
on as west africa it's been discussed by
a number of african historians correctly
i think they were approximately in the
same state well japan developed west
africa became a monstrosity why who was
under
control did not have sovereignty there
are many other such cases now it takes a
Egypt if you go back to around the 1820s
Egypt was poised for economic
development and industrialization and it
was you know can't can't that draw
connections too closely but it was
roughly in the same state as the United
States it had a rich agriculture
that's why Napoleon conquered it had
cotton rich resources cotton which were
very important than it had a national
government at Polly's government which
was starting a program of modernization
industrialization roughly at the same
time the United States did well the
United States had sovereignty England
British Egypt didn't in fact the British
made it very explicit in almost so many
words that they were not going to permit
a competitor in the eastern
Mediterranean and the British and the
French just crashed it okay so Egypt is
Egypt and we're the United States and
there are many cases like that you're
right in saying that the specific mode
of development was extremely ugly in
many ways but what was significant about
it was that it did follow principles of
economic sovereignty and independence
and controlling the means by which they
could develop sometimes it's done badly
sometimes done well but unless you have
that those options you can't develop at
all and at the economic principles we
impose on others deny them those options
deny them sovereignty and in the case of
Haiti the one we're talking about unless
we can compel the imperial powers
powerful states to permit the kind of
sovereignty that could do that
out of their own lively functioning
civil society they won't have a chance
and if they have the chance they may not
use a will but if they own end the
chance
they're obviously doomed listening to
you're talking about the narrative of
historical narrative of Haiti we see
cultural and endemic and long-standing
tribalism and racism we see cultural
long-standing endemic feudalism and gaps
between rich and poor that are
institutionalized and now we deal with
an overpowering media using Haiti as an
example what given those things what can
we do either individually or
organizationally to have a significant
impact in changing the direction of the
narrative that previously has been based
on these factors the racism is there and
the cultural attitudes are there and we
know how to deal with them we've dealt
with plenty of them in the recent past
I'm in NASH for example racism is bad
enough but it's nothing like what it was
50 years ago in the United States or
just may take the most dramatic change
that's taken place in the United States
and much of the world culturally in the
last generation name of the woman's
right it's totally different from what
it was 30 or 40 years ago and if I just
think of I'm just make it personal if if
you would ask my grandmother whether she
was oppressed she wouldn't have known
what you were talking about that's just
what women do know if you'd ask my
mother if she would have known and she
was very bitter about it but she didn't
do anything about it because that was
out of the question if you ask my
daughters it's free out of the house
okay that's a change it's a change in
cultural attitudes and we know how it
was done and it's a major change it's a
significant one but you know and the
same has to be true about the other
pathologies that we live with question
is what is Haitian popular organization
we mean people's organization or you
know I don't know what is popular
organization the people in a Soleil
aren't there because they love to live
in misery I mean this whole history that
drove them there at parts of which I
reviewed and they'd be happy to get out
of it and work hard to get out of it as
for the popular organizations just look
at what happened
I mean it's take for example at one
dramatic moment 1990 when organization
popular organization in the slums and
hideous conditions in the rural areas
where life is horrendous with popular
organization reached a point where they
could do something that we can't dream
of namely enter an election elect their
own candidate with two-thirds of the
vote we can't do that they did it we can
learn from them what popular
organizations are
people they're going to take medicines
to Haiti we are giving professor Chomsky
a small gift from the Riverside Church
we had a little discussion do you
believe in God do you can we said it's
not important because what we said we're
giving him a gift that says when you
were born God smiled
