so good morning
my name is eric wishart i'm the vice
president
of the foreign correspondents club and
our journalist with afp
news agency and it's my great honor and
a pleasure this morning
to introduce our very distinguished
speaker
professor noam chomsky um before i hand
the discussion over to uh president judy
schneider
and professor chomsky i'd just like to
remind you of a couple of upcoming zoom
events
um as part of our series of talks
in the fcc on monday we have kishore
mabu bani who's uh azure scholar and
author he'll be talking about his
new book has china one and then we'll be
having a
panel discussion on wednesday uh divorce
decoupling of conflict
sino-american relations and the new
cold war um i know it's a bit of a
cliche to say that our speaker doesn't
need any
introduction but um noam chomsky
has been a reminder and i'm thinking an
intellectual for
for many years he's a laureate professor
in the department of linguistics at the
university of arizona and
professor emeritus at the massachusetts
institute of technology
where he's taught for more than 50 years
he's considered the founder of modern
linguistics one of the most influential
public intellectuals in the world and
he's published on u.s foreign policy
mideast politics
and democratic society it's also written
more than a
100 books several of which i can say
i've purchased
and read so i'm personally delighted to
have
professor chomsky as a speaker this
morning
so um welcome everybody
there is a a function in the chat where
you can
ask questions um so without further ado
i'll pass the microphone to judy
schneider the club
president and senior international
editor at bloomberg news agency judy
thank you
thank you good morning everybody uh and
good
afternoon evening professor chomsky
you're in arizona correct so
we appreciate you uh you taking time out
to talk to us
uh and so i'll get right i'll get
started right away and please do as eric
said um
send over questions and uh we will um
and and if you tell us who you are we
will uh ask professor chomsky your
question
uh with your name uh so uh on july 31st
professor chomsky is the u.s passed
sadly the uh very terrible milestone of
150 000 deaths from the coronavirus now
i think we're up to
about 160 000 in the us uh you were
quoted as saying that you thought
decades of neo-liberal policies had left
the u.s
uh soft social safety net in shambles
and were
at the root of the pandemic can you talk
to us about
that what evidence you see for that and
how far back the u.s should have been
preparing
what do you think could have been done
uh to
prevent or at least to um uh to blunt
what has now been one of the worst
outbreaks and worse worst death tolls
from the pandemic those are
i should start by saying that those are
very appropriate questions
because the same situation is arousing
is arising again right now
in 2003 as you know
the sars epidemic was contained
scientists warned at the time
that it's very likely that another
coronavirus epidemic maybe pandemic
would be coming
told us exactly how to prepare for it
exactly as they're telling us now
with regard to the next likely one
but it's not enough to know the facts
somebody has to make use of them
well the drug companies are the obvious
candidate
huge profits enormous labs but they're
blocked
they're blocked simply by ordinary
capitalist logic
they are profit-making institutions
they want to make profit tomorrow not
prepare
for a possible catastrophe a few years
down the road
which probably won't be very profitable
anyway so they're
out well the government could step in at
enormous laboratories
rich resources actually the
federal government in the united states
does most of the
basic research development for
vaccines and drugs anyway before it
hands the results over to private
corporations
but they're blocked they're blocked by
neoliberalism
you recall ronald reagan's pronouncement
when he took office 40
years ago government is the problem
not the solution that translates as
meaning that
decisions have to be removed from
government
which has the flaw that it's partly
under
popular influence and handed over to
private power which is totally
unaccountable to the public
that's the foundation principle of
neoliberalism
so they're blocked that doesn't mean
that nothing
could be done there were many efforts
despite these impediments
so when president obama came into office
on
in january 2009 the first thing he did
in fact was to call the
presidential science and technology
advisory board
uh convene them first mission to
lay out a program to prepare for a
likely pandemic
they came back a couple weeks later at
the program
he put it into practice
there were some preparations made that
lasted until
january 2017 when donald trump took
office
his first act when he took office was to
dismantle all the preparations
so no preparations left he then
proceeded to
[Music]
terminate programs in which
u.s scientists were working with their
chinese colleagues to try to investigate
potential coronaviruses
and the bat colonies and deep in the
caves and
province and elsewhere they were
dismantled
there were simulations run
as late as october 2019
on the effects of the likely pandemic
that they were ignored
the united states was singularly
unprepared when the pandemic finally
struck
then it got worse the
there were countries mostly in east asia
oceania which responded very quickly
when
china provided the identified the
virus it provided the sequence the
genome prevented presented it to the
world health organization on the world
january 10th
at that point every virologist in the
world knew exactly what was happening
many acted
east asia oceania primarily
europe sort of dithered uh
finally started to react some
fairly effectively except for britain
which was the
outlier much worse off than the others
the united states did nothing reports
kept coming to the white house
from u.s intelligence from health
officials with
no interest the this went on until
mid-march by that time the
stock market was starting to decline
trump noticed that
and began to take some very confused
actions
one thing one day one the next day won't
go through the details
but the united states is basically a
wreck it has
four percent of the world's population
25
of the cases if you look back at late
march
the united states was almost exactly
comparable to europe in number of cases
and deaths
since then the european car curve has
declined very sharply the u.s car
the curve is flat slightly increasing
it's where i live in arizona
as has a governor who's a trump loyalist
so he opened the state much too early
arizona is now vying for the
international record for the highest
number of
cases per capita and similar things are
happening in
different places some places mostly with
democratic governors they're doing
something but there's no national plan
and trump has been flailing around
desperately to
find some scapegoat to cover up for the
fact that
he's responsible for killing
over a hundred thousand americans can't
calculate exactly
so blame china blame the world health
organization
blame the democrats to blame anyone
and that's the situation we're in now in
the united states
there is no progress being made it's
getting worse
would you do now if if you had the power
and
if you could you know talking about all
these things that
um could have been done earlier in terms
of prevention and
way back to when the us uh what the u.s
was supposed to have learned from sars
what would you
do now if they put you in charge of this
if president trump called
you and said noam chomsky i want you to
have the task force which i realize is
unlikely to happen
but um what would you do
well i would do what every other country
just about every other country is doing
the exception of brazil one or two
others
follow the advice of american scientists
now they're giving the advice that's
followed to the whole
by the whole world by the wrong
scientists
so we can certainly do at least what
europe did
if not with south korea taiwan new
zealand did
that much we can do it's necessary right
now to impose a lockdown
not open it prematurely just in order to
foster trump's electoral prospects
which is what's being done the lockdown
can
flatten the curve when it moves there
it's much too late
to do what more advanced countries did
like south korea for example where they
didn't have a lockdown they just did
careful
testing tracing and contacting
so there will localize the epidemic in
particular places
china's doing the same with its
appointed too late for that in the
united states
and probably in britain it's necessary
to have a
full lockdown the federal reserve has
the resources to compensate for the
costs
u.s can print its own currency
virtually without limit still remains
there's no
no inflation a threat remotely in sight
so that's perfectly possible way out and
it'll just have to
wait until the couple weeks the
curve will flatten as it did in europe
then you can begin
slow systematic openings
key to the situation try to make sure
that there's no
major indoor events
one thing that's happening now is that
churches it's a very religious country
churches all over the place
they want to open and bring in people
into the church
the lockdown should prevent that
there are churches suing the government
and the states to try to prevent it uh
young teenage parties have to be
taken stop that can't go on something
has to be done about the colleges
and the schools they're in serious
trouble it can't be opened
just in order to make the country look
good on election day
which is trump's only concern so we
basically know what to do
problem is to do it and then comes the
next step
we can be very confident that another
pandemic is coming
if this is ever resolved
we've been lucky so far so far the
coronaviruses
have either been highly contagious and
not very lethal like this one or highly
lethal
and not very contagious like ebola
we're not guaranteed that next time
might be highly contagious and lethal
we might be facing something like the
black death
we can prepare for it but it has to be
done
uh capitalist logic blocks it
neoliberal assault prevents the
alternative
those have to be dismantled those are
not acts of god
they are human decisions that can be
made differently
but we should realize what we're facing
that isn't done
there'll be another pandemic which
probably much worse than this one
intensified by the impact of global
warming
and habitat destruction which is making
it worse
thank you well we have it we're starting
to get some questions uh
one is on the pandemic um
it is we are approaching three times the
number of debtors died in the vietnam
war
how can americans be made aware of the
seriousness of the pandemic
and um an interesting follow-up question
there and should president trump face
murder or manslaughter charges over his
handling of the pandemic
or i guess mishandling
well it's a very difficult situation
when you have
a government and mass media
trumpeting the same message it's not
serious
don't worry about it it's fake so on
it's very hard to get people organized
so just to give you some
holy results about
if you look at republicans which is it's
a minority party but
almost half the population they are
being told by their revered leader
that it's nothing much don't worry about
it
just like the flu it'll go away
miraculously
don't worry about all these alarmists
they hear that then on trump's echo
chamber
fox news the murdoch cable station
which is about the only source of
information for republicans
fox news just reiterates what trump says
then comes more so there are
all around the world there are crazy
conspiracy theories circulating i'm sure
you've seen them
one of them is that the coronavirus was
started by
the bill gates george soros in order to
control the world's population
about 70 of the american population has
seen that
of republicans about half those who've
seen it over half two-thirds of those
who've seen it believe it
i mean that's what we uh
there there are other media new york
times
cnn washington post uh
half of republicans think call them
the enemy of the people following their
master
about half of republicans think that the
government
meaning trump should have the authority
to close down media if they
carry out bad behavior like producing
fake news which is what they're told
it's a serious problem to deal with
not just on this issue i'll take a much
more serious issue which we can't delay
uh global warming that's not going to go
away
this will be overcome that won't about
uh about 20 of republicans
think that it's a serious problem in
which humans have some role
20 they hear all the time it's just a
left-wing conspiracy well
that makes things difficult requires
major cultural changes and it's being
severely harmed
by the most dangerous political figure
in human history and that is not an
exaggeration
hitler wanted to kill all the jews 30
million slavs
he wasn't trying to destroy organized
human life on earth
which is what trump is racing towards
that's his climate policy let's maximize
the use of fossil fuels
including the most dangerous of them
let's eliminate all the regulations
that mitigate the consequences
and that save americans by restricting
pollution
under the cover of the pandemic these
are being quietly eliminated one after
the other
the investor class understands this
they're very concerned that trump is
declining in the polls
you can read headlines in the major
press
so i think the fossil fuel industry is
localized primarily in texas the texas
press houston chronicle has headlines
which ain't telling us that fossil fuel
companies are extremely concerned
that trump is declining in the polls
they're writing massive
checks to the republicans to ensure that
somehow they can save him
they want to maximize the use of fossil
fuels
out of good capitalist logic that's how
you make money tomorrow
the fate of the world is not their
business
none of this is a law of nature but
that's the way capitalist societies work
i want to ask one more question on uh
related to this and then
uh to move on to some of the things we
are going to i do want to get to some
press issues later so i'm glad to
that you uh they started bringing it up
but this is from eric who is our
our resident fake news expert
um so um as a linguist and cognitive
scientist
what is your analysis of why people turn
to these
fake cures and conspiracy theories which
as you've noted
president trump um seem to sometimes
have a fondness for
why did why are they um turning to these
to find a way through the crisis
and what do you think about the drum
beat of misinformation
from the white house on down about the
pandemic
well that's part of the answer to your
question
people are angry frightened
desperate this is actually pre-trump
40 years of neoliberalism have left
the victims of this assault
angry resentful uh isolated
contemptuous of government it's in
europe
it's in the united states see it
everywhere
that's fertile territory for demagogues
you can see
i can save you follow me it's also
fertile territory for conspiracy
theories now people want some
understanding of what's happening
but they're not getting it from the
media they're not getting it from the
intellectual classes certainly not
getting it from the government
so they search around for something that
will explain it
why is this happening to us you know
that's the kind of situation in which
you do get conspiracy theories this has
happened with
every major plague in history you know
let's kill the jews let's
uh do something somebody's
responsible i didn't do anything wrong
why is this happening to me
so that's pretty natural
it's one of the reasons why people turn
to extremist religions
so maybe uh two-thirds of the population
in the united states
is expecting the second coming of jesus
maybe in their lifetimes okay maybe
that'll save us
when you're living in a intellectual
environment
in which there are no answers no
coherent answers available
you're suffering you don't see why you
turn
to you grasp onto something
incidentally this is not just true in
the united states let me
give you a striking personal example
when one of the things that happens on
the internet
surprised it doesn't happen more than it
does is people put up
fake postings attributed to somebody
happens to me pretty often
there was when the when the pandemic
started somebody
circulated a statement on the
internet attributed to me describing in
detail
how the coronavirus was started in a
u.s government biological laboratory
and then released in order to take over
the whole world
once something's on the internet you
can't do anything about it
you can deny it you can say what you
like but it's there
i started getting letters from all over
the world including
europe including friends and colleagues
educated people
saying thank you for finally telling the
truth
i mean this is all over you know
the united states particularly extreme
examples but it's
happening all over and i think you can
trace a good deal of it to the
effect of neo-liberalism it had a goal
remember
the goal of neo-liberalism was to
transfer
decisions away from the public
to the hands of private power and
to atomize the population
you recall margaret thatcher there's no
society
just individuals tossed out in the
market to
somehow survive for themselves and she
surely didn't know it but she was
paraphrasing karl marx
but he condemned the autocratic rulers
of his
day for trying to turn the public into
what he called
a sack of potatoes just isolated people
who
can't get together can't resist are
subject to authority
in this case it's the authority of
concentrated private power
the first acts first acts that both
thatcher and reagan carried out
was the demolished labor unions first
move both cases reagan went as far as
authorizing uh scabs strike breakers
illegal in every country except at the
time south africa
did it right away the labor unions had
been
smashed in both countries why well
that's one of the very few ways in which
people can organize to protect
themselves
so we've got to get rid of them
eliminate public schools
under but do it by under funding
don't give enough funding so they don't
work then support private schools as an
alternative
all throughout the society eliminate the
means for people to
organize act collectively
make decisions transferred into the
hands of private power
and the results are predictable and
perfectly
perfectly plain so you take a look at
the united states
uh right now 0.1 percent of the
population
not one percent 0.1 percent
of 20 of the wealth that's twice as much
as when reagan took over
the majority of the population get by
from week to week
with nothing left over from one paycheck
to the next
until if anything goes wrong you're in
trouble
there's no universal health system
unlike other countries
that would be people getting together
can't do that
no associations can't protect itself
with unions they're gone
uh so you're you're alone so you get
angry
and resentful uh it's not that the
democrats do that much better
a lot of this is the responsibility of
clinton picked up
and pushed most of the destructive
policies
when obama came in there was
a lot of hope among working people who
were people that something would happen
that nice rhetoric about hope and change
take a look at what happened as he came
in
immediately there was a crash of the
housing market
huge housing bubble because of predatory
actions of
financial institutions let loose by the
clinton administration and deregulation
crashed everybody's wealth was lost led
to a financial crisis
congress passed legislation two
had two parts one part was to bail out
the perpetrators of the crisis the banks
investment firms who had made the
predatory loans we have to bail them out
the other part of the legislation was to
help the people who were victims the
people who'd lost their homes
who'd been foreclosed let's help them
now you can guess which part of the
legislation was enacted
okay that left people pretty angry
by 2010 two years in office
obama and they were already voting
republican
even in massachusetts the most liberal
state people are furious
okay that's uh if this goes on well
okay get it i mean it goes way back and
a lot a lot of history i'm committing
but
this is the recent history is this it's
had very dire effects
i'd like to kind of move on to some
global politics
we've been discussing u.s
largely here um we are obviously sitting
here in hong kong
uh in the center of this potential some
would say
emerging cold war between the u.s and
china on a number of fronts
um as a political activist and dissident
and media watcher and critic how worried
are you about this
how worried are you that this could um
is
more than the saber-rattling uh and
uh and propaganda i would presume you
would call it on both sides
uh and could it be something more and
i'm also going to throw in there
um that um we had a very sad anniversary
in the past day actually it's still
august 6
where you are the 75th anniversary of
the
uh a bomb being dropped on hiroshima and
a few days later on nagasaki
um and you know that's chilling
uh so talk to us about your
uh what you're thinking about the us and
china and and how
uh worried both countries the citizens
of both countries should be about what
could happen
and have we had any lessons in the past
75 years have we learned
anything um from the tragic events of
august uh
on 1945 well i'm
old enough to remember august 6th very
well
um unforgettable memory
and we've been living under that shadow
ever since
as i'm sure you know the every year
the bullet of atomic scientists
convenes a gathering of
scientists political analysts to assess
the world situation
and try to capture it by setting
what's called the doomsday clock how far
is the
minute hand from midnight midnight means
termination when it was set first in
1947 it was
seven minutes to midnight oscillated up
and back
since the worst was 1953
when the united states and the soviet
union
exploded thermonuclear weapons that
told the world that human ingenuity has
now
reached the point where it can wipe out
everything
great success uh the minute hand moved
two minutes to midnight moved around
since
didn't return to two minutes to midnight
until two years ago
every year that trump has been in office
it's moved closer to midnight
two years ago it moved to two minutes to
midnight
this past january the analysts abandoned
minutes
they turned to seconds uh it's now
a hundred seconds to midnight
it's january before the pandemic was
well known they gave three reasons
one is the growing threat of nuclear war
which is increasing uh trump is
dismantling the arms control regime
which
gave some limited protection by now
there's
virtually nothing of it left it's
refusing to
renew the new start treaty which is the
last
remnant uh that's one
the other is the failure to deal
effectively with
the threat of environmental catastrophe
again much of the world is doing
something
sometimes a lot the united states is
almost the only country that's racing in
the opposite direction
under trump not under obama under trump
the disaster one of the
reasons why the texas press is no
reporting that investors are pouring
money into the trump campaign
is that biden under a lot of popular
pressure
has moved towards the most effective
climate policy of practically anyone
it's not enough but it's very good
they hate it so they want trump to get
back in because he's
racing towards maximizing destruction by
fossil fuels
now that's the second the third was
deterioration of democracy
now it sounds at first as if that
doesn't belong
but if you think for a moment it does
because a
vibrant democracy of informed
engaged public the only way to deal with
these major crises
which takes us back to hong kong where
democracies
being undermined by the regional
power china china is trying to
reassert its traditional role
as the dominant force in asia
it's not a imperial power in the western
sense
didn't invade and conquer countries but
it insisted on
they're paying tribute to china you know
the story better than i do
don't run through it trying to
reestablish that position
the united states won't tolerate it the
world
whatever you may learn in your course in
international relations theory
the fact is that the world is run like
the mafia
very similar to the mafia the mafia dawn
the godfather does not tolerate
any interference it doesn't tolerate
states that might challenge it it
doesn't even challenge
small states that get out of line
if you're the godfather and some small
store store keeper
doesn't pay protection money you don't
need the money
but you don't let it go you send in your
goons to
smash them up and destroy this door
that's
international affairs if some small
country
carries at what an official terminology
is called
successful defiance that's government
internal documents referring to cuba in
this case
if a country carries out successful
defiance
has to be stopped that's like the small
storky
that's why the us invaded into china
invaded grenada you know case after case
it's not a new invention the american
revolution was treated the same way
and the great statesmen of europe were
terrified
about the spread of what was called
republican
ideology not today's sense of republic
just not democratic ideology
could undermine the british empire could
undermine authority
civilization and have to stop it that's
the way the world works
okay right now china's a rising power
it's nowhere near the united states way
behind
i mean if you take any dimension you
like
in the military dimension it's not even
worth talking
the united states is the higher military
expenses than about the
10 late lower powers put together
and technologically far more advanced
and russia's way more advanced than
china
but it is increasing far behind but
increasing
it's uh there's economic growth
but it remains a very poor country you
take a look at the
human development index of the united
nations it's ranked around
90s or so has serious internal problems
that the
richer countries don't have it's uh if
you look at world wealth
there's a really outstanding political
economist
in hong kong one of the best in the
world sean stars
teaches in hong kong he's done the major
work
on a very important topic he has a book
coming out on it right now
he's the first person to look carefully
at
a pro a different measure of national
wealth economists usually measure
national wealth by gross domestic
product
which is something but it's not a very
good measure
the stars has looked at something else
i think for the first time how much
will of the world's wealth is in the
hands of
nationally based multinational
corporations
so how much of the world's wealth is
held by
us-based multinationals
the figure is stunning it's about 50
and just about every category
retail manufacturing and finance
the u.s corporations are either first or
sometimes second
china's way behind if you look at
china has grown economically but most of
the wealth that's produced doesn't go to
china
so if you take apple you know apple
phones china
assembles them but the problem most of
the profit goes to fox not
other taiwanese conglomerates that
control it and most of the profit the
great bulk
goes back to apple that's where the
profits go
and apple makes sure that it doesn't
have to pay taxes
by setting up an office in ireland
probably about the size of this room
maybe a secretary comes in every once in
a while
so it's based in ireland now that was
facilitated by reagan
prior to reagan that was illegal reagan
opened the doors we have to have
free markets so it doesn't have to pay
taxes
it makes most of the profit these days
major corporations like apple find it
more
profitable to devote resources
to financial manipulations other than to
research and development that was not
true under steve jobs then they
worked on research and development now
that's declined
under tom cook and they act like most
capitalist corporations moving into
financial markets which
if they have an effect on the economy
it's probably negative
but these are the developments of the
neoliberal system
well going back to the
cold war between china and the united
states
that's a disaster for the world this is
a moment
more than ever we have to have
international cooperation
the crises that we face are all
international all the ones that are
that we've mentioned pandemic is
obviously
international it's uh if a vaccine is
developed it should be a public good
like the salk vaccine for polio 70 years
ago
just given to the public uh the
that's what should be done by a vaccine
today actually china is the one country
that's called for that
they claim i don't know if they're
really gonna do it but they at least
claim
that if a chinese scientists develop a
vaccine they'll
offer free to the public okay that's the
right
stance to take west is taking the
opposite
and trying each country is trying to
maximize
to not even monopolize if possible the
products that can be used for the
remedy in the crisis united states
try to take all the there's one drug
runs into the ear which seems to be a
palliative if they're trying to collect
all of it now they're all trying to make
sure that they control the patents
and they're in the hands of private
corporations which can
gouge they can discharge whatever they
like
because of the rules of the world trade
organization
which is called free trade but it's a
joke
highly protectionist uh
intellectual pro what are called
intellectual property rights are
exorbitant patents have never existed in
history
if they had existed the united states
would never have developed
or other countries but it's a way to
what economists call kicking away the
latter that we borrow technology from
other countries and we block it
the exorbitant patent rights permit the
drugs mostly monopolized by now
under the market conditions that allows
them to charge ridiculous prices
uh way beyond what the drug
or vaccine requires none of this is
necessary again this mostly goes back to
reagan and
the neoliberal years pandemic is an
international problem
countries should be cooperating and
dealing with it
same is true of global warming
the polar ice caps are going to keep
melting
no matter who's at war with each other
and
with all the effects that has nuclear
war is the same
all the countries with nuclear weapons
have to
radically contain them or get rid of
them it's not just
russia and the united states it's the
worst case they have way too many
uh india and pakistan could go to war
over a water crisis that's
the himalayan glaciers milk israel has
a huge store of nuclear weapons
threatened to use
might again that these things could
break out anywhere
the nuclear issue is an international
issue
the global warming is an international
issue
pandemic obviously is
there has to be cooperation on these
things
allowing conflict to develop is first of
all unnecessary
and secondly catastrophic now right now
the united states is
um there are confrontations between
china and the united states
but they're not off the coast of the of
california
they're not in the caribbean and they're
off the coast of china
china's doing things it shouldn't be
doing there it's doing there what the
united states does
over most of the world shouldn't be
doing it
but that confrontation has to be dealt
with by
negotiation and diplomacy there's no way
to do it by force unless we want to all
destroy ourselves
and the same is true of other
confrontations
uh the united st
the united states is quite open publicly
in fact
publicly trying to prevent china from
developing
that's not only cruel but senseless
if china develops it's to everybody's
benefit
if china manages to develop the best
solar panels in the world
we all benefit china happens to develop
a vaccine
we all benefit and reciprocally
that's the way things ought to work now
they can
but not if leaders are pursuing their
own
interests of power prestige
and insisting on creating crises where
they don't have to exist
um i wanted to ask about hong kong we
have several good questions on that i'm
going to combine them
uh one is from um florence de shanje
who's our our former president of the
club
who's asking um what do you think of the
open support that the u.s
has brought to uh the hong kong
protesters and how has that influenced
what's been happening here also from
angel kwan with apple daily one of the
bigger news organizations here in hong
kong uh
how will hong kong likely be affected
under the increasing tension between the
us and china
and after the new national security law
has been imposed how do you foresee the
future of hong kong
obviously this is a of major interest to
all of us sitting here
uh including uh those of us within the
forum correspondence club who
who are covering this well it's
always worth remembering the
old saying that when the
elephants fight the grass gets trampled
hong kong's the grass
if the elephants start fighting hong
kong's lost
uh hong kong taiwan
other countries in the chinese periphery
vietnam have
much to lose if the confrontation
continues
it's in their enormous interest to see
it resolved by
diplomacy negotiations and same
policies there's
the pressure on hong kong to
undermine its democratic
procedures and practices and
opportunities is
wrong nefarious anything should
that's possible should be done to
prevent it but force isn't going to
prevent it
the only thing that'll ease
these measures is a
reduction in international tensions
which is the one factor that can bring
china to reducing repression
that's not only china and hong kong
i'll take a much older one take say the
united states and cuba
cuba gained its independence in uh
19 december uh 1959
60 years ago within months
the united states planes were bombing
cuba from u.s territory
a couple months later there was a formal
decision in the government to overthrow
the government of cuba
that was eisenhower kennedy came in
invaded invasion failed
then launched a major terror campaign
very substantial terror campaign to
bring
the terrors of the earth to cuba that's
the way it was described internally
to try to force cuba to
overthrow its government that went on
that's what helped bring on the missile
crisis
the cuban missile crisis part of the
reason is to protect against it
almost destroyed the world terror
continued
has been a economic strangulation
there's a small poor country off the
coast of the major superpower
economic strangulation extremely severe
when the united states imposes
economic warfare it's third
party warfare it's against everybody
else too
nobody's allowed to violate u.s
sanctions if they do they get thrown out
of the international financial system
go back to the mafia so europe doesn't
like the sanctions but they observe
they have to in fact we know the world
opinion on this
comes up in the united nations every
year general assembly
security council use just eat this
everything comes up in the general
assembly
the vote is unanimous literally
against the u.s embargo one exception
israel votes with the united states
because it has to
it's a client but as it barely even gets
reported in the united states
doesn't matter we do what we like and
the official reason
i started quoting it goes back to the
kennedy years is
internal documents declassified uh
cuba's successful defiance of u.s
policies
that go back 150 years
that means to the monroe doctrine 1823
in which president monroe declared
the u.s policy of
basically ruling the western hemisphere
couldn't implement it at that time
britain was too powerful over the years
it was basically implemented
cuba is defying it can't have that have
to destroy them
i can mention much else in the world but
these are the kinds of things
cuba hong kong not being
oppressed to that extent but it's bad
enough but these things have to stop
but they can be done in the case of a
powerful state like the united states
the world can't do a thing
has to come from within and can't come
from within unless people at least know
about what i've just said
probably defined one in a thousand
americans
ever heard all we know is cuba is
somehow bad
can't believe but it has to come from
within
and for countries like hong kong
it's going to have to come from
reduction of international tensions
which can bring about relaxation on the
part of
chinese efforts to establish their uh
asian hegemony if there's another way
i've
never heard of it
do you see any uh signs of optimism
anything
where you go okay this is going in the
right direction
i know this is different than the
doomsday
over the clock the hong kong protests
for example
were a major site of optimism i mean
you know they didn't totally succeed but
they laid the seeds for
future progress uh take the united
states right now
the biggest social movement in american
history
developed quickly suddenly
right after the murder of george floyd
enormous popular movement all over
that has overwhelming popular support
about two-thirds of the public supports
it
nothing like that for social movements
ever
not way beyond what martin luther king
achieved at the peak of the civil rights
movement
and it's very serious movement a lot of
solidarity
black weight solidarity uh trump is
trying to crush it
sent federal truth he sent troops to
portland
i read about that notice not federal
troops
he didn't send the army and there's a
reason for that
the army probably would have disobeyed
when he tried to use the army
in washington to disperse protesters
the military command we threw them he
doesn't
have total control over the army so what
he sent was basically paramilitaries
the groups that he sent were tactical
uh units it's a group called bortak
i know it very well because it operates
a few miles from where i live
i live in arizona not that far north
from the
border and the border very harsh desert
uh refugees are fleeing and misery
from the destruction of their countries
by the united states
mainly gradient but also following
the border patrol cortex
tactical unit are free to do anything
they want
they're unsupervised their orders are to
attack and disperse
the refugees somebody leaves a bottle of
water for them
smash it up so they don't get it a
couple of days after
portland it probably wasn't reported
in hong kong but after trump
was compelled to withdraw the
paramilitaries from portland
the paramilitaries in portland had to
face first of all white people
and then women the portland moms they
were called
the women who lined up and said we don't
want you to invade our city
that's not good publicity sending
paramilitaries to attack
middle-class women so they withdrew the
powers from there but they continued to
work south of the border
two days later two days after the they
were withdrawn from portland
right south of where i live they
attacked a
humanitarian aid center it was set up in
the desert
to provide medical aid
false water to refugees who were able to
straggle in if they were able to survive
the desert 100 degrees fahrenheit
degrees heat
very harsh vision so they entered that
with a big show of force
armored vehicles come in and
tie up the hands of all the medical
workers and disperse the refugees
and take them into custody and take them
out of the beds
that's vortech you couldn't do that
importantly but they can do it here
well these things can be stopped like in
the
town where i live tucson arizona in a
pretty conservative town conservative
state
uh the humanitarian aid workers have
tremendous support
you see on some signs on all the lawns
la la land saying uh humanitarian aid is
not a crime
uh when they've been brought up for
federal charges
for crimes like uh leaving bottles of
water in the
desert helping a refugee who makes its
way to your
cabin felony and be in jail for 20 years
when they come up for crimes they're
released by juries
juries won't convict them local people
so if you want to ask about optimism yes
plenty of signs
and we have time for just a quick
question um
and so i'm going to ask what you're
reading what should we
give us a couple book recommendations we
had the pan america
uh ceo on the other day and she gave us
some good ones uh
so um what should we be reading
we have we have a little bit more time
on our hands these days
i'm asked that all the time and i can
never answer
too many options too many dimensions
give us a couple
individual interesting concerns i have
huge piles of books all around me i
don't know probably can't see them
that's the urgent reading you're not
seeing
so i don't know depends what you're
interested in
well name one of your books that you
would recommend you've be what have
written more than hundreds that were 100
or so so
uh name was a book that uh particularly
us in the media
would be uh would be interested in for
our list this summer
the media had a couple of books
specifically on the media one is
called manufacturing consent it's
written
with a late friend edward hermann died a
couple years ago there's another
one called necessary illusions which is
a kind of a follow-up to it
but there's some small path
more readable pamphlets like
forget the names of them a couple of
them around
but they're
they're a couple years old but it's
pretty much the same story
but the media now it's very scary
i mean when half of republicans think
that the government should have the
right to close down media if it doesn't
like them that's dangerous
well thank you i wanted to thank
professor chomsky for this wide-ranging
talk
it will be on the uh soon it will be on
our website
at fcchk.org and post it on youtube i
also want to thank everybody who sent in
questions
we had a lot of them and we sorry we
couldn't get to them all but
maybe we can invite professor chomsky to
join us again and we'll uh
we'll get to some of those other
questions so thank you very much
uh stay safe and uh again thank you all
and thank you all for
attending our zoom event
it's my pleasure bye bye
