we are going to discuss trident
austerity this afternoon where you are
in this evening where we are the first
question is if the UK existed without
trident would it be able to defend us
permanent possession on the UN Security
Council and do you think that any of the
form of the p5 may invite our appraisal
or removal of veto privileges if the UK
didn't have trident would they be able
to defend this pair permanent position
on a UN Security Council oh sure so it's
irrelevant I mean it can maintain its
position is solid stable nothing's
taking it away if any country that gave
up nuclear weapons would be even in a
stronger position because after all all
states with nuclear weapons are
obligated by law under the ruling of the
International Court of Justice to
observe article 6 of the
non-proliferation treaty and to make
good faith efforts to eliminate their
nuclear weapons now what do you think
consequences and impact would be in a UK
and the broader global community if the
UK was to divest itself of Trident I
think it would be it's safer world and
it might be an incentive to the other
nuclear powers including the United
States and Russia each of which has
about 4,500 there are five thousand
nuclear weapons whereas maybe 100 that
could destroy the world might be an
incentive to them to not only to end
their programs of modernizing expanding
their nuclear weapon system as both are
doing but also to divest themselves of
them and it's also important to remember
that there are three countries that have
not even signed nuclear powers that have
not signed the non-proliferation treaty
india pakistan and israel and that's
very serious the non-political it's very
dangerous
the Pakistan is probably the most
dangerous country in the world there's a
not small possibility that Pakistani
nuclear weapons could leak to jihadi
elements Pakistani nuclear scientists
are quite concerned about that Israel's
yesterday at the Security Council the
the Prime Minister of the Iran pointed
out quite accurately that Israel's
nuclear weapons are the single
impediment to imprinting about a nuclear
free weapons own in the Middle East
region which would be extremely
important that's been on the agenda
since 1995 and in fact continuation
perpetuation of the non-proliferation
treaty is conditional on progress made
towards establishing a nuclear weapons
free zone in the region so the inability
to do this it might even prejudice the
the non-proliferation treaty itself it's
the United States has been blocking it
regularly at the regular five-year
review meetings of the NPT Obama blocked
it in 2005 the Bush administration
refused even to attend in 2010 Obama
blocked it a couple of months ago 2015
Obama blocked it again and as understood
internationally I mean obvious and said
this is at the behest of the country
which refuses to even sign the
proliferation treaty namely Israel so
these are very serious issues well my
are your thoughts on Eddie Corbin and
it's anti-austerity and movement I think
he's absolutely right austerity is even
the International Monetary Fund
economists have recognized that
austerity in a period of recession is an
economically absurd proposal
many mainstream American economists are
kind of shocked that the reactionary and
the ignorant character of the economic
programs that Europe is following of
imposing austerity it's had very harmful
can defect saz predicted in England as
well and I think Corbin is quite right
and in fact pretty much in the
mainstream in this respect in opposing
these policies the same with his
opposition to trident didn't get through
the Labour Party but i think his
position on eliminating trident makes
perfect sense he's suggesting that
britain should become a law-abiding
country it should live up to its
obligations under the non-proliferation
treaty oracle six again and in fact i
think it would improve British security
and also the security of the world other
powers should follow suit and
interestingly am the Labour Party
conference where Jeremy Corbyn was
speaking today at the Labour Party
conference and their Trident seems
pretty much off of the agenda for the
Labour Party after three months of
jeremy corbyn campaigning on this
trident ed the removal of trident kind
of rhetoric well i heard that report i
think it's unfortunate and i hope he
continues with his campaign and we'll be
able to gain greater support for it not
only in England but generally reduction
of nuclear weapons is a prime concern
for people who care about the future of
the human species you look at the record
of the past 70 years it's a miracle that
we survived literally we've come very
close to a terminal nuclear war
repeatedly sometimes by accident sheer
accident and that happens over and over
in frightening ways when you look at the
details sometimes by just adventurism of
leaders who haven't understood what
either cared about or understood what
they're doing the the chances that this
miracle will persist indefinitely are
not high and recently yanis varoufakis m
was on a BBC program um and his argument
for austerity was that the austerity the
grease is suffering is much much greater
than UK and in fact George Osborne the
UK's the Chancellor isn't actually
imposing austerity on the UK he's
imposing a class war to quote yanis
varoufakis the austerity that the UK is
suffering is this it's not even worthy
of the wart if you like are you going to
comments alone I think you can make a
cake I don't think you can make a
economic case for the austerity programs
as I say even the IMF economists don't
believe it and they've published reports
explaining why and again pretty
mainstream American economists are
appalled by these programs and if you
ask what their consequences are well the
consequences are for Greece it's been an
utter disaster I mean can hardly even be
questioned the so-called bailouts
degrees are overwhelmingly bailouts to
the banks that lent money to Greece when
they should have done so on elementary
considerations that being essentially
bailed out for their irresponsible
behavior them not much of the money is
going to greece and in fact reasoning
well has suffered very severely very
high unemployment the alleged purpose of
the bailouts was to reduce Greece's debt
which has increased
the GDP because GDP has declined so far
so fast I mean actually Greece was
making some progress and dealing with
improving GDP eliminating a problems in
the economy but it's destroyed by the
austerity programs and it has similar
effects in most other places as
economists have understood for a long
time it does have the effect of
undermining social democratic policies
and I think it makes some sense to think
of it as purposeful or not a kind of
class war continued on for that one of
the things that I've been watching very
closely is the actual actions of the IMF
and the actions that the Central
European Bank IE the way that German
private German companies of the strode
into Greece and strip the Greece of all
their public sectors if you like you
know the the public you know the
railways for example you know about the
railways in the UK are publicly publicly
owned and what concerns me is awaited
Germany is stripped Greece of the public
assets well your Germany follows a I
mean is this on the first point there's
a split between the economist's of the
IMF and the policies of the IMF the
economists have published a judicious
careful studies highly critical of the
austerity programs meanwhile the
policies of the IMF is part of the Troy
car supporting them as far as the why
the the German banks and Germany in
general follows a policy called the Ord
liberalism we should have a policy of
liberalism according market principles
but according to a fixed set of rules
and that set of rules is not you can
argue about whether it's good for
Germany or not but it's certainly not
good for the European Union given the
komplex the disparity of in the
economy's country is the inability of
the countries within the eurozone to
make use of the normal procedures for
dealing with financial problems namely
devalue their currencies all of the
normal measures are blocked and
following these rigid principles along
with the extreme demands for a low
inflation in fact very low inflation
even well below the the official target
those make no sense economically force
socially they can only be regarded as a
device for undermining growth and
undermining social welfare programs I
mean it's pretty shocking tick written
to see Britain contemplating and
initiating a an effort to turn the
National Health Service probably the
best service in the world into something
like the American system which is the
worst system in the world it's shocking
it's take a look at the programs of the
u.s. system which is heavily privatized
and therefore extremely inefficient
costly of bureaucratic this is a it's
about twice the per capita costs of
other comparable countries and some of
the worst outcomes and very hard to live
with because of the complex the enormous
complex the imposed by the privatization
system so to try to take the best
probably the best sister in the world
NHS and to turn it into the worst system
of the world that it really have to ask
yourself what's motivating the
bureaucrats and political figures who
could even entertain such thoughts I
think many of us in Scotland and feel
equally as indignant with regards to the
way the UK's NHS has been handled and
people in Scotland
very very upset with devic armaanon and
as I believe Scotland as a element of
control over how much it spends on NHS
in Scotland and but as a result last
year we tried to become independent
which you're probably aware of and I
read some time ago that you were not a
nationalist but you believed in
devolution marks as your possession
changed at all nah well I think my
position on that was that I don't pay to
position it's a very it's a question
that has quite significant consequences
and I haven't studied it in depth and to
take a position on an issue of that
significance without studying it in
depth would be quite a responsible I can
understand the sentiment kind of
intuitively in favor of it but that's
not enough to justify taking a definite
position so it's understandable i think
the last election which is quite often
misrepresented in the press and it's the
way it's described is that labour lost
decisively because ed miliband made a
slight move to the left in fact just
take a look at the facts it's quite
different the first of all milla been in
a very small move to the left and that
increased the vote of the Labour Party
in England it increased it he lost
Scotland but that's because he didn't
move far enough to the left so the
conclusions from the election are pretty
much the opposite of what's regularly
claimed and Corbin if Corbin can survive
the huge assault against him which is
pretty remarkable to watch not just from
the right but particularly from the
Labour establishment the kind of Blair
right establishment it's a shocking
most hysterical propaganda campaign
being launched against him with all kind
of absurd charges whether he can
withstand that I don't know that if he
does I think it could be a breath of
fresh air for the UK all together and
the policies is talk suggesting i think
by and large make pretty good sense and
again and i can only hope that he can
withstand the assault do you think and
jeremy corbyn can move in on the kind of
left the the nationalist left there the
SMP picked up 56 seats at the general
election of a possible 59 and do you
think jeremy corbyn can claw any of
those back well I think if Corbin can
carry through the kinds of programs he's
discussing and in fact to which he's
been committed all of his political life
he's not making any significant changes
that i can see if he can pursue these it
might be a way of accommodating Scotland
within the federal system maybe I think
if that happens it would be a salutary
development I shall keep you any longer
it's been absolutely fantastic speaking
to you well I'll be with you yep is this
thank you so much like it
