thank you for coming I'm Karen mal Peeta
and I wrote and directed the play
prophecy and that's not why I said that
just so you know who I was because it's
really my profound pleasure to introduce
professor Noam Chomsky author teacher
linguist preeminent intellectual and
moral voice of our time Noam Chomsky
knows more about the causes and effects
of American imperialism than any other
person alive and certainly far more than
anyone in the government so right now
when we need someone capable of cutting
through the camp and speaking truth to
power we are graced with his fierce and
rigorous and gentle voice and I
particularly want to thank gnome for his
generosity in supporting theater three
collaborative a little tiny theater
trying to put on a play about the
effects of war that no established
theater in this country dared to produce
when I wrote down the story of how we
realized that we would have to do the
play ourselves
he answered why am I not surprised and
he agreed to help it's always been my
dream of the theater become again a
vital part of the intellectual life of
its time and it's a very great honor for
the theater as a whole - welcome Noam
Chomsky to the stage tonight
this does this work yeah okay well I'm
glad that we moved to a different
auditorium frankly I thought I could
shake off a little bit the emotions and
the memories that were brought up by the
performance a little bit not too much
one thing that couldn't help coming to
my mind as I was watching it that I
don't want to spend time on personal
things but I've had about 75 years of
consciousness of the outside world and I
don't think there's been a moment well
at least in the background and often
obsessively in the foreground it was the
thought that you got to do something to
stop this horrific war too many of them
to mention and they're going to go on
and they're going to go on we can see
them develop right in front of our eyes
unless we do something about it I'll say
a couple of words about that and then
turn to you see what's on your minds I
just have move come back from Lebanon a
couple of days ago it said I was there
for years exactly four years ago with my
wife we traveled through southern
Lebanon at lots of people we were
graciously welcomed homes we gave me I
gave talks I thought
little saw the country it was a moment
of real hope it's had a terrible history
but that was a moment of great
hopefulness and aspiration for a better
future a couple of weeks after we left
the place was leveled that was the
us-israeli war that they operate attend
the us-israeli war which essentially
leveled the southern part of the country
this time of course I went back to try
to see the places where we had been
where the places where we had been
welcomed people we had met some of them
now murder
places like Nantucket and southern in
southern South Beirut which was
literally little that's the famous stuff
yet doctrine that Israeli general
proposed for Gaza couple years later
it's a lot of it's been rebuilt
amazingly rebuilt there's still a spirit
of courage and determination but my
sense is of more grimness than there was
before because of an expectation that
it's going to happen again
and it might I spoke to knowledge of
quake I don't want to mention any names
with very knowledgeable journalists
who've been in the region for decades
and are convinced that there's a
there's a Israel because the law were
coming maybe soon and in that and this
kit will presumably be part of an
Israeli attack on Iran if it happens if
it does this time it will be an error an
all-out air war which will probably
destroy all of Lebanon and Hezbollah
seems to believe and those who know
about it seem to take them seriously
they could that they have now the
capacity to devastate a good part of
Israel so maybe they'll succeed in the
stranger or something like it and it
could be in it and it could be part of a
much worse for the involving Iran or
even beyond how in an it is we don't
really know so for example Iran has
announced as you may have seen that they
would send ships to Gaza to join the
efforts to break the blockade if that
happens you know it's finished might
turn into a nuclear war which could
spread without limits the we have a
president named Barack Obama if you take
a look at his website I don't know if
it's still there the website that he had
he put up in his primary campaign
explaining his policies and goals and so
on there's actually the word 11 and his
mentioned once
it's full of a few civ love for Israel
of course but the word Lebanon is
mentioned once namely he took pride in
the fact that as a senator one of the
few things that he did was to co-sponsor
a resolution in June 2006 a resolution
which insisted that nothing be done to
prevent Israel from achieving its
maximal goals in its invasion of Lebanon
and that Iran and Syria should be
punished for helping defend Lebanon from
its attackers the I gave of course Fox
and Lebanon one of them was on May 25th
the May 25th I didn't know this is
happens to be a Lebanon Liberation Day
it's the one national holiday and eleven
schools are closed businesses closed
what's it about
well it's about the fact that in the
year 2000 the guerrillas Hezbollah
primarily had finally succeeded in
driving Israel out of southern Lebanon
where it had been holding territory for
22 years in violation of Security
Council orders with plenty of atrocities
and massacres actually included a number
of invasions including all of the
Israeli figures who are regarded as
heroic does Shimon Peres say it's a
Caribbean others but they finally left
and withdrew in the year 2000 so this
happened to be the 10th anniversary of
the national holiday Liberation Day if
you read the press coverage in Israel
today it's full of articles by military
figures other officials the France Nana
Moshe are describing how they made a
mistake by withdrawing from Lebanon
because now because all that is has not
been on focus as well now Iran it is
able to renew its aggression against
Israel in southern Lebanon in other
words what they were doing in southern
load and driving a guerrilla war against
Israel is aggression against Israel by
Iran and that's accepted in the United
States you won't know about the flotilla
you know that there's Raley helicopters
flew over the boats but commandos down
from where'd the helicopters come from
well from your pockets if you're paying
if your taxpayers Israel doesn't
manufacture helicopters we give them the
helicopters with the purpose of carrying
out war crimes and that's not a joke
and just to give one example in the
first month of the in September 2000
just about the time that Israel withdrew
from Lebanon finally in September 2000
the the Second Intifada broke out the
first month of it was September it was
right after Ariel Sharon had gone on
that famous visit
the region of the Temple Mount very
provocative and then the next day he
would Barack sent a big military force
which killed a lot of you then it broke
out in that first month September there
were 70 Palestinians killed and four
Israeli soldiers the usual ratio if you
go back to the press reports you'll find
that the Israel Israel was using
helicopters meaning American helicopters
to attack the civilian targets like
apartment complexes killing dozens of
people it was reported what was not
reported however and to this day is
barely known is that just as those
reports were coming out about us
helicopters being used to attack sit-in
complexes Bill Clinton made sent made a
deal to send the biggest consignment of
helicopters to Israel ever or at least a
decade Black Hawk helicopters and spare
parts for Apache helicopters the attack
helicopters I cannot write at the time
that the news reports were coming out
about using them to attack civilian
complexes wasn't a secret you could read
me it's really fresh you could read it
in the military journals Jane's Defence
weekly read in the European press
Amnesty International had a report about
it condemning it not a word in the US
press actually one word one small
newspaper and
Genya had a reference to it it wasn't
that it was known as all over the wire
services editors were in fact approached
Tasnim what if I don't run well you know
that's the kind of contribution that we
make to these atrocities and will
continue to Obama's one of the more
extreme disrespect as the example I just
mentioned well if that comes that's one
major war that may come pretty soon
maybe is likely to come it's not the
only one the one that's more likely in
fact is imminent any day now is an
attack on Kandahar in Afghanistan second
largest city in Afghanistan it's been
announced it's not secret that the next
major attack in Afghanistan is going to
be on kondeh heart well the US Army has
published taken polls and published them
so you can read them in the American
press of opinion in Kandahar that's
about 95 percent opposed to a military
action 19 to 1 by the tribal elders have
met apart from coal the same percentage
say we don't want military action
against our Afghan brothers referring to
the Taliban
okay that's the next one that's coming
you can guess what that smell looked
like the last attack were widely
reported heralded a great victory was an
attack on Marg Omar Joseph town small
pal
Helmand province for most of the
insurgency is in the question areas
Marja was finally conquered after a
couple of days of pretty bitter fighting
as you may have seen a few days after
that the commander I think Lieutenant
General or something forgot his name had
an interview in the press which he said
we've got to revise our notion of enemy
he said we were thinking we were going
to drive the enemy out of Marjoe but now
we understand that the people of Marjoe
support the enemy so we can't we've got
to recalibrate and think some other way
of talking about who the enemy is
this is very reminiscent of earlier the
counterinsurgency wars in fact you could
have read the same in Pravda the 1980s
and you could have read the same in the
United States in the 1960s where it was
written so for example in most of in
1965 the leading US government scholar
that does fight I wrote a book about the
Vietcong Viet Cong is a derogatory term
invented by US propaganda for the
National Liberation Front the southern
resistance and he described how
difficult the US goals are going to be
in South Vietnam he said the problem we
face is that the Vietcong are a man are
the only masked based political force in
South Vietnam and to try to confront
them say by political means would be
like a minnow in front
well our clients being the minnow of
them being the whale so therefore the
only thing we can do is to reconstruct
reconstruct the war so that it's not the
kind they want a political war but it's
the kind we're good at a military war so
we prefer our comparative advantage
which is violence and we have to do that
because there's no other way to for a
minnow to deal with the whale and in
fact that's the main principle of the
famous coin as it's now called
counterinsurgency doctrine which is you
know the wonderful new theory that we're
supposed to be dedicated to and yeah if
you're fighting wars in other people's
countries you've constantly faced with
that so it's not the United States that
invented it they're the Russians the
British who told you the same thing the
French the Germans in fact as far back
as you go the Romans were the Greeks
well that's the prospect we're looking
footpad and for whatever years I have
left I don't expect them to be different
from the past 75 of consciousness unless
something very significant happens you
at least a willingness to face the
reality of these of these actions stop
their turn to you so if you would like
to ask a question or say something raise
your hand and you'll get our microphone
- Barack Obama is erected on electric
for a second term to see him go more to
the right
the right yes hard to know I take say
George Bush Bush's second term was
considerably more centrist than his
first term first term was abrasive
aggressive reason I mean he basically
literally he and Colin Powell and the
rest told Europeans literally you either
do what we say or you're irrelevant and
don't care about you we make history was
one of their famous words we don't care
you guys the reporters you can report
history who we make it and they went
ahead and made like in Iraq for example
that term dropped us prestige to its
lowest point in history us became one of
the most hated countries in the world on
feared countries in the world and it led
to quite considerable internal criticism
right within the establishment the
second Bush term move was more moderate
more toward the center they kicked out
some of the most outlandish figures
Rumsfeld Wolfowitz a couple others
couldn't get rid of Dick Cheney because
he basically was the administration the
other thing a lot of the others went and
it was more of a familiar kind of what
we call centrist administration and
Obama is pretty much following the
policies of the second Bush
administration what he would do in the
next term if he
another term I don't know how to predict
depends on word the world situation you
just can't tell
I mean takes a Kennedy though there's a
lot of propaganda is what it amounts to
about how if Kennedy had been had not
been assassinated all the kind of
wonderful things would happen he was
planning this that Anil he was going to
get us out of Vietnam he was going to
make peace in the world and so on are
the evidence for that is Europe I'm in
on Vietnam for example there's a massive
evidence and what it shows is he was
sort of it toward a hawkish in the
administration I'm he was willing to
tolerate McNamara's proposals for slow
withdrawal from Vietnam but always with
a qualification after victory never
departed from that so yeah after victory
and in fact the people in his
administration like McNamara were the
most committed to withdrawal we know
what they did when the situation change
after there was a kind of period of
optimism about victory in 1963 but 1964
was clear that that was a fantasy
so then war then we get to that was
quite and the policies that went along
with it and I'm the slightest reason to
doubt that Kennedy would have done the
same thing and you know the political
leaders operated within a pretty narrow
framework which is set by external
factors power systems of various kind
domestic concentration of economic power
and they there's a difference between
them they're not identical but I don't
think that these differences are very
predictable so for example in many ways
Richard Nixon was the last liberal
president that's literally true look as
policies I'd like to ask you what you
see whether the Liem financial crisis
has had any effect on the level of
aggressiveness of the Obama
administration it's going to have to
have some effect look at the famous
Deborah noun you know the current
propaganda is we have to be obsessed
with the deficit okay that's coming from
people I create Peter Peterson it's to
another server
you know just dying to get rid of Social
Security another benefits date so we
have to concentrate on the deficit
actually it's pretty dumb idea you
should have a deficit during a recession
we should have a bigger deficit to
stimulate growth and so on but put that
aside
what's the deficit take a look at it
about half the deficit is military
spending which is going up under Obama
in fact it's the most military spending
of any president his first term not
relative to GDP but absolutely well
that's roughly half the deficit so the
famous don't deal with the deficit
they're going to be signed with that and
of course that would mean cutting back
on adventurism overseas the United
States is spending approximately as much
on the military as the rest of the world
combined and it's technologically far
more advanced and going into areas that
other countries can dream about an
infected
to prevent like state you know were
using space for military purposes and
there's all kind of other grotesque
ideas on the drawing work like take
drones which are the exciting new
technology there are now plans for
developing drones with nanotechnology
which allows a lot theoretically a lot
more flexibility and having them range
from you know massive drones which in
carry out vast destruction to drones for
targeted assassinations which has just
been condemned by Phillip all spoons one
believing specialist on international
human rights a Down to drones which can
get if you can live in and kill
particular tiny drones that will be able
to penetrate small living spaces and
kill people suspected of this that or
the other thing well you know all of
this is extremely expensive and that's
plus the eight hundred or so military
bases around the world and the Obama
administration is very much committed to
those I'm they practically overthrew the
government of Japan just recently it's
big country because the the Prime
Minister of Japan had been elected on a
campaign promise to
to close down the military base in
Okinawa the people of Okinawa have been
struggling to get that base out of there
for decades and the Japanese government
finally agreed to try to do it but the
Obama administration put its foot down
with a major power play and a hottie on
either join you know that's an
indication of how power works and what
the plans are so yeah if they're if
there's going to be any effort to deal
with the growing deficit serious effort
that's what it will have to concentrate
on that's not going to Obama has a
commission as you know that is supposed
to deal with the deficit but there's
every likelihood that that commission if
you just took a look at the way it's
constituted is going to go after
benefits like Social Security which
isn't the economic problem at all
there's hated by a leech they've been
trying to get rid of it for years
although it's pretty good shape and
fiscally so they're going to go after
that you're gonna have to go after
Medicare benefits and so on but nobody's
talking about doing anything about the
military which keeps expanding but you
know that's going to be a constraint
that someone you know you can't go on
like that forever actually the other
half of the deficit is mostly medical
expenses due to the completely
dysfunctional US medical system which
has not been improved in this most
dysfunctional aspect by Obama's health
care reform both to reform at of
things in it but it didn't touch the
main part which is the incredible
expense of the system that's about twice
the per capita expense of other of
comparable countries and outcomes are
down toward the bottom so for example a
maternal a Monsieur national just put
out a report on maternal deaths deaths
during childbirth the United States is
worse than Greece you know I mean it's
despite twice as high per capita
expenses of anybody one of the these
studies global surveys it compared many
countries among them Cuba in the United
States the Cuba has approximately the
same health outcomes as the United
States at five percent of the expense
per capita well none of this is touched
in Obama's health care reform and we
have this is the only country in the
world where as far as I know where the
government is barred by law from
negotiating drug prices they can do it
the Veterans Administration so their
prices are sort of reasonable but they
pick Medicare can't do it
so of course drug prices are you know
two or three times as high as anywhere
else Obama insisted on that he made a
promise to the drug companies that that
wouldn't be touched over the objection
of eighty five percent of the population
according to polls at the time
that's not touch the private privatized
insurer and virtually unregulated
insurance basis for the system is
extremely expensive and that's not
touched in fact as you know Obama
killed even the public option over the
objection of probably two-thirds of
so these things are just you know that's
holy territory financial institutions
are far too powerful to in dominating
the government for there to be any real
progress on this unless we move towards
a functioning democracy but but with the
point you make is correct there's there
is a conflict coming up between
financial crisis which is our state's
not going away
unemployment is going to be very high
for a while it's not just a financial
crisis it's a general economic crisis
unemployment is extremely high no
indication that it's going to reduce in
fact you know the economists are now
recalculating what's holding natural
rate of unemployment and they're
calculating it up some are getting it as
high as seven and a half percent that
means that should be normal unemployment
not too far from the official figures
now in manufacturing industry where
likelihood the jobs will come back is
very slight unemployment about the level
of the Great Depression so these
problems are there and how that's going
to be combined with global war global
warfare commitment expanding massive
global warfare commitment that's not
obvious I would you mentioned a very
critical example of how the media
largely fails to report on things like
this and I would like to ask you that to
what extent you think the internet might
change that picture for the better but
more importantly as we just saw this
great theater piece to what extent using
art in general and theater in particular
is doing the better job in reflecting
critically on these things
we just saw is a good example how
effective it is I mean a lot of people
are putting out a lot of energy and
effort into it it hasn't been enough to
turn things around as I said I've been
through seventy-five conscious years and
had there been games you know things
have been done but not enough to end the
fact that we're in a permanence that
there there's a permanent state of war
going on in the world sometimes it's not
us sometimes we're not directly involved
so for example right now the probably
the worst atrocities in the world are in
eastern Congo and nobody talks about
that we talk about Darfur which is bad
enough because there you can blame it on
Arabs so okay that's good coughing
eastern Congo unfortunately have to
blame it on everyone us-ally and on
multinational corporations which are
hiring the militias that are destroying
the place and/or so that people like us
can have cold pain and our cellphones
and other such things so we don't talk
about those though maybe five many
people have been killed there in the
last couple of years and there are
things like that happening all over and
all too often were directly involved so
has it been enough well obviously not
has it been something yes it certainly
has for example the Iraq war horrible as
it was was nothing like the Vietnam War
night close and large part of the reason
was this is too much inter
resistance here in the case of the
Vietnam War there was always no internal
resistance if you think about it there
was finally a strong anti-war movement
which had an effect but those of you old
enough to remember will remember that it
was 1967 1968
that's after about five years of war the
first several years of worry no protest
in fact when there were protests they
they were broken up violently with the
applause of the liberal press that
didn't happen in Iraq and it had some
kind of an effect and keep it keeping it
down now this it's commonly point
claimed that you know a lot of
wonderment about why there's so much
less protest against Iraq as compared
with Vietnam just think back at the time
when the Vietnam War was anything like
the Iraq war there was no protest at all
the speaker much higher protest in the
case of Iraq and it it's you know has a
kind of an effect obviously not enough
of an effect but something so you know
has more has to be done clearly in the
wake of the Free Gaza flotilla and the
attack on it the certainly the Israeli
government and the neo cons here have
made the interesting twist of demonizing
Turkey who I thought the US was relying
upon as an ally to help them extricate
themselves from Iraq so have you any
thoughts as to where that's taking us
well first of all just one slight
correction it's not the neo cons here
the other day I I occasionally
torture myself but listening
envy or driving home that's not the deal
guns that's the other end I was driving
home like a semester in Friday and was
listening to the news there all things
considered they have two commentators
for those of you who listen David Brooks
on the right and EJ Dionne on what's
called the left and that's the spectrum
and so those came up with question one
of the questions I think was Friday was
what do you think about the flotilla and
the two of them outdid each other in
tried outdo each other in sippers
support for the Israeli action I was
completely moral and just justified
maybe not carried out very well but
certainly correct
if you look through op-eds it's the same
New York Times has had a bunch of Abed's
about it either they come from
spokespeople for the Israeli government
government officials even or or also
they're supportive of them the United
States is kind of off the global
spectrum on this I don't you know I
don't read the whole world press but
from what I've seen in the world press
it's very angry about this even the the
kind of mainstream business press like
the London Financial Times but not here
it's not the Neo guns unfortunately it's
across the board it's a it's you're
quite right about the going after Turkey
I mean the thing has been reconstructed
as if in accord with Israeli government
propaganda that the real issue is
Turkish terrorists were attacking Israel
that's kind of like what I quoted from
the Israeli press about how Iran is it
is carrying out aggression against
Israel and southern Lebanon yeah or for
that matter Vietnam
take Vietnam what's an interesting case
in the early 60s when it was the Liberal
Democrats you know Kennedy
administration the line was that the
United States is facing internal
aggression in South Vietnam that was
Adlai Stevenson the liberal Europe
speaking at the UN says we're facing
internal aggression in South Vietnam
Kennedy called it an assault from within
that's what we're facing in South
Vietnam and that's a very and it's a
very typical component of Imperial
ideology we own the world
so wherever we get attacked and free
Israel the same thing and they're
smaller domains somebody's carrying out
aggression against us even if we're
invading their country and that's
happening right at this moment not just
in the case of Turkey in a much bigger
case you all know that the main of the
main policy foreign policy problem that
the Obama administration is facing
according to the analysts and
commentators is Iran the threat of Iran
well exactly what is the threat of Iran
we have an authoritative answer to that
there was just a study that came out
called the global military balance 2010
comes out every year by the Institute of
Strategic Studies I think it's called an
institute that's basically part of the
US government they come out with a an
analysis of the
military situation so of course they
have a section on Iran and they discuss
the threat of Iran that what's the
threat of Iran well it turns out it's
not a military threat they point out
that Iran has its military expenditures
are among the lowest in the region and
you know minuscule fraction of US
expenditures furthermore Iranian
military doctrine they point out is
designed to deter invasions so to try to
hold back aggression long enough so that
it can move to diplomacy that's their
military doctrine
they say if they're developing the clear
weapons it would be as a deterrent
against no very attack so so what's the
threat exactly this huge threat that we
have to face well it turns out it's a
political threat the usual kind the
threat is that Iran is what's called
destabilizing its neighbors how is it
destabilizing them by trying to increase
its influence it's trying to increase
its influence in the countries that are
its neighbors and that's aggression
because we own those countries when we
invade them that's not destabilization
that's imposing bringing about stability
just read the reports we're working to
bring about stability in the countries
surrounding Iran and their destabilizing
them by trying to extend their political
influence so they're a real threat
they're also the other threat of
supporting terror what is terror a
terror is Hezbollah and Hamas well you
know whatever you think about Hezbollah
and Hamas pretty hard to call what
they're doing terror as well as a
Lebanese organization it's now being
charged with developing
painting weaponry to enable it to deter
an Israeli invasion us-backed Israeli
invasion the kind Obama loves as he told
us in his website that's terrible
Hamas is trying to protect Hamas took
power in Gaza in an election they were
freely elected it's the only free
election in the Arab world and they
happen to win it and as soon as they won
the election the US and Israel
immediately now within days stepped up
an attack on the Palestinian population
to punish them for voting the wrong way
in a free election and that was the
first act of terror the next major act
of terror was you know that was January
2006 was in June 2007 when they took
power in in the Gaza eliminating Fatah
you know that I'll say Authority for it
that's the way it subscribed but if you
look closely that's not exactly what
happened what happened is that the US
and Israel with the help of the
Palestinian Authority try to carry out a
military coup to overthrow the elected
government and they beat back the
military coup and that's when they took
power that's when the siege really
stepped up that's a u.s. Israeli siege
of course well you know they're not I
mean I don't like them frankly and they
do a lot of brutal ugly things but it's
pretty hard to call that Iranian terror
but that's if the threat of Iran a
supporting terror and the
destabilization well you know if you own
the world that's natural
so in South Vietnam we face
internal aggression assault from within
and in the case you mentioned when
Israel with us support and us equipment
attacks about in international waters
killing people a major crime it's the
fault of the people on the boat now
they're the ones carrying out the
terrorism turkey in this case and it's a
tricky case as you mentioned because
turkey is a major ally and how they're
going to finesse this is not very clear
you know it's coming from Israel's point
of view apart from the criminality its
sheer insanity
I mean Turkey is their only regional
ally and a close ally it's been this
second closest ally after the United
States it's it's about since 1950s and
the you know the they use eastern Turkey
for military exercises military bases
there they're a major military Squier
Turkey in the flame of the relations in
the other direction to and to add innate
they're one ally by an act like criminal
act like this is profound irrationality
and one of many extremely irrational
acts that they're carrying out last
couple years which is pretty ominous
because it's a it's a powerful state
than when it's overcome by paranoia and
irrationality and hysteria there could
be real dangers I wanted that about a
totally different area which is on art
the the environment Hoover because of
the not only the oil that is leaking
from the British Petroleum explosion but
the methane that is being released and
methane is the worst heat trap
gasps that there is do you think that
people are going to start to wake up to
how fragile our planet is and that we
can't sustain wars that in Pakistan last
week they had the highest temperatures
they've ever had 128 degrees you know so
it do you think this is going to
there'll be something good coming out of
it last year as you probably read was
the warmest year on record the what's
going on in the Gulf is horrible enough
but it's worth noting a real racist
element to our concern about that I mean
it's a fraction of what's happened in
the nitrogen guilt Delta for example
where the huge oil spills going on all
the time causing enormous damage killing
all sorts of people but you know that's
like Africa's cares and it's not as
serious as the oil spills in the Amazon
by Texaco now Chevron so it's bad enough
but that's what we do all over the place
and nobody pays any attention
this town is us it becomes a big issue
yeah it's bad today Obama announced more
oil drilling it's going to renew Voyles
rule so the methane is no joke you're
quite right as as the permafrost melts
in Siberia and other places it's going
to piss the predictions are it's going
to release a huge amount of trapped
methane which you're correct is much
more dangerous than carbon dioxide
so a lot of other I mean these are
trying to what are called what are
called nonlinear events you know that
you can have a sudden spurt after things
go continue slowly absurd direction will
anything be done about it well it's
alright we're facing the question of
species survival in this case it's not
like nuclear weapons but unfortunately
there are institutional factors that
make it very hard to do anything it's
not that they're sort of bad people and
control the people who are making the
decisions are trapped by institutional
structures so for example there's tape I
mean the major power center in the
country unquestionably is the corporate
sector but if you're the CEO of a
corporation you don't have a lot of
choices you have to act so as to
increase short-term profit or else
you're out if you don't do that first of
all it's written it's it's required by
anglo-american law so if you don't do it
it's illegal but even apart from that if
you don't do it you're kicked out and
somebody comes in and does do it that's
the nature of the system the semi
competitive system now major
corporations and business associations
like Chamber of Commerce and so on
American Petroleum Institute they've
been carrying out large-scale campaigns
in the last couple of years to try to
convince the public that global warming
is a liberal hoax okay and it's
succeeding by now the proportion of the
public who thinks that believes in
anthropogenic global warming human
contributions global warming is barely
over a third declined sharply so the
propaganda campaigns have been
succeeding well you know these CEOs who
are carrying out this campaign
understand as well as you do that this
is no liberal hoax that it's going to
destroy what they own and destroy the
lives for the grandchildren they know
that as human beings but in their
institutional role as CEOs they have to
dismiss this as what's called an
externality and economic theory
something you put aside because it
doesn't have to do with making the best
market transactions well in this case
the externality happens to be the fate
of the species but it's still an
institutional requirement let's overcome
that is no small task that means really
reconstructing institutional structures
in a large-scale way and the limited
market is very limited market that we
have kind of compels those highly
destructive decisions it's the same in
financial markets so that's what's
called systemic risk
you know if Goldman Sachs they make some
transaction if they're following playing
the rule the game by the rules and a
half the where else you know there are
guys around they ignore they carry out a
transaction in such a
it benefits them and if it's a risk they
you know insure themselves against that
risk but they don't consider the effect
on the rest of the financial system
what's called systemic risk that's an
externality they ignore and it's built
into the system that they must ignore
even though it's understood that this is
you know brings about repeated financial
crises worse and worse of course that
can be overcome by a government
regulation from the depression until the
1970s when deregulation started
financialization of the economy began
during that whole period there were no
financial crisis because the regulatory
structure of the New Deal was sufficient
to constrain plus the whole way the
financial system was organized but since
the 70s they've been repeated crises
getting worse and worse we're likely
probably building up for the next one
right now and again this externality is
not accounted for well in the case of
systemic risk is at least an answer the
government can regulate sufficiently to
overcome this serious mid-market defect
in the case of the environment nobody's
going to do it unless God steps in
there's no one to control the
externalities the fate of the species
but that's what we're faced with so it
takes real work to try to do something
about this and how much time there is we
don't know I mean what we do know is the
longer we it's delayed the worse is
going to be how bad it'll be just guess
Barack Obama promised to close
Guantanamo within a year of becoming
president
he hasn't done so on that doesn't seem
to be any indication that he will so I
was wondering if you could address one
whether we understand his political and
legal reasons for not doing so and
whether you yourself see a type of
solution because it seems like the claim
is that there is no solution there's a
solution closer but actually the whole
Guantanamo case is kind of interesting
at one time we what right do we have to
be in Guantanamo altogether
I mean Guantanamo was stolen from Cuba
at gunpoint in 1902 the u.s. invaded
Cuba to prevent it from liberating
itself from Spain in the history books
here it says we invaded to liberate them
but that's not what happened Scholarship
has wiped that out we invaded to prevent
them from liberating themselves from
Spain among other things we at gunpoint
passed a amendment which required them
to hand us Guantanamo that mean for it
and you know the eastern part of the
island and one thought this treaty with
Cuba that there they want to get out of
who we want 11 which it does have
condition
on the use of Guantanamo supposed to be
a coaling station there's nothing on
that treatise that says you can use it
to store Haitian refugees that you don't
want that's what's being done for a long
time there's nothing in it that says you
can use it as a torture chamber so first
of all it's stolen at gunpoint by a
completely illegitimate fear of a treaty
and it's being used in violation of that
treaty furthermore the fact that it's a
torture chamber was obvious at the
beginning I can't understand why anyone
was surprised when the torture memos
came out I mean why have interrogation
carried out in Guantanamo instead of in
a prison in New York there's only one
reason you can claim that American law
doesn't apply there's no other reason
for it so of course it was going to be a
torture chamber and it is now it's not
the only one the Bagram Air Base in
Afghanistan is probably worse and if you
look at the legal rigor the Supreme
Court did pass a decision that make a
decision that contrary and overturned
the Bush administration ever claimed
that and ruled that prisoners in
Guantanamo have habeas corpus rights
well that the Bush administration tried
to restraint that to say well it just
applies to wanton Omo not to other
interrogation centers like Bagram but
the district courts in fact the Bush
appointee in the district court ruled
that it applies everywhere
okay the Obama Justice Department is now
trying to
tournament they're trying to outflank
push from the right on torture and try
to get the courts to decide that it
doesn't apply to say fibro which means
Glenn Greenwald pointed out a blog that
what that means is that if the United
States captures somebody say in Yemen
and decides it wants to torture them
they can't send the Guantanamo to be
tortured but the incentive Agra being
different you know well that's a Obama
you know on the legal issues it's it's
not it not much of a record the few
things that are improvements over Bush
but not on the main ones and this is an
example but there's snow there is no
problem at Guantanamo it can just be
closed why should the United States be
running torture chambers what where did
the detainees go if we close Guantanamo
either you bring them to court and try
them and if they're guilty in a fair
trial sentence somewhere else you free
them unless what what if the countries
don't take them back we should provide
refuge for them but that's what criminal
trials are I suppose you're arrested for
something you're not supposed to be
tortured
they're supposed to be brought to trial
on if there's a charge against UK
government tries to present it and if
you're free you're free
well that's the problem
they don't have credible charges against
them if they did they could bring them
to trial
that's why Obama is in favor of military
commissions which don't have anything
like the guarantees of fair trial I mean
there's a claim well reward they're
prisoners of war or something like that
but you know that kind of a claim
anybody could make about anything are we
out of time Sarah this yes so there are
three commercials before we end
nomes book is outside for sale and it's
called it has an optimistic title
actually what is the title tell me the
title of your book hopes and prospects
that sounds good so I think everyone
should buy a copy um we have two more
weeks of prophecy and please tell your
friends we're not yet sold out we would
like to be very much and thanks to Peace
Action for creating with us this evening
and this benefit and they would like to
say and I would like to say of course
that we should all take peace action in
our lives and do whatever we can to
change things so thank you very much
thank you
