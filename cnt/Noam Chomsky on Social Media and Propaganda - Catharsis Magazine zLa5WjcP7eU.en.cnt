first of all that's for the comment that
I don't use Twitter that continues to be
true I don't for the same reasons I
don't find anything of interest there
it's a way to shut off your mouth and
see words on some topic fine the social
media has no real impact on the
propaganda mobile propaganda model was
study of the major institutions that
provide the fundamental sources of news
and information on which the general
public relies ly news that appears on
social media let's say on Facebook is
drawn from the maitre media they don't
have their own investigative reporters
in the field looking at what's happening
in young for example the some of the the
fact remains that the basic source of
news information opinion analysis is the
basic is the media matron Institute
media the propaganda model simply
studies their structure says what is the
nature of these institutions what is the
audience that what is the audience to
which they sell their product product
mean viewers or readers what is their
what are their relations with other
power systems like the government and
from this network interpose the
institutional social arrangements I
tried to do some conclusions about what
we expect the content of the media to be
that's the model then comes the
investigation my particle study just
seeking to determine whether in fact the
expectations that derive from the
analysis of institutional structures
accounts for what we actually find in
the media in fact our own book
manufacturing consent is mostly case
studies but don't you see I mean do you
see our sort of her over centralization
towards Facebook
the power of information towards
Facebook anyhow I think that the
decentralization of the access to
information through the few mega
corporations that by now virtually
monopolized information transmission
Facebook Google Google and the zone I
think that's extremely dangerous
