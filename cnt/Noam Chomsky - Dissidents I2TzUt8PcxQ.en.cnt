let's take Iran okay the duty of an
Iranian dissident inside Iran is not to
join the huge chorus of condemnation of
the crimes of Israel in the United
States of the crimes are very real the
duty of a honest honorable person in
Iran would be to criticize the crimes of
Iran and we understand that in the old
Soviet Union we respected the dissidents
suffer of and others because of their
criticism of the crimes the repression
violence of their own country
we didn't care what they said about the
US war in Vietnam but none of their they
in fact if they've supported it who
cared that we honored them for doing
what they had to do within their own
countries same with Gaza Havel we honor
him because we because of his struggle
as courageous struggle against
repression and violence where he was
whether the fact is that he did support
us crimes but that's marginal do you
regard your cycle as a disconnects is
quite different are you a dissident
professor do I disagree with what what
is it this isn't me I don't you've been
using the term an interesting term we
use the term the term conventionally is
used in the United States only for
critics in enemy States we don't call
critics in the United States or its
allies dissidents that's part of a
propaganda system what would you call
yourself a person who gives my opinion
about the international domestic affairs
well but but they have flavor to your
opinions to be high it happens to be the
kind of criticism which we call
dissidents in enemy states so therefore
we should call that here to not accept
the propaganda device of restricting it
to enemies we should apply it to
ourselves as well no I want men to
continue I'm
not comparable to the dissidents in the
Soviet Union in Iran for many reasons
for one thing they were under under much
harsher repression in comparably harsher
secondly I do extensively condemn the
crimes of enemies they didn't in fact
what I do
so there's many differences
