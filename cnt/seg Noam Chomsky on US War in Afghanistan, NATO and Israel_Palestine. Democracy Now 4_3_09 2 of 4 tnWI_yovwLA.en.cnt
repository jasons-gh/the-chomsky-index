that was demonstrated in September 1999
when Bill Clinton under very extensive
domestic and international pressure
finally decided to call it off he didn't
have to vanja car that he didn't have to
impose an embargo he just told the
indonesian generals game's over and they
immediately withdrew that goes down in
history is a great humanitarian
intervention that's not exactly the
right story right up until then the
United States was continuing to support
the atrocities Britain under its new
ethical foreign policy didn't quite get
in on time and they kept supporting them
even after the Australian led UN
peacekeeping force center well that's
NATO ten years ago that's even putting
aside the claims about Serbia which may
be a word about those are worth while we
know what happened in Serbia there's a
massive in Kosovo there's massive
documentation from the State Department
from NATO European Union observers on
the ground there was a level of
atrocities sort of distributed between
the guerrillas and the Serbs but it was
expected that the NATO bombing would
radically increase the atrocities which
it did if you look back at the launch of
it in tight Minh in the middle of the
bombing almost entirely about a trust
except for one exception about
atrocities after the NATO bombing that's
what they anticipated General Clark and
commanding general had informed
Washington weeks earlier yes that would
be the consequence he informed the press
of that as the bombing started that was
the humanitarian intervention while NATO
was supporting even worse trustees right
within NATO in East Timor and go on in
other cases well that's NATO ten years
ago and it begins to tell us what NATO
is for is it for defending Europe from
attack in fact there is such a pretense
know so when the President Bush put
started installing missile defense
systems in Eastern Europe
the claim was well this is to defend you
were from attack against Iranian nuclear
tipped missiles in fact that doesn't
have any doesn't matter and the fact
that if it had any it would be total
insanity for them to even arm one
because the country be vaporized in
thirty seconds so it's a threat to
Russia again just like Clinton's
expansion of NATO to these France
joining France joining now rejoin
friends joining is quite interesting I
mean France had a policy initiated by
general the goal of trying to turn
Europe into it was in called a third
force independent of the two superpowers
so Europe should pursue an independent
course was you spoke of Europe from the
Atlantic to the Urals that was a great
fear of the United States since the
Second World War that would strike out
on his own after reconstructing which it
could the economies on the scale of the
United States no reason that accepted
military force it's comparable of the
United States so it could have been a
move towards a peaceful Europe
independent of the superpowers in fact a
large part of the purpose of NATO was to
prevent that from happening to ensure
that that your would stay within the
u.s. umbrella under us control well
Francis now abandoned that position and
has rejoined what is now just a an
intervention force in international
intervention force exactly as james
jones and jeff ER and others portray it
that's an international intervention
force under US command why should it
exist in fact if you go back to nineteen
eighty nine in nineteen ninety it's
extremely interesting to see how the
United States reacted to the collapse of
the Soviet Union so right after the fall
of the berlin wall which twenty years
ago which signaled the end of the soviet
union clearly the bush administration
bush one immediately released the
National
security strategy military budget and so
on which are very interesting reading
what they say in fact is everything is
going to go on exactly as before but
with new pretext so now we have to have
a huge military establishment and
military budget and not to protect
themselves from the Russians who are
collapsing but because literally because
of the technological sophistication of
third world powers that was promulgated
without a without ridicule you know if
someone was watching from Mars they
collapse and laughter so because of the
technological sophistication of third
world powers keep this huge military
budget we have to keep intervention
forces and at the Middle East the main
target of intervention why not because
of the Russians it said as had been
claimed what it said was if they direct
the intervention forces to the Middle
East where our problems could not be
laid at the Kremlin's door so in other
words we've been lying to you for 50
years but now the clouds have lifted so
we just have to have intervention
courses aimed at the Middle East which
we have to control it we have to
maintain they called the the defense
industrial base that's a euphemism for
high technology industry that's why you
have things like computers and the
internet and so on so that's the massive
state sector of the high-tech economy we
have to maintain that again because of
you know the threat of the third world
and so on others everything remains the
same the pre to exchange that passed
without a whisper Noam Chomsky I want to
get to Afghanistan it's the main topic
of NATO its debate around the issue of
the expansion of war in Afghanistan
President Obama's initiative is not the
main topic of debate in the United
States meaning whether or not we should
be doing this what do you think well
it's interesting it is the topic of
discussion in the United States right in
the middle of the establishment so
foreign affairs the main establishment
journal had
an interesting article probably six
months ago roughly by two of the leading
specialists on Afghanistan Barnett Rubin
and Ahmed Rashid and the basic point was
that the United States should give up
the idea that military victory is the
answer to everything that said that the
United States should reorient its policy
so that there would be a regional
solution in which the interest in the
concerned countries that includes
crucially Iran but also India Russia
China would themselves work at a
regional settlement and that the Afghans
should work something out among
themselves he went they pointed out
correctly that the regional countries
are not happy about having a NATO
military center based in Afghanistan so
they see a threat to them now this this
pass this is not what's being done
there's some gestures towards maybe some
undersecretary a little say hello to an
Iranian representative or something but
that's not the core of the policy that's
being pursued now that side by side with
that is something else that's been
happening there is a significant peace
movement in Afghanistan exactly its
scale we all know but it's enough so
that Pamela constable of the Washington
Post in a recent article in Afghanistan
argued that when they knew American
troops come they're going to face two
enemies the Taliban and public opinion
meaning the peace we want that whose
slogan is put down the weapons and we
don't mind if you're here but for aid
and development we don't want any more
fighting in fact we know from Western
run polls that about 75% of Afghans are
in favor of negotiations among Afghans
now that includes the Taliban who are
Afghan
the affected even includes the ones in
Pakistan there's the difference if the
really trouble areas now our pashtoon
areas which are split by a British
imposed line or official line called the
Durand Line which was imposed by the
British to protect British India
expanded and they never accepted it just
cuts their territory in half Afghanistan
when it was a functioning state they
were accepted it right through the 1970s
but certainly the Afghan Taliban or
Afghans and the President Karzai
formerly our man no longer because he's
getting out of control how how is it
getting out of control interesting ways
when President Obama was elected Afghan
President Karzai scent of a message
which as far as I know it was unanswered
and which he pleaded with President
Obama to stop killing Afghans he also
addressed a UN delegation and told them
he wanted a timetable for the removal of
foreign forces well his popularity
quickly plummeted he used to be very
much praised for his nice clothes great
demeanor very much admired by the media
and commentators now he's sunk very low
he's suddenly corrupt and so I mean
