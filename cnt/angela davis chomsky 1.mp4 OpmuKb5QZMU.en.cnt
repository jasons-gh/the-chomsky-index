the future will be 15 what we put into
it now I am humbled to be on the stage
here with two intellectuals whose words
commitments and actions have been my
life's beacons I first encountered no
jobs he threw his book American power
and the new mandarins 1969 this exact
book was tucked away in my parents
bookshelf in Calcutta
I remember puzzling over the dead cover
the dedication to it to the brave young
men who refused to serve in a criminal
war
Calcutta was an unusual place the street
that housed the US and UK consulates had
been renamed Ho Chi Minh ceramic of Ho
Chi Minh Street and demonstrations were
a regular feature there through the
early 1970s jumps his book was in
solidarity with the Vietnamese it was in
solidarity with the US youth who refused
to fight and form the detachment in the
anti-war struggle it was also in
solidarity with those who stole our army
at the mouth of Ho Chi Minh suddenly
chanting slogans against the war it has
been a long journey for me to reach
Chomsky on intellectuals goodness
between the lure of complicity and the
courage of commitment to reach Chomsky
on US imperialism to reach Chomsky on
the Middle East to reach Chomsky on
Easter moon to reach Chomsky on
Yugoslavia like most of you I love the
geography and ethics to the writings of
Noam Chomsky
angelababy's Angela Davis into my life
on a Forester
these were Legion in the book shops
along free-school street alongside
posters of Lima Khalid loosely
phenomenally and yes yes blondie
in those bookshops iPhone Angela Davis
and autobiography 1974 I hope all of you
who have read it it opens like a
thriller
I believe I thanked her but I'm not sure
and it ends with that great luminous
line but first the glass the Sun and the
people between these lines is the coming
of age of political age of a courageous
and dynamic intellectual out of the
south into the cauldrons of the 1960s
bringing the struggles for dignity into
the heart of the struggles against
capitalism drawing us movements into
conversation and active solidarity with
internationalism with Cuba at the heart
of it being imprisoned for her view
being imprisoned for her views and this
latter this experience of imprisonment
driving Angela Davis to her formidable
analysis of prisons and the prison
industrial complex to the creation of
course of critical resistance and to the
most recent book the meaning of freedom
whose meaning will certainly be a part
of our conversation the future will only
contain what we couldn't do it now our
entry point is the back side of history
the prisons and the Wars the smell of
desolation and destruction it is
conventional wisdom
these mattress prisons and war are
international and that if we always were
able to make the correct arguments about
them good people in power would see the
light and break down the jail walls
those swords into plowshares but history
does not move on good arguments alone
and no does it afford good people in
high places the opportunity to simply
turn history's wheel by their intentions
from noam chomsky Angela Davis and a
legion of others we have learned that in
fact prisons and walk other rational
extension of the system in which we live
capitalism is a job-killing and resource
devouring machine monopoly over
technology allows the owners of capital
to arbitrage the dreams of the many by
using machines to supplant workers and
by using the fruits of the machines and
the earth to enrich themselves this is
why capitalism general tendency is
toward dehumanization to let loose the
Four Horsemen of the modern apocalypse
poverty war social despair and finally
change since the credit crisis the world
has seen a deficit of 50 million jobs
with 600 million people looking for work
of these at least 75 million
young people a plurality of those at
work are either unable to make ends meet
have to seek two jobs or have to curtail
all hope of betterment as a consequence
the index of social unrest shows that
more than half the countries in the
world see an increase in unrest with
Africa Eastern and Central Europe and
the Middle East as the core areas of
social protest the medicine for the
slowdown is the same tonic that said
most of the global South in to Cataclysm
in the 1980s it used to be called
structural adjustment and is now known
simply and cruelly as austerity drastic
cuts in the United States to the world
with illusionary fiscal cliff will bring
this country into line with the
austerity regimes in place in southern
Europe and large sections of Africa
Obama has promised two and a half
dollars in cuts for every dollar in
spending if the economic dustbowl has
already begun to clean up vast swathes
of US cities the next stage of austerity
will be unyielding that social unrest in
the Middle East and Africa
and that social dislocation in the
landscape of America and of the American
Dream will create the objective
conditions for most and more prisons
capitalism narrows the corridors of
public policy preventing humane
solutions to the crisis when unless
breaks out in Egypt it can only offer
the transient and the
yes in Yemen and Pakistan it is the
drone attack in the cities of the United
States it is is us some camels and
supermax prisons these are the emblems
of social welfare in the age of
austerity to end the reign of war in
prison
we cannot beg capitalism's Praetorian
guards to simply stand down we have to
build a massive movement that carries
other ideas forward that believes in
jobs not money in life over life
sentences the future will only contain
in her autobiography Angela Davis
mentions Howard Brandeis she felt alien
but found the community amongst the
foreign students one in particular gets
mentioned love it was stolen from in
here it was my friendship with love it
more than anything else
she writes that helped me understand
completely the interconnectedness of the
freedom struggles of people's throughout
the world I'm not just reading this for
you because it mentions in the other
when I met
my my swim
an Indian was part of your political
I think when Carl was the projectory of
writing about afro-asian interactions
probably stems
most important here other than the
Indian bit my most important here is the
emphasis on friendship and our
conversation on building the social
networks of trust through which we help
each other
gain confidence to act against systems
that seem self-evident it is never
enough to passively learn the most
important things one has to learn them
in community as the learning becomes
part of reinforcing community and as the
community gets confidence to challenge
everything that works to break down our
social bonds events such as these and
organizations such as critical
resistance the city school and black and
pink are a form of building community of
making sure that we have each given
confidence to champion the world we
believe in and the world we want to live
in
Aquaman tonight is very simple first no
one will speak then Angela will speak
then we go back to the chairs where will
hold the conversation after which there
will be some questions although some of
the questions might come during our
conversation I'd like you to know that
over the course of the past few weeks
several organizations in Boston have
been discussing ideas and actions and
they've prepared some questions but
we'll go to the head of the queue in
fact I'll call on them if the house
lights go up it will be easier if the
house lights go up it will be much
easier then we can see you right now
it's very unusual
see it's much better like this
nice-looking room if you have questions
and I'm not part of these groups please
either be patient or forgive us if we
have a lot of time so that's my apology
from the beginning but first oopah
Chomsky style
Rachel asked me to talk about two topics
part of the working part of it that one
is the criminalization industry the
second one related to what is the
assault on the african-american
population for population generally in
the best generation that are related to
matter of the racial strategies that
have been devised and implemented to
carry all this through the obvious place
to start was in the 1960s with the civil
rights movement then this iconic figure
Martin Luther King when you listen to
the oratory on Martin Luther King Day
I'm sure you've noticed it typically
ends in 1963 with his I have a dream
speech in Washington but that's not
where evidence came in fact for him that
was just the very beginning he intended
to go on and
and immediately ran into a brick wall
because he was beginning to deal with
class issues and with issues in the
north so it's okay to condemn racist
alabama sheriff's but not what happens
around here and issues of class which is
what it turns you know was assassinated
five years later when he was in Memphis
where did it strike with public service
workers and additional workers and on
his way to lead a march which would
bring about a core people through
another March to Washington well made he
did he was killed
they gave it I have a dream speech the
evening house killed used his usual
biblical rhetoric said that he felt he
was like Moses standing on a mountain he
couldn't see the promised land he knew
he would never get there but if you
struggle on you can get there
they are my destination communities of
the night
the workers say the name it's necessary
for us to realize that we've moved from
the era of civil rights that you're
enough human debates providing jobs
they're developing better age education
raising who were throughout the
Directorate of the truth life working
like America must recognize that justice
for black cutworm cannot be achieved
without the radical changes bolstering
our society southern TYT civil because
currently present communicant or best
practices that like must melt angels
we agreed to pageants mirrored on the
Rach SP it here at the British Howard
have seen the are degrees initially
problems I mean for me personally
communities deal with the population
which was were also victims by
explaining what some racial pride
exploiting the fears of working people
and working-class whites in the very
classic ways all through history to try
to break down the Solidarity and the
mutual support that are what are
desperately needed to address the real
problems of the whole society a major
part of it in the mid seventies was some
people redesign the economy and the word
design was critical it wasn't just
something that
sir plans changes of the nature economy
alternatives available all the time that
two major factors of it were the shift
from production to manipulation of
finance huge increases the
nationalization you could make more
money that way by playing games
complicated financial instruments that
but there's new things the production
didn't continue improves offshore you
can use miserable horrendous working
conditions in Mexico China
if nominal adesh to replace working
people in the United States one effect
of this it wonder the many effects with
this one that's very visible is what
happened in different way of critical
way of maintaining at least the floor
under the living standards were people
working people through the post New Deal
theory period of great worth the neat
economy and pretty egalitarian growth
where the minimum wage kept up with
productivity of Labor
that's totally change if they had
continued past the seventies the minimum
wage
be about $25 $25 that's one side of the
assault against the general population
the high school the needle liberal
assault to be generous talking about all
over the world gear to that hit
primarily working people and poor people
disproportionately black because of the
race class correlation also working
class whites and they had to their
concerns haven't dealt with to that's
really the racial strategists come in to
deal with this problem one device that
was constructed that was to eliminate
superfluous populations and not by
murdering that began around 1980 really
1982 those would begin it if you go back
to that period around 1980 the criminal
population in the United States was
relative the population was about the
same as other industrial societies
so what happened happened in Institute
was dealt with prevention and treatment
the only things the work that changed in
1982 that that component is secured and
it was done strictly racist fashion
infertility races those of you almost
remember
Reaganites favorite anecdotes about the
will fare meanings rich black women were
driven in their limousines to do one
after another of wealth they were also
specific loss of do they take your
hard-earned money well then that meant
something to poor weight working people
who are also being smashed in the face
they're taking our money but blessing
and other strategies were designed so as
to sit where people each other's throats
to take Boston for examination typically
the suburbs most employed you're not
involved in the blessing it was between
south southwest
pirate communities like Roxbury
Dorchester communities so that led to
the feeling understandable that their
economic they've taken aware of money
they're taking aware of communities the
integration of programs were designed so
that they would there would be nothing
if you know understanding among poor
white people with authority being are
not much
so when you integrate fire departments
Police Department of course not
seriously the Faculty of sweets made
clear three black faces allowed in there
then there's people who are suffering so
they're taking their money they you know
they they're taking our mining they're
taking their communities
they're taking their jobs we're left
with nothing and you can see it it just
take a look at the last election see a
very strengthening bank but you looked
at the electoral results the maps the
day after the election you know the red
and blue states it's the civil war the
only thing that's changed is the names
written works that used to be Democrat
or no Republican Nixon's Southern
Strategy changed names the racism
majority of the four white working
people voted to cut their own throats
were poles for example southern whites
just saw their boys asking them what
their attitudes were about taxes like
everyone else in the country
well mainly they were in favor raising
taxes on the on the rich which would
ridiculously low however that same
majority was in favor from his tax plan
you know it possible worth ignorance or
possibly it's just racism since he's on
our side you know going after them we're
going to favor his well you know a lot
of this stuff worked it was played very
effectively
why 1982 well that's as I said when the
drug alert was started and it was very
specifically designed carefully designed
so would go after the African population
that begins with the police discretion
so we're needed to to make arrests would
be good for the you know town town small
32 goodly rich white suburbs actually
use of drugs is higher in the rich waits
over
professionals students the point isn't
to go after drugs
the minutes to fight a race water that
goes on through respiratory all
discretion trust me to the north
latitude to do through the sentencing
programs which you can get huge
sentences for having the tiny bit of
crack in your possession or for that
matter for having somebody you don't
even know about putting something in
your house tremendous damage so the
other they had for driving under the
influence
you know after they'd get a couple of
days out driving under the influence of
alcohol or drugs chills way more people
and of course all the pales totally
that's compared with the major to a
killer tobacco tobacco monstrous killer
the is just an academic study that came
out of told that the backdoor pilot for
which estimates that about a hundred
million people were killed but to that
in the West century and there's a little
bit billion in the next century
expendable it is but strikingly useless
tobacco has been significantly modified
it's not pretty much a class issue you
know university students or smoking
it became a class issue because of
cultural changes in education but just
the kind of things that in fact are
going to work if you have to read the
New York Times a couple days ago you
might have noticed an interesting story
there finally have in class action suits
which controls the back of the companies
from their point of view of pennies that
to compensate for the extraordinary
massacre that they've carried out but
the states are not using the money for
prevention and treatment even though
their own data shows not right that it's
effective but it's a little money saved
up a lot of money it's highly effective
though the amount spent mentioned
treatments sharply reduces
hospitalization for sentencing the
discretionary programs of the ridiculous
sentences created a black population
which is stigmatized for life you never
get out of it if you've been a minor you
can't get job you can't get housing
that's thanks to Bill Clinton his
achievements was the one strike you're
out policy any conviction you're out of
public even if you suspected
know that this is a reproduction of
things that have happened before years
that was literal slavery slavery was
formally ended in 1860s
Westen's for about ten years but then a
new process was developed with
criminalization of black life so if a
black man is standing on a street corner
he choose the vagrancy it's a $20 fine
she can't pay festival to death and he's
in jail forever he ends up in the
prisons the prisoners became the
fantastic labor force much better than a
slave labor force slave owners used to
criticize northern industrialists
claiming that they were the one more
because they own their workforce so they
had to take care of
take care of the northern investor those
just rented their labor fears they might
have thrown out well once you have the
state maintaining the labor force you
know it's for the industrialists it's
frequent that we're familiar with the
chain names that's the agricultural part
but a large part of the American
industrial revolution the 19th century
was based on mining steel plants so huge
labor dollars criminalize the labor
force that went on almost for the second
world war when it was necessary to free
labor to work and overwork the army then
came about 20 years of substantial
economic growth what man could get a job
in an auto plant it was unionized in
those days
pretty decent wages by a small town sent
to keep your college event ended
incentives for the reasons I mentioned
we go right back to criminalisation
that's exactly what's done there now a
lot of an estimated about a million
laborers in the prison system and
working for a pittance of course but a
perfect labor force
I think well that there's a way out of
this mainly solidarity in the nineteen
thirties
what happened was with the rise of the
labor movement there was black wait
working class solidarity people working
together for something for down the
racial barriers that had happened in the
eighteen nineties effect in the labor
movement on the property but it was
beaten back by violence by racial
strategy we're now there again without
the Solidarity that has to be
reconstructed so the collective Martin
Luther King when I raise questions about
the basic questions with the whole
society and move from the year of reform
to one of the revolution might be
necessary to address problems like these
to overcome the propaganda to educate
people about and recreate the kind of
solidarity and mutual support that's
essential for making any progress in the
face of all kinds of sorts
good evening one it is a real honor to
be here this evening especially since
this is the first time I've had the
opportunity to personally meet no
Chomsky
on the radio annum on CDs forever
hello he actually is exactly the same
and two months ago we both participated
in the Russell tribunal on Fausto under
the weather that's type in that's why I
said this is the first time I've
actually had the opportunity to meet him
in person and this time it's my turn to
have a really bad cold and I almost
stayed at home and Skype did but I woke
up at 2:30 this morning I thought about
Noam Chomsky I thought about Vijay
Prashad milk
all the amazing people from critical
resistance and the two other
organizations that are co-sponsoring
this benefit the city school and
blackton ping
2:30 this morning I could hear my
deceased mother's voice telling me that
she knew I could do
and headed for the airport hoping that I
would feel a little bitter and so here I
am trying to offer you some ideas about
the future of course is always relative
its relational a future
is a future always in relationship to a
past and a present we are living a
present today that in many ways was
unimaginable as the future twenty years
ago thirty or forty years and of course
when Obama was elected the first time so
many people said that they have never
expected to witness the election of a
black president in their lifetime of
misery and then later I suppose many
thought that it was unimaginable for a
black man to act like a president of the
United States but after all like that is
what he is but some of us can say that
we never expected that racist violence
and indeed racism more broadly would
persist in such blatant and insidious
ways well into the 21st century
once the mid twentieth century freedom
movement took home many of us expected
that was
a matter of time before we begin to root
out racism when most of us try to
imagine a future for ourselves for our
communities for our worlds we think
about futures without violence am i
right
without the violence of war without the
violence of occupation without police
violence without school violence without
racist violence without Islamophobic
right answer without ablest violence
without homophobics islands without
sexist violence without prison violence
which can only mean without prisons
it's no more violence 745 years ago I
remember being involved in a number of
campaigns against races police violence
and I think I believe then that progress
would be would come in a much more
obvious way I think I believed that
there was no way that the same kind of
racist violence would persist 20 30 40
years later and all of us of course
remember the killing of Trayvon Martin
earlier this year and I notice reading
the New York Times yesterday that George
Zimmerman is once again in the news in
relation to this suit against NBC for
editing is remarks and for making him
appear to be a racist predator great but
but what I would say is that what has
not changed is when it's not changed is
the assumption we often make that we
make too often that individuals bear the
brunt of responsibility for that racist
violence and you think back maybe seven
or eight months ago when there was a
flurry of activity around Trayvon Martin
his name was in the news every day there
were demonstrations and all kinds of
events and then what happened
George Zimmerman was arrested you
remember and then all the activity stops
if all stop it came to a halt as if the
arrest of a single person a single
perpetrator
they let me say that this is actually
one very strong argument for prison
abolition put in one person in prison
cannot reverse a whole history of races
- putting people in prison cannot
address the issues that that
imprisonment attempts to address but let
me say that this is a strong argument
for seeking ways other than imprisonment
to dismantle the structures of violence
and generators now when we think about
violence we tend to think about male
bodies as the targets of violence rate
of violence and war violence in prison
violence on the street however the most
consistent targets of violence in the
world are
again the most consistent targets of
violence in our villages our talents and
our cities wherever we might find
ourselves in the world are women this
leads us to counter the connections
between intimate violence
family violence rape battering femicide
on the one hand and police violence
vigilante violence on the other this
leads us to ask questions about the
relationship between racist violence
gender violence intimate violence state
violence to discover the complicated
ways in which these modes of violence
are organically linked is I think the
work of imagining radical futures we
cannot imagine radical futures if we do
not grasp these connections there have
been vast movements against violence
against women all over the world for the
last 40 years studies have proliferated
programs that developed and expanded law
enforcement people have received more
trainings than you can possibly imagine
there are programs with imprisonment yet
that violence continues unabated the
violence continues more perpetrators of
gender violence are imprisoned all over
the world now that ever before but the
incidents of violence against women has
not gone down and it is not surprising
that communities have have historically
suffered numerous war
of violence from slavery to war to
police violence to our incarceration to
our punishment within the educational
system it is not surprising that girls
and women in these communities suffer a
disproportionate burden of intimate
violence as horrendous as it made me
should we really be surprised that
family violence and intimate sexual
assault continues to keep pace with the
proliferation of institutional and
structural violence in the world
violence against women and girls not
only bolsters gender-based hierarchies
but class hierarchies and racial
hierarchies as well and a culture that
continues to pathologize women of color
and criminalize men of color isn't at
all surprised surprising that violence
pervades intimate relationship violence
is used to address social problems so
that the majority of the almost two and
a half million people behind bars in the
u.s. today are people of color black
students are much more likely to be
punished in schools and white students
from kindergarten through high school
but why is it so difficult to think
about violence against women and girls
without thinking about law enforcement
and carceral strategies as the solution
of course there is a relationship but we
tend to assume
that that relationship should involve
the incarceration of perpetrators and
this may be because we have no sense of
the future
it may be because we have no historical
sense because we want instant solutions
we want instant solutions to the problem
and perhaps also instant solutions to
the problem of thinking about the
problem so if we if we look at law
enforcement that incarceration as
shortcuts that allow us to shift our
focus from something that is very
painful to reflect on to an expression
of anger of revenge of retribution that
is what the prison allows us to do that
is what the strategy of imprisonment
encourages us to do and so what I'm
trying to say is that the logic of
criminalization and incarceration is a
logic of diversion and deflection we
have acquired that habit of shifting our
focus to punishment rather than dwelling
there at a very difficult place in order
to eventually hopefully discover ways of
eliminating violence not simply
punishing it with more violence and they
for reproducing this violence
logic of diversion and deflection do it
really only have 45 minutes 25 seconds
left I just looked at my time limit now
it says 33 seconds well one of the
points that I was going to make is that
whenever we address the question
institutional violence we also have to
look at the family which is a safe of
the social reproduction of an exploitive
system family is inconceivable without
its role as a haven for violence
but in my time hetero patriarchal
violence is also replicated in some
same-sex relationships so this is one of
the reasons why being in favor of gay
marriage is not so simple
how do we challenge the structure of
Hana the structure of manage
and I was gonna have to just summarize
some of the things that I was going to
say when I talk about battle and
violence against women violence against
trans women violence against and I could
say that I just came back from Sparta
why I'm sick in the first place I've
been traveling too much minute too many
planes but I just hate that from the
world Social Forum
Brazil and let me say that our work on
prison abolition has to extend to the
abolition of open air prisons as well
exactly imagine radical futures we have
to commit ourselves to work on
theoretical and practical terrain that
is broad and expensive rather than
narrow and restrictive I know we tend to
use the term intersectionality and I
think we've grown too comfortable with
that term and I wonder whether we should
continue to search for formulations that
come closer to what we mean when we say
we don't want to focus on single issue
approaches but rather approaches that
require us to think deeply about links
and connections and relations among
issues and among struggle Israel and one
of the problems with the notion of
intersexuality is that we often think of
it as a point of crossing as a point
where axes cross each other and even
though that point of crossing need not
be can see the seed of VG aesthetic - I
just wanted to say in relation to the
Palestine Solidarity campaign that the
critique of big washing has become
really important and the sense
not only reveals the shallowness and the
contemptuous character of the democracy
that israel purports to represent but it
broadens the terrain of struggle against
the occupation and against the zionist
policies of israel and if you everybody
was with people watching is right in two
words the representation of israel as
gay friendly and as supporting women's
rights and so what we have to do is
learn how to read the racism and
violence that is covered up by this
putative program
our future we might not have been able
to imagine a generation or two ago what
are the futures we strive toward today
let us not be afraid to imagine the most
radical possible futures even when it is
said this goes against human nature
without prisons for example who be
unable to deal with the dangerous people
of the world the process of imagining
radical futures with prospects for
freedom requires us to stretch our minds
and our vocabularies and to recognize
that even if prison abolition or the
eradication of violence cannot be
achieved in our lifetimes let us stretch
our imagination much further than our
lifetime
president Douglas let it be was they
never have been able to imagine our
desert but without the movements with
which they were associated we would have
no foundation on which to build radical
futures today thank you
you
