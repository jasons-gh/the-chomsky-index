much professor for this very much valued
lecture my name is Dolly Anna Maria my
reporter for the Egyptian television I'm
covering your lecture for TV and we'd
like to ask you a question I'm sorry if
you have to repeat something that you
already said but what is your command on
Israel prohibiting you to enter the
Palestinian territories why do you think
Israel did that and are you afraid that
this is turning into an appetite system
with all means thank you I'm sorry I
didn't we why does Israel not allow
people to move freely within the
territories is that the question your
comment on the fact that Israel did not
permit you to enter Palestine you need
to enter that was just I mean in terms
of it has no cosmic importance it's it's
not of any general significance that's a
nuisance for me it's a nuisance for you
but it's just it's it's a very minor
example that's something that's
happening in Israeli policies which are
much greater significance only their
irrationality of their acting in a very
paranoid irrational fashion which is
great harm to themselves I'm in a good
example was the humiliation of the
Turkish ambassador I'm sure that you
followed that turkeys outside the United
States their most valued Ally since
nineteen fifty eight it's been there one
major ally outside the United States and
region it's their only Allah and could
purposely is important one from every
point of view including military
so Israel uses eastern Turkey for
airfields training and potential bases
and so on well you know taking to go out
of your way to humiliate the ambassador
of turkey is a pretty ridiculous action
in a rational state doesn't act that way
and it's the same when Biden Joseph
Biden showed up and they purposely
insulted in by announcing the expansion
of settlements this is not rational and
there are the things like that an
irrational stated any any state is
dangerous if it's irrational a powerful
military force with nuclear weapons is
extremely dangerous if it's irrational I
can give it actual examples but they say
the United States if you go back to
nineteen sixty through the prime the
missile crisis we know the details now
the records have come out there was a
point of the missile crisis where
Kennedy could have ended that will ruin
it could have ended it by accepting an
offer from for chef which he recognized
was reasonable but he refused him he
wanted to show how powerful it could be
and insult the Russians and he decided
to face a risk which he estimated about
one-third of nuclear war which would
have destroyed the northern hemisphere
just order to show how macho he was
that's basically what happened so powers
powerful states can act irrationally
well you know Israel isn't the United
States but could act irrationally in
ways that are much more dangerous than
humiliating the Turkish ambassador say
not letting me come in which is
insignificant and there isn't any
rational basis for that just like
there's no rational basis for the
threats against Iran I mean the Iran has
terrible government they were going to
rotten things that their other
governments are worse and then they're
not a serious threat except the threat
of deterrence there are threat of
deterrence and expanding their influence
and Israel is turning it into what they
call an existential threat it's a threat
to our existence and that could lead to
a very irrational Act and I don't have
to go into it you can guess what it
might be but these are some of the
dangers in the region and unless there
is a move quickly towards a diplomatic
settlement which is feasible the region
could become an extremely dangerous
place effect a face with now move to
species destruction and LU clear war
you're finished
