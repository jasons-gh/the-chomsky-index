good afternoon good afternoon yeah all
right I'm going to keep it brief
professor Chomsky said he doesn't trust
what newspapers in any way so I should
spare the the appellate said he doesn't
trust poll numbers so I shouldn't site
the polls about unique the leading
public intellectual and so forth I keep
this just to a few minutes and turn it
over to our honored guests thank you for
being here today it's both a pleasure
and honor to welcome one of Boston's one
of the world's leading public
intellectuals and social activists here
to UMass Boston Boston's public
university emeritus professor of
linguistics and mighty Noam Chomsky is
author or co-author of over one hundred
and hundreds perhaps thousands of essays
and interviews extending from 1957 both
the syntactic structures the first in a
series of major works that would help to
revolutionize the field of linguistics
to his seminal 1967 FA the
responsibility of intellectuals where he
challenged his peers and colleagues in
academia and beyond to take a principled
stand against unjust government policies
even at great personal cost in general
and against the Vietnam War in
particular among these other classic
works and particularly valuable
memorable to me is his influential
co-authored manufacturing consent from
1988 co-author and carbon which offers a
rigorously empirical critique of modern
US matter
effectively a propaganda system for us
elite interests and government
priorities more recent texts include
best-selling critiques of u.s. foreign
policy including hegemony or survival in
2003 and rogue states recipient of
dozens of honorary degrees from across
the world professor Chomsky has been
prominently featured in over a dozen
documentary films and his facebook page
on the Facebook page someone set up to
honor him has over 1 million likes which
is to say not only has professor Chomsky
prolific intellectual work finally
influenced his particular academic field
it has reached a wide audience in ways
that few other us academics can say for
over 50 years he has been truly a public
intellectual and here i will mention a
couple of polls the Chomsky perhaps
would suggest not to trust them in 2005
a survey of scholars found that Chomsky
was the most influential living public
intellectual another study from night
from the mid-1990s found that he had
been cited scholarly work more often
than any other
living public intellectual between 1980
and 1992 and in fact was in the top five
for all scholars cited living or dead
the 86 will formally retired from
teaching at MIT for some time fessor
Chomsky continues going strong as one of
the most patient persistent and
preeminent teachers of our time as
listing off even a fraction of his
publications can easily fill the three
hours we have today I will simply refer
you to the Chomsky dot info website
kalki info where you can find links to
hundreds even thousands of essays books
interviews and more keeping up with
Chomsky's production itself is a
full-time job for today professor
Chomsky has selected the title the
common good threats and resistance he's
agreed to talk for approximately 45
minutes after which we will have
approximately the same amount of time
for Question and Answer and discussion
he said that he may let it go as long as
it's interesting so I trust you know ms
Boston students and faculty and workers
alike I'm sure you'll keep it
interesting if all goes well we have as
roommates in six we ask you whatever the
event does finish to join us for some
refreshments and light refreshments I
believe they're located in that corner
and to continue the conversation one
final but exciting note in the interest
of extending deepening and further
publicizing the intellectual exchange
that emerges here today the English
department the MFA Creative Writing
Program the Honors College and writ
large magazine have all co-sponsored a
common good writing contest for students
here at the University we are asking for
students whether graduate students or
undergraduates whether writing poetry
prose imaginary dialogue with the
honored professor to put now in writing
your most thoughtful responses today's
to today's talk and to the theme that
this talk takes as its title the common
good the extended prompt for that is
available if you would like it you can
have pliers in the back at the various
tables I encourage you to check out on
the way out today we also have at least
two or three sign-up sheets where it
says the common good writing contest and
discussion circle or network I encourage
you if you are interested in receiving
more information about the contest or
just want to attend to hear the readings
and hear those responses to put your
email or phone number down there so that
we can include you both for the content
itself and for an event in May again the
goal is to extend this dialogue so this
is not a one-off event if you're getting
of a dialogue that continues into the
spring and into the fall the summer as
well okay I think that's all I have
so sign up because we would like to
continue this conversation as your being
here testifies other many important
issues facing us in this world right now
and it's not nothing that no matter how
brilliant Chomsky is today those issues
are still being with us perhaps
clarified that still with us and I think
that you unite with this is the closing
sentiment which is I hope we can honor
his talk about the common good by doing
what we can together here UMass Boston
and beyond to bring that common good
into being despite whatever assaults we
make base in the process let's keep the
conversation going without any further
ado I'd like to introduce to you the man
who needs no introduction but got one
anyway professor Noam Chomsky
the assault that's mentioned in the
title is an ongoing one their hips and
flows but it's constant it's a form of
class war by the wealthy and the
powerful seeking to attain the Romans
that cost
everyone else it has different names at
different times it really took
period with Margaret Thatcher and it's
been
modern englert is neoliberalism which is
the misleading name that's a sister
devices to that she
fools the retention which are neither
who
particularly the
but since the standard name is new with
a little
he do it the
the neoliberal assault has been
worldwide harmful phones everywhere
except for the rich and powerful that is
surprising outcome a few words about you
know the roads and later on but the
target of the assault is human welfare
what is losing hope
worth spending few minutes that's what
that concept means has meant over the
years of contested notion of course
closed begins with an Enlightenment work
I think
the fundamental principle of the common

Pythons of classical liberalism and

institutions should be under complete
popular Democratic control no masters no
people following orders that's a
classical conception but not good the
core classical liberalism

century was quite common in the United
States as well but it was a lively and

natural resistant masters those who
follow work and they had it that they
hope that that day would be far distant

but I suspect that recognition of the
remaining character
it's not very far below the surface

but like the libertarian tradition
