Tonight at the University of Sydney, Professor Noam Chomsky
will be awarded Australia's only international prize for peace.
Last night, Noam Chomsky delivered
the City of Sydney Peace Prize Lecture
in the Sydney Town Hall.
Now, Noam Chomsky, as you know,
has been leading at least three very busy distinguished lives -
linguist, philosopher and political activist.
A great number of questions
were submitted to the Opera House for this session.
They fell into broadly a dozen categories,
and I'm going to put a question to Professor Chomsky in each category
that will attempt to reflect the thrust,
the main thrust, of your interests.
We will also try and take some questions from the floor later
in the interests of free speech.
Now, Noam Chomsky is institute professor and emeritus professor
in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT.
Among other things, that means that he can supervise PhDs in any faculty.
Hailed even by his critics
as arguably the most important intellectual alive,
he ranks with Marx, Shakespeare and the Bible
as one of the ten most quoted sources in the humanities.
In addition to his significant work
in linguistics and philosophy, though,
he is celebrated for his unfailing moral courage
and the inspiration and oxygen he has given globally
to the cause of peace with justice.
Please welcome the 2011 recipient of the Sydney Peace Prize, Noam Chomsky.
(APPLAUSE)
Welcome to Australia, Noam.
Glad to be here.
In your lecture last night, you essentially talked about
an integral part of what constitutes a civilised human being.
You said, "One of the great moral and universal responsibilities
"is to address injustice
"and the grievances that are at the heart of much violence,
"and in particular to cease to be complicit
"on crimes for which we share responsibility."
You also reminded us that our wealth
in no small measure derives from the tragedy of others,
that we support dictators when it suits us,
and happily set aside the rule of law when we've had a change of heart.
My question is this - how can we reconcile what you're advocating
with the three most frequently used words
to engender unquestionable public legitimacy,
"the national interest"?
Indeed, given that so many of our problems are global,
how are they to be tackled
when we are each protecting our national interests?
That's an interesting term, 'national interest'.
Of course, it's the core notion of
academic international relations theory,
so-called realist international theory,
international relations theories,
based on the concept that states pursue their national interest.
It's always seemed to me that the concept is very far from realistic -
in fact, has a touch of mysticism about it.
It assumes that there's a common national interest
shared by everyone in the country.
So the CEO of General Electric
and the janitor who cleans the floor
have the same interest.
Well, actually, they have very different interests,
often sharply conflicting interests.
It turns out that the interest of the CEO
is what ends up being the national interest,
not the janitor.
So it's a concept that relates to
elite conceptions of what's in their interest,
and if you look closely, that's the way it's actually used.
Well, there are some shared interests, of course,
like not being destroyed by, say,
destruction of the environment or by nuclear war.
Well, what about those interests? How do we protect them?
Suppose, for example, it was determined
that the Australian national interest, in this sense,
could be advanced
by enslaving the population of sub-Saharan Africa
and sending them to work under miserable conditions
in mines owned by Australian companies.
Suppose that that increased the wealth of Australia
and hence its national interest.
Should we - should you - therefore be in favour of it?
Well, I think if we took a vote among people of Australia,
very few would be in favour of it.
And I should say that this is not really a hypothetical example.
After the Second World War,
when the United States was in a position of just overwhelming power -
I won't go into the details,
but there's nothing like it in history, and planners knew it -
they made detailed, sophisticated plans to organise the world
so that it would serve what they took to be the American national interest.
They assigned every region of the world what they called its function.
So for example, the function of South-East Asia
was to provide resources
and raw materials for the former colonial powers
so that they could then reconstruct,
which was in the American national interest,
and be allies and purchase the US manufacturing surplus
which was enormous at the time and so on.
Well, as they went around the world...
This was incidentally George Kennan
and his policy planning staff at the State Department.
When they got to Africa, they decided
that the United States is not particularly interested in Africa,
but we are interested in the reconstruction of Europe,
so we will hand over Africa to the Europeans to exploit -
the term they used -
hand it over to the Europeans to exploit
to help in their reconstruction.
Well, these are the liberal democrats we're talking about.
George Kennan himself was considered so dovish
he was soon thrown out of the State Department,
considered too soft-hearted for this harsh world.
Well, do we accept that?
Thinking back, is it correct?
Would Americans then, even, have said that it's right
to hand over Africa to Europe to exploit for its reconstruction?
Not many would accept that, I hope, certainly not now.
And those are real issues.
If it turns out to be
in the so-called, mostly mythical, 'national interest'
to exploit, harm and destroy others, is that a conflict?
I mean, are we in a conflict about whether to accept it or not?
I don't really think so.
Noam, the election of Obama
engendered a lot of hope in the US and internationally.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
The Rambo-style execution of Osama bin Laden under a Democrat president
came as a disappointment and surprise - at least to some.
Guantanamo Bay hasn't been shut down.
Has the post-9/11 neoconservative agenda been more successful,
more entrenched and pervasive than you anticipated?
I frankly did not share the...
..hopefulness when Obama was elected.
I thought it was mostly illusion.
In fact, I wrote about it even before the primaries,
just basing myself on his record, his webpage and so on.
So it's not entirely afterthoughts.
Nevertheless, it was worse than I expected.
So I did not expect things like...
In many ways, it's worse than Bush's programs,
and that's been pointed out by conservative military analysts.
So for example... Take, say, Guantanamo Bay.
Bush's program was his way of dealing with suspects -
and let me stress 'suspects'.
There used to be a principle in Anglo-American legal tradition
that people are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
So the term 'suspect' is correct.
The Bush approach to suspects was to kidnap them,
send them to Bagram or Guantanamo - essentially torture chambers -
and keep them there without charges indefinitely.
That's pretty awful.
Why, incidentally, did they send them to Guantanamo
rather than to, say, Kansas?
Nothing to do with security. That's ridiculous.
It's because they anticipated that
Guantanamo would be regarded by the courts
as outside of the applicability of American laws.
Actually the Supreme Court, even the conservative Supreme Court,
disappointed them on that,
and did rule that they have
habeas corpus rights and so on - limited rights.
Well, that was the Bush program.
Kidnap suspects, no matter whether you know anything about them or not,
send them to torture chambers, and then maybe have military trials,
which are no trials at all.
Obama's expanded that.
He does the same things, but it's expanded.
Now the program is to assassinate suspects.
So there are several places in the world, quite a few by now,
in which people like us can be walking around the streets
wondering whether a minute from now
there's going to be a massive explosion
directed by someone halfway across the world -
a drone attack,
which is aimed at killing a suspect
and whoever else happens to be around,
so-called 'collateral damage', maybe us.
That's the Obama global assassination program,
and just in the last few weeks it's been extended a little beyond,
and for the first time got a little bit or criticism for this.
It was extended to purposeful assassination of American citizens.
It's the al-Awlaki case,
and another American citizen who happened to be collateral damage.
Well, that's a little bit of an extension.
There's an elite assumption that American citizens are human beings
and have certain rights.
Others are what are sometimes called 'un-people' -
a term of the British diplomatic historian Mark Curtis
in his discussions of the crimes of the British Empire.
So there are people and un-people, and the non-citizens are un-people,
so it's OK to assassinate them if they're suspects.
But people, it's a little expanding it beyond,
so a little criticism about that.
And in many other ways - I won't go through the details -
Obama has stretched violation of civil liberties
and also expanded war
to an extent beyond what I expected.
In fact, in Afghanistan, for example,
the US and its allies, like Australia,
now have forces well beyond the peak of Soviet forces
during their occupation of Afghanistan.
And in fact, last year was the most violent year in Afghanistan
since 2001.
It's not a pretty picture, and in many ways I think he's -
I won't go through further details -
has gone beyond at least what I expected
in pursuing pretty much the same agendas.
It's not the whole story.
I mean, there have been a few steps that I think are positive,
and better than would have taken place
under, say, a McCain administration.
Like he appointed quite a good Secretary of Labor,
and some of the labour laws
were beginning to be implemented a little bit,
and there were a few other things.
But in general, the picture is not pretty.
I think the strongest thing he has going for him,
and what may, in fact, win the election,
is just that the opposition is practically off the planet.
I don't know if you've been following this.
There's nothing like it
in the history of parliamentary democracy that I can think of.
And maybe for that reason he'll be re-elected
with maybe parts of his base voting for him.
But he's actually lost a large part of the base
that enthusiastically worked for him
and not just voted but organised and so on,
and are terribly disillusioned, and with justice.
We turn to Israel and Palestine,
and, of course, there are many issues that we could take up.
But let's look at prospects.
You've said that under Obama,
"the Palestinians will be offered fried chicken, nothing more."
What do you mean by that?
That phrase, 'fried chicken', is actually not mine.
It comes from the Netanyahu Administration.
In 1996, Shimon Peres was Prime Minister,
and he was then replaced by Benjamin Netanyahu in a vote in 1996.
In Peres's last press conference, he was asked,
"Will there ever be a Palestinian state?"
He said, "There'll never be a Palestinian state.
"We'll never permit it."
Now, actually, that wasn't well reported -
for an interesting reason.
He was actually giving a press conference to a group of
American correspondents - 'Newsweek' and others -
but there were some Israeli correspondents there too,
and you can read about it in the Israeli press, in the Hebrew press.
There was no translations at that time.
The reason it wasn't in the American press
is that in the middle of Peres's press conference,
news came through that a verdict was coming in the O.J. Simpson trial.
So all the American reporters scampered out of the room
to get the important news,
and Peres could make these comments
to a small number of Israeli reporters.
Well, that was the Peres Administration.
Then Netanyahu came in.
This was his first term. He's now in his second term.
And his information minister was asked
what did he think about whether there could be a Palestinian state?
And he answered, "Well," he said, "our plan is to leave
"a few fragments of the West Bank in Palestinian hands.
"We're not interested in them.
"We don't want to bother with the population.
"And if they want to call it a state, we don't mind,
"or they can call it fried chicken."
That's their conception of what a state would be.
And that's essentially the conception that Obama's adopted.
For 35 years, the United States has...
..almost unilaterally barred
a diplomatic negotiated settlement
of the Israel-Palestine conflict
along lines that are well-known,
and, in fact, accepted by virtually the entire world.
It's an overwhelming international consensus.
The basic form of it is a two-state settlement
on the internationally recognised border,
the pre-June '67 border,
and then this phrase,
from the formal US position in the early '70s,
when the US was still part of the world on this,
"with minor and mutual modifications" -
to cease fire lines, straighten it and so on.
So that's the international consensus,
and other provisions for other issues.
That was vetoed by the United States at the Security Council in 1976.
And I won't run through the record, but it stays about the same.
Obama has pushed it even further.
For example, his last veto, last February,
did get some international attention,
because he was actually vetoing a Security Council resolution
that called for the implementation of official US policy,
namely, barring settlement advancement,
which is, of course, illegal -
everyone agrees to that, even the state of Israel.
That was pretty extreme, so it got some notice.
In general, Obama has taken a position in many ways harsher
and more extreme than previous American presidents,
which is saying something.
Now, if you think about the current situation
and indeed the role of Australia,
there's a sort of a standard conventional view
that the United States has been kind of an honest broker
desperately trying to bring together
two recalcitrant opponents - Israel and the Palestinians,
Palestinians being the guilty ones most of the time -
and trying to reach a settlement.
It's just totally untrue.
If there were meaningful negotiations proceeding,
they would be organised by some neutral party.
Pick it as you wish - maybe Brazil,
a respected state that's fairly neutral.
And on one side would be the United States and Israel,
on the other side would be the rest of the world,
almost without exception.
Well, the United States and its allies
don't want honest negotiations.
They want negotiations which meet a variety of crucial preconditions.
Now, again, the conventional view is
the Palestinians are asking for preconditions
and Israel wants just negotiations, and of course the US is neutral.
But if you look at it closely, it's the US and Israel
who are imposing strict preconditions, and important ones.
One is that it has to be run by the United States.
Well, yeah, that's run by
an extremist rejectionist state
which has been blocking a settlement for 35 years.
So that's precondition one.
The second precondition is that Israel must have the right
to continue expanding settlements.
That's a precondition, and it's a precondition...
Again, I stress it's not in dispute
that the settlements themselves are illegal,
and certainly expansion of them is multiply so.
Expansion in what's called Jerusalem - vastly expanded region -
annexed by Israel, that's doubly illegal.
Today's announcements, for example.
It's doubly illegal because it's also in violation of
explicit Security Council demands
that nothing be done to change the status of Jerusalem.
Goes back to 1968.
In fact the US, which at that time was part of the world,
voted with everyone.
Unanimous vote, so it's doubly illegal.
But that's a precondition.
Furthermore, Israel has made it clear -
you can read it in today's papers -
that the expansion is proceeding
in regions which will be annexed to Israel.
Illegally, of course. Well, that's a further precondition.
They're already establishing the borders officially
which they're going to illegally annex.
That's another precondition.
Under those conditions, preconditions,
everyone who has a grey cell functioning,
and certainly the Palestinians, can see that nothing will happen.
Negotiations of this kind can go on indefinitely
while Israel, with US support -
diplomatic, military, economic support -
simply takes over what's left of the...
..what they don't want in the West Bank,
and let the population sort of rot in these fragments,
and it'll be a kind of fried chicken.
If they want to call it a state, OK.
Also, the US and Israel insist that it be separated from Gaza.
That's been US-Israeli policy since the early '90s,
in explicit violation of the Oslo agreements
which insist that Gaza and the West Bank are a single territorial entity.
But Israel and the United States
have been trying hard to separate them since the early 90s -
an interesting story, I don't have time to go into it here,
but you should know about it - and the reasons are pretty obvious.
That means that if any fragments are left to Palestinians in the West Bank
they'll be completely imprisoned with no access to the outside world.
They'll be imprisoned between
the regions annexed to Israel in the West Bank,
Israel and the Jordanian dictatorship.
Gaza would be the only access to the outside,
so of course it has to be separated.
Those are the preconditions, and you can understand...
You can ask whether the Palestinian Authority
made a wise or an unwise tactical move
in trying to approach the United Nations to get around this,
but it's perfectly understandable that they would seek some way
to get around the farcical negotiations of this kind
with their obvious consequences.
Noam, have a drink
because I'd like to move on to talking about money next.
-About? -Money.
Money, OK. We're getting crass.
Wealth, wealth.
(LAUGHTER)
Seems that the simple narrative... has been
that it's in all our interests that the rich get richer
because that's how they create more jobs for the rest of us.
Is the Occupy Wall Street movement
a sign that there's a widespread shift in that perception?
Where do you think the movement will go?
What impact do you think it will have?
Well, first of all we should ask about this perception.
That is the perception of the media, the corporate boardrooms,
the editorial boards, elite opinion - established elite opinion.
Certainly not the general population.
It's certainly not the view of the general population.
The United States is a very heavily polled society, and for good reasons.
It's a business-run society.
Business wants to keep its finger on the public pulse.
That's how you know how to run the propaganda, advertising, so on.
So we know a lot about public opinion in the United States,
and the careful polls are worth looking at -
not all of them, but a lot of them are.
The population overwhelmingly disagrees with this,
and has for a long time.
So right now, for example,
the population overwhelmingly thinks that
first of all, that the deficit is not the serious problem -
it's a minor one -
joblessness is.
But if you pay attention to the deficit,
the way to deal with it is higher taxes on the wealthy
and preserving social benefits.
The decision of the bipartisan commission's
probably going to be the opposite.
But that's part of the huge gap between public opinion and policy
which lies at the basis of the anger and frustration
that's just sweeping over the country.
So first of all, it's not the public perception,
and secondly, the public is correct.
That's not the way jobs come.
And we see it right in front of us at this minute.
I mean, corporate profits are reaching records.
They don't know what to do with their money.
Are they creating jobs? No, they're not creating jobs.
Maybe they're creating jobs in northern Mexico
or in China where you can... labour's cheap and can be exploited,
and people can be treated brutally,
but they're not doing it in the United States.
In fact, it's worth noticing
if you read the business press carefully,
you'll notice that there are signs
that corporate investment might come back to the United States.
The reason is that working conditions and wages
in the Southern states like, say, Mississippi, are becoming so rotten
that they can actually maybe begin to compete with
Foxconn's kind of prison camps in China
where people work under horrendous conditions.
So maybe jobs will come back.
Now, that's the way putting money in the pockets of the rich
might create jobs.
Furthermore, just to make it clear
that this is not just a temporary phenomenon,
there was a period not that long ago
of very extensive economic growth in the United States -
in fact, much of the world -
the '50s and the '60s,
when it was still basically under
sort of New Deal-style social democratic structures.
That was the period of the greatest growth in American history,
and the taxes on the rich were far higher than they are now.
But there was economic growth for many reasons -
large part of it, state intervention.
But it was real, it was extensive.
If you're a businessman who wants to invest,
you might invest if there's demand.
But you don't invest because you have money in your pocket.
I mean, everyone knows that.
This is just an elite myth which has been concocted,
and which the population has never accepted, rightly.
The Occupy Movement, yes, it's expressing it,
but I don't really think it's a shift.
The shift is that public opinion is finally reaching...
..having some kind of an expression in organised activity.
Well, how far can this go?
It's an important question.
It's, in my view, an extremely important movement.
It's the first large-scale active response
to 30 years of
what's called neoliberal globalisation
which have been a disaster for just almost everywhere
where these concepts have been applied,
and the United States as well.
It's a worse disaster in Egypt or Mexico,
but it's a disaster in the United States too.
People are angry about it, upset about it.
They haven't had a voice in the political system
or certainly not in the media -
maybe a few marginal people.
And now there's an active, engaged popular movement
that's beginning to express those concerns, and might go on -
we'll see.
It'll obviously meet a strong backlash of repression.
That's predictable.
If it can withstand it and overcome it,
it could be of historic significance.
You mentioned growth,
and that's another term that has a terrific ring to it.
I mean, what could be bad about growth?
We don't challenge the notion that growth is good.
But are we breeding and consuming our way to extinction?
And what's it going to take for us
to recalibrate our expectations in a finite world?
Well, first of all, again, we should be careful to think about consumerism
and the consumption culture.
That's to a large extent artificially created -
and not my opinion.
Go back say a century
to the origins of the public relations industry,
including the advertising industry.
It's an interesting history.
Back around a century ago, in the freest countries in the world,
England and the United States, there was a recognition -
conscious, articulated recognition on elite sectors -
that enough freedom has been won by popular struggle
so that people can't be controlled by force anymore.
So there'd have to be other ways to control them,
and the other way to control them is control of attitudes and opinions.
That's when you get the call for manufacture of consent
on the part of progressive intellectuals -
the Wilsonian, Roosevelt progressives and so on.
We have to have manufacture of consent.
But we also have to have creation of wants.
People have to be driven to the more superficial things of life,
like fashionable consumption -
actually, I'm quoting from the business press -
because that way we can control people.
If we can fabricate wants -
the term used by the great political economist Thorstein Veblen,
who understood this and wrote about it...
If we can fabricate wants, create wants, we can trap people.
We can trap people into consumerism, debt, and so on.
And it's very interesting the way this was done.
If there was time, I could go into it.
To a large extent, we live in a society in which
enormous resources are devoted to fabricating wants.
I mean, if you take a look at...
I presume it's the same here as in the United States.
If you look at television directed to infants, 2-year-olds,
it's already trying to create
a culture of demand - demand goods.
In fact, there's now an academic discipline,
part of applied psychology,
which is concerned with nagging, literally.
The reason is
the advertising industry recognised a couple of decades ago
that there's a big part of the population
that doesn't have any money,
so they can't buy,
so we gotta do something to make them buy - that's children -
and the way they can buy is by nagging their parents.
"I gotta have that video cam," whatever it is.
And so the advertising aimed at children, television and so on,
devises various types of nagging
that could be used for different kinds of purchases.
Well, the point is...the idea is to trap infants, children
into a culture of fabricated wants
so they can then be trapped into a consumer culture,
and then they can be effectively controlled,
along with manufacturing of opinions.
All very conscious, incidentally.
There's some quite good studies of this, if you're interested.
One very good book by a Canadian law professor, Joel Bakan,
has just come out.
I forget what it's called -
something about stealing childhood or something like that.
It's a very concerted effort.
But quite apart from that, suppose we are to some extent trapped in it.
How do we react to the fact
that of course, as you say, it's a finite world, finite resources,
we're going to hit limits.
Well, there's two ways. One is the way of the lemmings.
We just march happily toward the cliff,
and then when it turns out there's a cliff,
we go over it and we're finished.
Well, that's one way to react,
and that's what the business world is driving us to
for the purposes of short-term profit.
But they're going to fall off too.
They'll fall off too, but you don't think about that if you're...
Literally.
So for example, in the United States,
quite openly, the Chamber of Commerce, the main business lobby,
American Petroleum Institute and others, are very openly -
they say it - organising propaganda efforts
to convince people that global warming is a liberal myth.
And it's affected popular opinion.
You can see the polls reacting as the campaign continues.
Now, the people who are running this campaign,
as individuals, probably share your attitudes.
Maybe they're members of the Sierra Club,
and they contribute to environmental programs.
But in the capacity of a CEO of a corporation,
you have a duty that you must perform.
If you don't perform it, you're out and someone else is in.
This is an institutional property. Much harder to deal with.
The property is you have to maximise short term profit and market share.
In fact, that's a legal requirement in Anglo-American law.
If you don't do that, you're displaced and somebody else comes in.
So there's an institutional imperative to destroy the planet,
to march off the cliff.
That's a serious problem.
It traces back to well-known inefficiencies of market systems
which you can probably learn about in your first economics course.
They ignore externalities, technically,
and that's a built-in institutional property.
And it does lead to the leaders of the lemmings
knowing that they're going to fall off the cliff too.
But we don't have to be lemmings.
I mean, we can deal with these problems sensibly.
Consuming more of the world's resources
is the advertising industry's image of happiness,
but it doesn't have to be ours,
and I think any sensible person knows that it isn't.
It makes me think we're not coming across as being very smart here.
I do want to get onto the brain, but before we do that,
can we talk about WikiLeaks for a moment?
Julian Assange has lost his extradition appeal.
Recently, our prime minister dismissed him on a public broadcaster
as "just anarchic".
The implication is that all sensible people know
anarchism is ridiculous and irresponsible.
Common sense, right?
Depends what you mean by 'anarchism'.
If you mean by 'anarchism' the media image,
which goes back to the late 19th century,
'anarchism' just means people running wild, breaking windows and so on.
OK, and that conception of anarchism, I would agree.
But there's another conception which is the actual conception,
which is the core of traditional anarchist thought and activism.
It goes back to the Enlightenment, in fact.
Literally, it comes pretty much out of
the origins of classical liberalism,
which one great anarchist thinker, Rudolf Rocker -
anarcho-syndicalist analyst - argued, and I think with some plausibility,
that classical liberalism which grew out of Enlightenment ideals -
and, incidentally, is rather different
when you actually read Adam Smith, from the imagery that's concocted -
but the classical liberal ideas, as he put it,
ran aground on the reefs of capitalism.
It was blocked by capitalism, couldn't survive capitalism.
And he argues that his particular strain of anarchism,
anarcho-syndicalism,
was the natural outgrowth of classical liberalism
in an age where you have to overcome
the barriers introduced by the rise of capitalism,
later corporate capitalism.
And I think there's some sense to that.
The core of the anarchist tradition, which again has Enlightenment roots,
is to raise questions about
authority, hierarchy and domination,
and to point out that they're not self-justifying,
whatever structure they are.
You know, master/slave,
patriarchal husband/obedient wife,
imperial power dominating the world.
Whatever the structure of authority is,
it is not self-justifying and it should be challenged.
And if it cannot justify itself, it should be dismantled.
That's a core principle of anarchism.
In that sense, I think everyone should be an anarchist.
And if you look at the...
(APPLAUSE)
Notice I say, "If it cannot be justified."
I think there are cases where justification can be given.
So just to take a personal example.
I once - only once, thankfully -
slapped my little daughter on her hand.
She didn't like it. You can ask her now what she thinks about it.
She's grown up. Now she slaps my hand.
But the occasion was when she was about three years old.
And we had an electric stove.
And as you know, the grills or whatever they're called,
they stay hot after they turn black,
and she was reaching to put her hand on the stove.
So I grabbed her hand and slapped it - one and only time.
I think that was...
..you can give a justification for that.
But it takes effort to justify.
It was an act of authority, of course.
You have to work pretty hard
to justify structures of authority and domination.
Usually they're not self-justifying,
and as moral consciousness expands,
which I think it does over time,
there have been repeated challenges to these structures -
in our own lifetimes, in fact.
And I think they're moves in the right direction.
And that's the basic anarchist conception.
It leads on to a conception of social order
in which voluntary free association,
creative work under one's own control and so on
assume major proportions and revise the nature of the society.
Actually, these questions are coming up in the Occupy Movements
for long-range commitments,
and I think that's good -
that's the way the social moral evolution should go.
I don't think Julia's here, but she might listen to the podcast.
Moving on to...
..media free speech and democracy, Noam,
it's probably fair to say that there's probably
no support among media organisations for more regulation.
You're a great advocate of free speech,
you've also written about media bias.
But given the critical role of media in a democracy,
why shouldn't the general news and comment media
be subjected to the same requirement as public broadcasters
to provide balance?
So if a public broadcaster is lined up in a spectrum of other media,
many pumping out redneck propaganda, where's the level playing field?
Isn't this an example of where
freedoms, in fact, lead to a lack of diversity,
and indeed undermine democratic principles?
And in the end, isn't it in fact money that's doing the talking?
Money is, of course, doing the talking.
That's inherent, and what I was just talking about.
For example, fabrication of a consumer culture.
That's manufacture of consent.
That's money talking - no secret about it.
As for balance in public media,
I can't comment on Australia, but I'll talk about the United States.
There is a kind of balance in the public media.
They're different than, say, Fox News.
On the other hand, the balance is of a very specific kind,
which is actually taught in journalism schools.
So if you go to one of the better
journalism schools in the United States,
you're taught a concept of objectivity,
how you can be an objective reporter.
You're an objective reporter and an honest reporter
if you report accurately what's going on...
..the phrase is "inside the beltway", meaning inside Washington circles.
If you report that accurately - you say
"The Democrats say this, the Republicans say that," and so on,
that's balanced.
It happens, if you look, that that balance excludes the opinions,
and often the overwhelming opinions, of the large majority of the public.
I gave an example, and it's not the only one by any means.
There's an enormous gap between public opinion and public policy.
An objective reporter -
and balance in the public media -
is to present the views of elite sectors accurately.
Again, "Democrats say this, Republicans say that."
If the large majority of the population is against it all,
that would be subjective, biased and so on if you presented it.
So I think there are questions to raise about the notion of balance,
which is not...
But turning to your actual question,
it's certainly true that money is going to talk.
Personally, I'd be against efforts to regulate that.
Because where would the regulation be coming from?
Well, it would be coming from state power.
But I think we should be very cautious about assigning the state
the power to determine what's said and what isn't said.
I think we have to go after the core problem
which is the fact that money is talking.
The fact that there's such a disparity of wealth and power
that a democratic system simply can't function properly
and that shows up at every point.
For example, the United States in the last 30 years
has become rather extreme in this respect,
but it's an extreme version of something that exists generally.
So for example, now and for the last roughly 30 years,
in the United States - the Reagan, Thatcher, neoliberal period -
elections, increasingly, are simply bought.
Literally, you can predict the outcome of an election quite well
by just looking at the amount of campaign spending.
And you can predict the policies that are pursued
by asking about where that campaign spending comes from.
So it should surprise no-one that Obama, despite his nice talk,
is essentially pursuing the policies of a small financial elite.
That's where his funding came from,
it's where it's going to come from in the next election.
Actually, this goes back very far.
There's good studies of it by fine political economists.
But it's been very sharply exaggerated
in the neoliberal structures.
Not just in the United States, everywhere.
By now it's reached the point where even in Congress,
the old traditions of parliamentary functioning
have been pretty much dissolved.
So it used to be the case
that someone in Congress would get a position of influence,
say, chair of a committee, on the basis of seniority and performance.
A lot of questions about that, but at least that was the idea.
That's been pretty much thrown to the winds.
If you want a committee chair at this point,
you have to buy it from the party.
You have to put money in the party coffers.
Then maybe you'll get the chair.
That simply drives members of Congress
into the pockets of the corporate sector,
by now mostly the financial sector,
and further erodes democracy.
And what you describe in the media is part of that.
Incidentally, it holds with not just the media.
I do write about the media.
But personally, I don't think it's very different
from the general intellectual community.
If you look at the elite media, you know, the opinion...
Sometimes called the agenda-setting media.
The ones that provide the framework that smaller newspapers adhere to -
you know, 'New York Times', CBS News and so on.
I don't think there's much difference
between their conceptions and their boundaries
and those that you find in, say, the academic world.
They share the same general academic culture.
It's easier to study the media than to study scholarship,
because it's just easier to carry out careful analyses
and so on and so forth.
But I've done a lot on this.
I've written a lot about it if you're interested.
But I don't think it's very different.
And it all reflects to a substantial extent
the actual distribution of power in the society.
That's an observation that's considered radical,
but it's as old as Adam Smith.
I mean, Adam Smith was not the caricature
that you read about in elementary school.
Smith, for example, recognised
that in England, the England of his day,
the people who basically owned the society,
the merchants and manufacturers...
He said, "They are the principal architects of government policy,
"and they design policy so that their own interests are very well served
"however grievous the impact on others,
"including the people of England."
Well, you know, this is 'Wealth of Nations', 1770s,
and that's basically correct.
Now it's not merchants and manufacturers,
it's multinational corporations,
you know, investment firms and so on.
But the same principle holds,
and it holds increasingly in an exaggerated form.
Under the impact of neoliberal ideology,
to an almost grotesque form.
These are real problems, deep social problems.
And I think we have to go after those
rather than calling on state efforts
to regulate speech and publication.
We better talk about the brain, Noam, before we run out of time.
So, what I'd like to know is
why the study of how we acquire language was important to you,
and what has it revealed to us in a broad sense about how the mind works?
Well, traditionally, the capacity for language
has been understood to be
almost a defining property of the human species.
If you go back...
Say take Cartesian philosophy, 17th century -
the dominant philosophy out of which grew the Enlightenment and so on.
For Descartes, it literally was the defining property.
Remember, for Descartes it was critical to distinguish
creatures with minds - souls or minds -
from those who didn't have them.
The ones who didn't have souls and minds were machines.
That was the mechanical philosophy
that was the basis for early modern science.
They were machines. Those with souls and minds were human.
Well, how would you determine whether some creature has a mind?
The proposals that come from Descartes and his followers were
"By testing their language abilities."
You ask,
"Do they have this fundamental creative capacity
"that humans have,
"and that they exhibit in their normal use of language?"
What's the creative capacity?
I think they captured the essence of it pretty accurately.
It's the ability which all humans share -
and according to them, no animal or machine shares -
to create and produce freely
new expressions which are appropriate to situations,
but not caused by situations.
They're not the result of stimuli coming from the outside
or for that matter even internal stimuli.
There's a big difference between being caused and being appropriate.
It's a crucial difference. A hard one to capture, but we recognise it.
And this innovative behaviour has no limits.
It can go on indefinitely.
In fact, most linguistic performances, new sentences,
maybe never produced in the history of the world,
or your own experience at least.
And they're also intelligible to others who recognise,
"I could have expressed that thought in that way if it had come to mind."
Well, that capacity, the sort of creative aspect of language use,
it was regarded, and I think plausibly,
as a kind of a core component of human cognition,
human morality, moral judgment
and, in fact, human activity.
This was connected, especially in the early days of classical liberalism -
people like Smith, von Humboldt and others...
This was connected with the belief that humans basically have a need,
a fundamental need to carry out
creative work under their own control.
This was put very nicely by Wilhelm von Humboldt,
the founder of the modern university system,
also a great linguist, and one of the founders of classical liberalism.
His point was...
The way he put it is that
if an artisan creates a beautiful piece of work on command,
we may admire what he did, but we despise what he is -
namely, a tool in the hands of others.
On the other hand, if that artisan produces the same beautiful work
under his own control and initiative,
we admire not only the piece of work
but also the artisan himself, who it is.
Actually, Adam Smith said the same thing.
Everyone has read the first paragraph of 'Wealth of Nations'
where, you know, talks about the butcher does this
and the baker does that and everybody's happy.
It comes out in favour of division of labour.
Very few people have gone on a couple hundred pages
into this rather dense book
when Smith returns to the notion of division of labour
and says that division of labour cannot be tolerated
because it will turn people into creatures
as stupid and ignorant as a human being can possibly be
just routinely under command
performing the same actions over and over.
And he says in any civilised society,
the government's going to have to step in to do something about it -
education, other things.
If you take a look at the scholarly editions of 'Wealth of Nations',
the University of Chicago bicentennial scholarly edition -
when you take a look under 'division of labour',
you'll notice this passage isn't even listed in the index,
the most important passage about division of labour.
I'm sure it was not intended deceit,
I think they just couldn't understand it.
It's just an unintelligible view in the modern conception.
You kind of read the words but they don't get beyond the eyes.
But that conception is really fundamental to classical liberalism.
I think it's correct.
They related it loosely to the creative aspect of language use.
Well, we're very far from having answers
to any of these questions, I should say.
But there are steps towards it,
and the major steps do happen to be in the study of language.
There are applications, thoughts about it elsewhere,
but that's where the main work is.
And some rather surprising things have come out, I think.
It's sort of useful to compare
what's been done in the last roughly 60 years
to the very early days of modern science.
One of the great breakthroughs in modern science,
let's say the Galilean period,
was to be willing to be puzzled about things that seemed obvious.
That's a tremendous step forward.
For example, for literally thousands of years,
it had been accepted by important scientists
that we have answers to some very simple questions.
Like, when I hold this thing up,
if I let it go, the cup's going to drop.
If this happened to be boiling water inside,
and I lift the lid, the steam will go up.
So the cup drops and the steam rises.
Well, Aristotle had an answer to why.
"They're seeking their natural place."
And that was taken to be the appropriate answer
for thousands of years.
Galileo and others said, "Let's be puzzled about this,
"let's just not take it for granted because it comes from authority."
And when you start being puzzled about it, modern science begins.
You see you don't know the answers,
and when you try to find out the answers, they break down -
it shows all sorts of intuitions are just wildly off -
and finally, out of this slowly comes modern science.
And I think that's what's been happening in the study of language
since roughly the early 1950s, approximately.
A lot of things that seem completely obvious were looked at carefully,
and they all turned out to be extremely puzzling.
So take a simple example,
which has kind of evolved in industry of analysis.
Take the sentence - short sentence...
.."Can eagles that fly swim?"
OK, we all understand it.
We know that the word 'can' is associated with 'swim', not 'fly'.
We're asking "Can they swim?" not "Can they fly?"
Similarly, we can say things like "Are eagles that fly swimming?"
But we can't say "Are eagles that flying swim?"
Actually, if you think about it, that's a fine thought.
It says "Are the eagles that are flying swimming too?"
So "Are eagles that flying swim?"
But you just can't say it that way.
That thought can't be expressed in that form.
Well, if you think about it,
it was taken for granted forever
that that was just intuitively obvious.
But if you think about it, it's not at all obvious.
Aristotle defined language as 'sound with meaning'.
Well, what the pursuit of this inquiry tends to show
is that that's not correct,
that actually language is meaning with sound.
And it need not be sound -
it can be sign or some other mode of externalisation.
That's a big difference.
It means that the core character of language
is the set of principles that yield structured expressions
and assign them a meaning.
And that part of language is probably...
We can't show it yet, but it looks like it's uniform among humans.
It doesn't seem to vary much, and if we knew enough, maybe at all.
It's just a core property of humans that we have this set of principles
that yields an unbounded array of structural expressions
that have a semantic interpretation that mean something,
and when you look into it, it's pretty strange what it means.
But that just seems to be shared among humans altogether.
There's no known difference among remote tribes in Papua
who haven't had other human contact for tens of thousands of years
and children who grew up here.
If you interchange them at infancy,
they'll grow into their own society without any problem.
So that seems to be a core property of human nature.
The externalisation - what we call the sound part - is marginal,
and it also follows from that that communication is marginal.
I mean, it's kind of like a dogma
among...even scientists who write about these topics
that language is basically a means of communication
and evolved as a means of communication.
You look at current publications on evolution of language,
that's just taken for granted.
It apparently is all false.
It turns out that from the closer analysis of language,
it's actually a tool for thought.
It's a means of expressing thought.
And on the side, you can use it for communication,
as you can use anything else for communication.
Actually, if you just introspect for a minute,
that shouldn't be surprising.
Just ask yourself what is most of your own use of language?
Well, if you introspect, it turns out
that probably 99% percent of it is talking to yourself.
Talking to yourself is not communicating.
It takes a tremendous act of will not to talk to yourself.
-(LAUGHTER) -Try it. You know, it's very hard.
You're walking down the street,
you're talking to yourself in fragments of sentences.
It goes on all night, unfortunately.
(LAUGHTER)
And sometimes it's used for communication
but even the external part is not much.
Well, that's a radically different conception
of fundamental human nature,
and it does lead to other directions
like at least exploring these thoughts about creative work,
about moral judgments and so on.
I think... I don't want to exaggerate.
This is by no means universally accepted, even among scientists,
but I think that's the direction in which work has been moving.
And I think it is a way of finding out
basic things about what kind of creatures we are.
Noam, thank you, but we are running out of time,
and a decision has to be made.
There's so much left to ask you.
We haven't spoken about a universal moral grammar,
we haven't spoken about free will, the existence of free will,
and I also want to know what the sources of your own inspiration are.
But we also need to take questions from the floor.
So I propose a referendum.
We have 10 minutes left.
Would you like us to continue with these questions or...
(APPLAUSE)
OK, those who object?
(SILENCE)
OK, alright. Thank you. Noam, just quickly...
-(WOMAN SHOUTS INAUDIBLY) -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
I didn't hear that, sorry.
WOMAN: Questions from the floor.
Oh, look, I'm sorry,
but I think you know being a democracy, you've been outvoted.
Maybe Professor Chomsky will take one from you personally at the end.
Would you be happy with that?
(SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE)
So just quickly, Noam, if possible, please,
you're an institute professor
at the most distinguished engineering institute in the world.
Can you comment briefly about the role of elite academic institutions?
They don't appear to be very radical places,
but you've been there now for over half a century.
Can they contribute to social change or are they a barrier to change?
Well, my own institution's a good example.
It is, I think it's fair to say,
the greatest engineering, science-based university
in the world,
and it was back in the 1950s when I got there.
In the 1950s, first of all, it was almost entirely Pentagon-funded.
But contrary to what a lot of people believe, that was the freest period.
The Pentagon didn't care what you were doing.
During the 1960s, the laboratory in which I worked
was 100% funded by the three armed services.
It was also the centre of anti-war resistance.
I don't mean protest, I mean resistance.
That meant support for deserters, tax resistance -
technically criminal activities.
I was coming up for a long jail sentence.
Other colleagues were involved in this too.
It was all coming out of the same...
It was the main academic centre in the country on this.
It was coming from the same laboratory
that was 100% funded by the three armed services.
That has to do with a fact about the advanced economies,
which is pretty well understood by participants - engineers -
and doesn't seem to be well understood
by economists or the general public,
and that is that the modern economy
depends very heavily on massive state intervention.
If you use a computer, the internet, satellites, microelectronics,
the IT revolution and so on,
you're feeding off of public funding and public initiative.
The Pentagon understood that.
It was the funnel for raiding the taxpayer under false pretences.
You know, "The Russians are coming."
So it wasn't democratic at all.
But it was essentially telling the public
"You pay us, we're going to create the technology of the future."
They didn't say that, but that's what was happening.
So they didn't really care what you were doing.
You want to overthrow the government, that's your business.
Just do your work.
But although that was the fact,
it was a very small part of the institute.
Most of the institute was extremely conventional.
People did their work, they didn't ask questions,
you just developed science and technology.
You know, this Tom Lehrer song about Wernher von Braun
which you may know -
"The rockets go up, where they come down is not my business."
That was essentially the conception.
Well, there was a small group of students - very small,
maybe a dozen or so in the 1960s
who began to be caught up in the general student activism of the 60s
and worked quite hard to try to change the atmosphere.
I won't go through the details, but they succeeded -
succeeded to the point that by the end of the '60s, '69,
it got to the point where actually the administration called a day off
just to focus on seminars, discussions, talks, and so on
about the uses of technology.
Should we be concerned with how science and technology are used?
And a lot of self-criticism came out of that.
Quite important groups formed - Union of Concerned Scientists and so on.
It just changed the atmosphere of the place,
and by now, those are common attitudes.
What was once "You just do your work and shut up"
has become "We have to think about what we're doing and why."
That expands into other forms of social activism too
in all sorts of ways.
I mean, one very dramatic change at MIT,
you can just see it walking down the halls.
When I got up there, in the '50s,
it was white - all white - male,
well-dressed, conventional, "Do your work."
You walk down the halls today, it's like universities elsewhere.
Half women, a third minorities, informal dress -
which is not insignificant, that means informal relationships -
and a lot of activism.
Those are quite big changes.
They came about largely through
the activism of small groups of students -
a couple of faculty, but mostly students -
who just essentially organised the place through their own activities.
A lot of interesting actions took place which changed things.
So, what is a university?
Well, you know, it depends on the people in it.
These are very free institutions in many ways.
A lot of things wrong with them - I don't want to exaggerate.
But among the institutions of the society,
these are perhaps the most free.
And that's particularly true of the sciences.
In the sciences, you just can't institute external controls
and expect them to survive.
You could see that in the old Soviet Union.
Biology couldn't survive under external controls.
The sciences are based on...
They're basically anarchist, in the sense that I was describing before.
Students are expected, in a good scientific university or courses...
They're not expected to just repeat what they were told.
They're expected to challenge.
In fact, a lot of the new ideas and innovation comes from that.
So a student's expected to say "I don't believe what you're saying,
"and here's an argument to the contrary."
That's good. That's what you try to encourage.
And if you didn't try to encourage that, the sciences would die.
So there's a built-in dynamic that kind of frees them up.
It doesn't mean that they're going to go to the point of raising questions
about the use of technology and science.
No, they didn't, and in fact there are classic crazed examples of this
which people should think about.
Take, say, creating the atom bomb.
There were two main institutions in the United States -
Chicago and Los Alamos.
Chicago, they were basically constructing the materials.
In Los Alamos, they were turning it into a weapon.
Now, you go to places like Chicago and Los Alamos,
they had some of the most outstanding intellectuals in the world.
These were, many of them, European emigres who were Einstein types.
Very impressive people -
cultured, literate, many of them what we would call pretty radical,
interested in music, the arts, thinking about things.
They were working in closed environments,
in which about the only thing that they pursued
was how to carry out huge, massive destruction in Japan -
they were pretty sure they were never going to use it in Germany -
in Japan, which might end the human race,
because they weren't really sure.
And it was a single-minded pursuit of that objective.
Now, if you look closely, the first protests, questioning,
came out of Chicago, not Los Alamos.
And the reason was that the Chicago phase of the operation
was completed earlier.
They were providing the materials,
and, of course, that was prior to turning it into a weapon.
It wasn't until their phase of the scientific activities was over
that some of them began to raise questions about
"What in the heck are we doing?"
You know, things like the Pugwash movement and so on grew out of that.
At Los Alamos, it didn't happen until after the bomb went off, literally.
When they began reflecting about it later,
there was a lot of justified self-criticism.
Here you had the most amazing group of intellectuals you could imagine -
lots of broad interests, all sorts of things -
and they were single-mindedly pursuing
highly dangerous, maybe potentially lethal activities,
not just for the victims but even beyond, without thinking about it.
Well, that can happen too.
And the question about what a university can be
or what academic life or free intellectual life can be,
these questions always arise.
You can get caught in what was called 'the sweetness of the problem'.
"It's a sweet problem - we really want to solve it."
You can easily get caught up in that, or you can ask "What am I doing?
"What's the purpose of it?
"What's the right way
"to distribute your energies in the world, and in life?"
There's a lot to say about that,
so I don't think there's a simple answer to your question.
-No, and... -(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
My next question was about free will, and I've been contemplating
how I can possibly turn it into a multiple choice
where the answer's either yes or no,
but I don't think that's going to work, folks.
So I think that's where we're going to have to leave it.
I'd like to thank all of you for coming.
I'd like to thank the many of you who sent in questions.
I'd like to thank the inimitable Professor Stuart Rees,
his executive officer Dr Hannah Middleton,
Dr Peter Slezak, Dr Clinton Fernandes,
who is a fountain of knowledge
and his generosity knows no bounds.
And of course I'd like to thank Professor Noam Chomsky.
I know that
you would not travel to Australia for some time
because you were taking care of your wife at home,
and in times when we have
outsourced caring for our dying loved ones,
I think that is the ultimate act of humanity in personal life.
You continue to be a beacon for how to live. Thank you.
NOAM: Thank you.
-Thank you, Noam. -Thanks for chairing that.
