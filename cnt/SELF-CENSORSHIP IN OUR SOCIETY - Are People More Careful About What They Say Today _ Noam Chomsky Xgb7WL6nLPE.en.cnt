talk to me about self-censorship uh are
we seeing
more of that these days with again the
kind of the populist
online culture or where we're all
self-censoring more than we even know we
are
um have you seen that change or is that
also something that's been around for a
very long time
well there's a kind of it's kind of a
mixed story
so what's this there's a difference
between
self-censorship just out of fear
and self-censorship out of sensitivity
so if i see uh suppose i see a
you know some a black man outside
and i call him boy i wouldn't do that
okay but that's not self-censorship
that's being a decent honest sane human
being
if somebody sees me and says hey kite
come over here
i don't think they should say that okay
they're not self-censoring
they're again just behaving with minimal
decency
but this has changed until not too long
ago
in the united states so let's go back to
the
1930s when i was a kid i remember
a article lead article in the major
business journal forbes magazine
lead article on the front page big
headline
the whops are unwhopping themselves
there's an article saying the trains are
running on time in mussolini in
italy the waps are unwhopping themselves
okay people wouldn't do that now
i hope not because there's a law against
it
but because consciousness has changed
the same with
the jokes about uh you know it was
normal
for people to make what they thought
were funny jokes about
niggers you know blacks you know okay
is that self-censorship i mean
there are cases where it can go too far
but sensitivity
to the feelings of others and
treating people with dignity and respect
is not self-censorship
