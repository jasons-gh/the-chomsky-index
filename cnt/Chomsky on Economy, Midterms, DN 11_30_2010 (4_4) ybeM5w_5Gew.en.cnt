noam you are continuing your
prescription your advice that you would
give to President Obama today well the
the economy is a disaster there's ten
percent official unemployment probably
twice that much actual unemployment many
people unemployed for years this is a
huge human tragedy but it's also an
economic tragedy these are unused
resources which could be producing to
make it and and to make the things that
this country needs on the United States
is becoming a kind of a third-world
country you take a the other day I took
a train from Boston to New York that's
the you know the star of the trains of
Amtrak train system I mean it took about
maybe 20 minutes less than the train
that my wife and I took 60 years ago
from Boston to New York in any European
continent industrial country we've taken
a half the time the point of non
industrial countries Spain is not a
super rich countries just introducing a
200 mile an hour a new rail railway and
this is just one example the United
States desperately needs many things of
reconstruction decent infrastructure
decent educational system much more pay
and support for teachers all kinds of
things and the policies that are being
carried out are designed to enrich
primarily financial institutions and
remember that many of the major
corporations like say GE and GM are also
financial institutions its large part of
their activity it's very unclear that
these financial shenanigans do anything
for the economy there's some economists
financier mainstream ones finally
beginning to raise this question they
may harm it in fact but what they do is
in rich rich people and that's where
policies are directed to an alternative
would be to stimulate the economy there
no the demand is very low business the
corporations have money coming out of
their ears the huge profits but they
don't want to spend it don't invest it
I'd rather profit from it financial
institutions don't produce anything they
just shift money around and make money
from various deals the public is the sum
consumer demand but it's very slight we
have to remember that there was an eight
trillion dollar housing bubble that
burst destroying the assets for most
people they're desperately trying to
keep a little to save themselves the
only source of demand right now would be
government spending it doesn't even have
to affect the deficit can be carried out
by borrowing by the Fed which sends
interest right back to the Treasury if
anyone cares about the deficit which is
actually a minor issue I think that
should be the major issue there should
be massive infrastructure spending there
should be spending on things that simple
things like weatherization I mean you
know that we should have a substantial
program to reduce the very severe threat
of global warming that's unfortunately
unlikely within the Republican
legislators and with the with the
effects of the massive corporate
propaganda to try to convince people
that it's a liberal hoax the latest
polls show about maybe a third of
americans think that the belief in
anthropogenic global warming you know
human contribution to global warming and
that's almost a death knell for the
species if the US doesn't do anything
nobody else will you now have chairs
going into the the UN climate change
summit that's taking place in cancun
well the copenhagen summit was a
disaster nothing happened this one
cancun has said it cites much lower in
the hope of at least achieving something
but let's say they achieve all their
goal
which is very unlikely it'll still be a
toothpick on a mountain there are much
more serious problems behind it now
we're now facing a situation where the
house relevant House Committee science
technology energy and so on are being
taken over by climate change deniers in
fact one of them recently said we don't
the worry about it because God will take
care of it well you know this is it's
unbelievable that this is happening in
the richest most powerful country in the
world it's it's a that's one major area
where there should be substantial
changes and improvements if not it's not
going to be anything much more to talk
about in a generation or two others
include just reconstructing the economy
here so that people get back to work
that they can produce things that the
country needs that they can live decent
lives all of that can be done the
resources are there the policies aren't
no you know and when you look at the new
Congress i'm reading from the new yorker
darrell Issa a Republican representative
from California is one of the richest
men in Congress he made his money
selling car alarms which is interesting
because he's twice been accused of auto
theft he said he had a colorful youth
now with the Republicans about to take
control of the house ESA's poised to
become chair of the Oversight Committee
the post comes with wide-ranging
subpoena powers and Issa has already
indicated how he plans to wield them
he's not he assured a group of
pennsylvania republicans over the summer
interested in digging around for the
sort of information that might embarrass
his fellow zillionaires he said i won't
use the temple corporate america live in
fear instead he wants to go where he
sees the real malfeasance he wants to
investigate climate scientists at the
top of his list of the long-suffering
researchers whose emails were hacked
last year from the computer system of
Britain's University of East Anglia
though their work has been subject to
three separate Climategate inquiries all
of which found the allegations of data
manipulation unfounded Issa isn't
satisfied he said recently we're going
to want to have a do-over yeah that's
part of the
massive offensive basically a corporate
offensive and they haven't been quiet
about it like the Chamber of Commerce
biggest business lobby American
Petroleum Institute and others have said
quite publicly that they're carrying out
a massive what they call educational
campaign to convince the population that
global warming isn't real and it's
having a fact that's the you can see it
even in the way the media presented so
you read say New York Times discussion
of climate change they have to be
objective present both sides so one side
is in ninety-eight percent of qualified
scientists and the other side is he said
and then senator Inhofe and a couple of
climate change skeptics there notice
also missing as a third side namely a
very substantial number of leading
scientists who say that the consensus is
nowhere near alarmist enough that in
fact the situation is much worse well
you know the United States is now it has
been dragging its feet on this for a
long time that's not much worse I mean
that was just recently couple days ago
there was a report by an analysis of
green technology production turns out
China is in the lead Germany is next
Spain is high up there the United States
is one of the lowest in fact invest
investment from the United States in
green technology is higher in China I
think twice as high in China than in the
United States and then it is in the
United States and Europe combined now
these are real social pathologies
exacerbated by the latest election but
just one aspect of where policy is going
totally in the wrong direction whether
our significant alternatives and if
they're not pursued there's maclee could
be real disaster I'd like to switch
gears for a minute and Noam Chomsky and
talk about the elections and
that just took place yeah elections you
should put in quotation marks if we had
elections in the United States in which
the Democratic and Republican parties
were barred and their political leaders
were exiled to South Africa and not
allowed to return to the united states
that we wouldn't consider them serious
elections but that's exactly what
happened in Haiti the major political
party is barred as long as we know the
United States and France essentially
invaded Haiti in 2004 kidnapped the
president sent him off to Central Africa
his party is now banned most analysts
assumed that as in the past if it was
allowed to run it would probably win the
election president our firm president
aristede is by all information available
the most popular political figure in
Haiti not only is he not allowed to run
by essentially the US but not allowed to
return they have been trying to keep him
out of the hemisphere can't go back to
Haiti but the US have been trying to
keep them out of the hemisphere all
together what's taken place is a kind of
a charade I mean it's not nothing you
know patients are trying to express
themselves we should respect that but
the major choices that they might have
are barred by foreign power us power and
France which is the second of the two
historic torturers of haiti honduras
actually interestingly in these cables
that have come out through the wikileaks
release is a US diplomatic cable from
2008 that says exactly what the US
government would not say publicly that
the coup against manuel zelaya was
outright illegal your response Noam
Chomsky that's right this is an analysis
by the embassy in Honduras disculpa
saying that they've done a careful
analysis of the legal and constitutional
backgrounds and conclude you can read
their summary which is conclusion that
there is no doubt that the coup was
illegal and unconstitutional the
government of Washington as you point
out wouldn't say that and in fact after
some dithering Obama finally have
essentially recognized that the
legitimacy the coup he supported the
election taking place under the coup
regime which most other kind of most of
Latin America and Europe refused to
recognize at all but the US did it in
fact the US ambassador publicly accused
Latin Americans who would go along as
being seduced by magic realism you know
Garcia Marquez novels or something just
a statement of contempt they should go
along with us and support the military
coup which is illegal and
unconstitutional and has many effects
one effect was that it preserves for the
United States a major air base the
Palmer Ola air base one of the last ones
remaining in Latin America and kicked
out of all the others no we I have two
questions we only have two minutes left
one is about North Korea the WikiLeaks
documents show Chinese diplomats saying
that Chinese officials increasingly
doubt the usefulness of neighboring
North Korea and would support
reunification the significance of this
I'm very skeptical about that statement
there's no indication that China China
would be willing to have US troops on
its border and that's for the very
likely outcome of a reunified Korea
they've been bitterly objecting to US
naval maneuvers in the yellow seed not
far from their code what they call their
economic territorial waters and
expanding US military forces near their
borders is the last thing they want they
may feel I don't know that North Korea
simply is unviable and it'll have to
collapse and that's
terrible problem for them from a points
of view that I don't know but I'm pretty
skeptical about that leak finally gnome
your latest book hopes and prospects
what gives you hope well the hopes part
of that book is mostly about South
America where there really have been
significant dramatic changes in the past
decade for the first time in 500 years
the South American countries have been
moving towards integration which is a
prerequisite for independence and have
become begun to face some of their
really desperate internal problems huge
disparity between islands of extreme
wealth and massive poverty number of the
countries including the leading one
Brazil have seconds chipped away at that
yeah Bolivia has been quite dramatic
with the takeover by the indigenous
population in a major democratic
election these are important facts noam
chomsky thanks so much
