hello I'm Richard gisbert and you're
watching a special edition of The
Listening Post it's been 30 years now
since the publication of one of the most
influential books ever written about the
institution that we cover the media
manufacturing consent the political
economy of the mass media was
co-authored by Noam Chomsky and Edward
Herrmann the book provided searing
critiques of journalism and the news
media's relationship to power it spelled
out how media corporations and the
journalists who work for them often end
up defending the economic social and
political agendas of governments and
corporations it walked us through how
the media represents certain privileged
groups in society while effectively
suppressing the voices of others most of
us working on this program have been
influenced in one way or another by
manufacturing consent and so to mark the
anniversary of its publication we went
to Tucson Arizona to talk to know him
Chomsky it's a two-part interview we
began by showing professor Chomsky the
following animation one that we made
last year that boiled down some of the
basic arguments that he and Herrmann
made in manufacturing consent in 1988
Noam Chomsky co-authored a book with
Edward Herrmann called manufacturing
consent
it blasted apart the notion that media
acts as a check on political powers
Media operate through five filters the
first has to do with ownership mass
media firms are big corporations often
they're part of even bigger
conglomerates their endgame profit and
so it's in their interests to push for
whatever guarantees that profit critical
journalism takes second place to the
needs and interests of the corporation
[Music]
the second filter exposes the real role
of advertising media costs a lot more
than consumers will ever pay so who
fills the gap advertisers and what are
the advertisers paying for audiences and
so it isn't so much that the media are
selling you a product their output
they're also selling advertisers of
product you
how does the establishment manage the
media that's the third filter journalism
cannot be a check on power because the
very system encourages complicity
governments corporations big
institutions know how to play the media
game they know how to influence the news
narrative they feed media scoops
official accounts interviews with the
experts they make themselves crucial to
the process of journalism so those in
power and those who report on them are
in bed with each other
if you want to challenge power you'll be
pushed to the margins your name won't be
down you won't be getting in you lost
your access you've lost the story
when the media journalists
whistleblowers sources stray away from
the consensus they get flat that's the
fourth filter when the story is
inconvenient for the powers that be
you'll see the flat machine in action
discrediting sources trashing stories
and diverting the conversation
to manufacture consent you need an enemy
a target that common enemy is the fifth
filter communism terrorists immigrants
enemy a boogeyman to fear helps Corral
public opinion
five filters one big media theory
consent is being manufactured all around
you all the time so professor Chomsky
does that video capture the ideas that
you wanted in that book I think it's
brilliantly done I think its success
will be measured by whether it
encourages people to ask what does it
mean when you have concentrated private
power producing a product namely
audiences for a market which consists of
concentrated private power with tight
links to state power what do you expect
the media output to look like and with
that framework of a structural framework
behind if it encourages people to ask
that question I think it'll be very
successful the title manufacturing
consent it does get to the crux of how
you see the role of the media in Western
democracies we get the feeling that you
were out to destroy a few myths well
interestingly the term the phrase
manufacturing consent was not ours we
borrowed it from the leading public
intellectual of the 20th century walter
Lippmann he said that's a new art and
democracy to manufacture consent so that
the ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders
his phrase the population will be
passive and a quiescent and will accept
the rule of the responsible men people
like us and in fact the myth is that the
media are independent adversarial
courageous struggling against power and
it's actually true of some very fine
often very fine reporters correspondents
in fact the media doesn't honest
courageous job but within a framework
that determines what to discuss what not
to discuss and what we try to
demonstrate in the book is that if you
simply look at the institutional
structure of the media within a state
capitalist society like ours they're
performing a pretty much the way you'd
expect we'll get back to the rest of
that interview in just a few minutes
over the years manufacturing consent has
sold millions of copies it's had a
profound influence on many accomplished
journalists and not just in the u.s. we
spoke to three of them the
editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post's
Indian Edition Aman Satie
the Israeli journalist Amira Hass and
Matt Taibbi an American best known for
his work with Rolling Stone magazine we
asked them about the book what they took
from it and the importance of critical
analysis of the global news media today
[Music]
Manufacturing consent had a big
influence on me as a young reporter I
had always thought that we lived in a
completely free society where the
reporting was outstanding the Free Press
model worked exactly the way it should
and when I read that book I realized
that there were significant problems the
book and the notion and the analysis
first of all unveiled America of the
myths of being such a splendid democracy
so it was part of Chomsky's and others
and attempts to show that there are so
many deficiencies in this democracy that
are being ignored by many analysts
he is saying that there is a
superstructure of power that basically
uses the media as propaganda that is his
his broad formulation and I would push
back against that and say that it's not
easy to manufacture that kind of consent
today because when people receive news
it's not like people actually believe
everything they see on the news right so
I think one of the legacies of
manufacturing consent has been that it
kind of provided a neat formulation to
sum up the unease that people felt with
a monolithic production of information
[Music]
this is a very humanist and optimistic
statement the believes that people with
information can bring to a change and
this is how I started really when I
started working in Gaza in the early 90s
where did the Israeli public knows
nothing about the occupation and what it
means I was waiting for for my
information to reach others and to
change the awareness and I realized
quite soon that this was not the case
well I think we've seen many graphic
examples of how we can manufacture
consent through the media I think the
ultimate example has to be the invasion
of Iraq in 2003 if you had told
Americans after 9/11 that we were going
to invade a country that had no
connection to the 9/11 hijackers and
that we were going to do it under the
pretense of combating international
terrorism most people would have thought
you were crazy but we were able to sell
that idea relatively easily to the
entire American population this is Fox
News and Fox News Channel continuing
coverage of the campaign which now has
begun to liberate and disarm Iraq but
all they really needed was a few key
voices among the highest opinion makers
in the country and on TV the read we get
on the people of Iraq is there's no
question but what they want to get rid
of Saddam Hussein and they will welcome
as liberators the United States when we
come to do that and we were able to sell
that war pretty easily
I think sourcing is actually perhaps one
of the most interesting filters that he
talks about
I think sourcing is something that all
journalists have to think a lot about we
should think very hard about with which
or what are the sources that we give
credence and balance to which are the
sources that we give importance to and
which are the sources we don't give
importance to so who decides about the
hierarchy what is important what is not
important
very often I realize that if you have
information that is official this is
called investigative journalism but if
you actually talk about the main at the
same thing from the mouths of the people
themselves let's say about dangers of a
water contamination in Gaza if it's the
people themselves this is not seen as a
serious or as serious information as
when it comes from an official
I come from a family of journalists my
father was a reporter dating back to the
60s when he started in the business
reporters tended to come from more
humble origins a lot of people didn't go
to college they entered the business as
paper kids or as printers when they were
16 or so but in the 70s after all the
president's men journalism became sexy
it became a thing for upper-class Ivy
League kids to do and by the time I was
in the business and I'm you know I'm
partly representative of this problem
because I came from that class myself we
all live in cities we represent a
certain point of view we hang out with
politicians and their aides we are part
of the ruling class and our failure to
recognize that it's not you know it's
not necessarily through any fault of our
own but but we're very separate and
distinct from the the ordinary person
Chomsky's model produces a sense of
inevitability which is job even if I see
that I have the freedom to write about
whatever I want to write about
so I'm ski would say yeah that's because
there's already a filter in front of you
and you don't even know what you
contract about how can you how can you
that I'm self censoring I'm sure you
believe everything but what I'm saying
is if you believe something different
it's easy to see that people believe
what they believe because their consent
has been manufactured but what if people
know exactly what's going on and still
believe what they believe fled and
that's terrifying and I think that's
what even maybe Chomsky can bring
himself to look at the fact that if
people say I don't care about the facts
I still believe that this should happen
and would you say about the whole
formulation of manufacturing concept the
book and the concept are relevant
because they offer
to every journalist kind of lighthouse
it invokes people's skepticism and this
is always important though as I said
before I think that the problems are the
today we have so much access to
information in other ways that we are in
a collision with the fact that people
are not interested in what does not
serve immediately their interest and
this is a very sad realization so I
think the legacy of Chomsky's book in
that sense is that it provides us with a
manual of commonly made mistakes and so
I think it's something that then makes
us think about what we're doing and
makes us more mindful of our journalism
[Music]
when you wrote this book in 1988 roughly
fifty corporations controlled every
single mass media outlet in the United
States now there are just six Time
Warner Viacom News Corp Disney among
them what effect is that had do you
think on democracy in America all of
that cheapens and reduces the access to
information and understanding now there
is a way to compensate for that the
internet does allow us to reach to
people organize form collectives
interact with one another it's possible
to use the enormous resources that are
available to overcome the impact of the
concentration of media and in fact can
be done pretty effectively
earlier this year American television
viewers were treated to the spectacle on
the Sinclair Broadcasting System which
is not that well-known a company but
which owns hundreds of local affiliates
in the United States the sharing of
biased and false news has come all too
common on they put out an editorial an
editorial where the same words were read
by hundreds of different news anchors
small cities in from Kansas to the
Florida Panhandle what did you make of
all those news anchors in all those
markets mouthing those same words and
reading those same scripts remember
compelled to do so they didn't have a
choice
you wanted to stay and keep your job you
read what Big Brother told you to read
this is a mode of propaganda that we
associate with totalitarian states the
fact that it's done by a private tyranny
which is what a corporation is it
doesn't change the character of it and
it's kind of interesting that in real in
actual totalitarian states say the old
Soviet Union people studies showed that
people tended to distrust the media
because it was so obvious that was
coming from the state authorities I was
founded interesting that after the wall
came down all these Western journalists
were send in by various Western
foundations to train journalists from
Eastern Europe Warsaw Pact countries but
what I knew of those places was that
their news consumers were far more
discerning about what information they
were taking in and I thought rather than
sending Western journalists to
quote-unquote train in Russian or polish
journalists we should send news
consumers from those countries to come
West to train us what do you think that
idea well the studies of the old Soviet
Union which were intensive showed that a
large part of the population recognized
that what they're getting is controlled
authoritarian centered propaganda of the
Western system propaganda is nowhere
near that crude it looks independent
there is a certain amount of variety
that when Sinclair sends out a demand
that everyone read the same editorial
that's unusual it's not the kind of
thing that's done in the Western system
and the eastern sister
it was done and that does lead to a
healthy skepticism that's exactly what
you noticed we don't have to go back far
to the days the halcyon days of social
media the Arab Spring 2011 so much
optimism in the air and the belief that
the rise of these alternative voices on
these platforms would have a
democratizing effect on governance turns
out that that was misguided what
happened well first of all there is a
positive aspect to the social media
almost all activist movements rely on
them to bring people together and so on
so what happened in the first months the
Arab Spring was very exciting
you may recall that at one point the
dictator Mubarak closed the Internet to
try to prevent the social media from
functioning what happened is that
activism increased because instead of
sending messages out electronically
people actually talk to each other now
that's the base the the central way to
organize and and create a kind of
culture of what I call collective
self-defense
you couldn't have foreseen the emergence
of the tech giants who are such a big
part of the global news media today and
their rise has made them unwieldy
purveyors of power they've grown rich at
the expense of many media outlets has
anyone come up with useful ways of how
and what to do with them how to deal
with them and what to do with it well
not really remember that these are not
the sources of news like Facebook
doesn't have bureaus around the world
what these have created is a array of
social media which are double-edged
sometimes they're used for constructive
purposes but they have also become major
forces for undermining democracy we see
that
everywhere right now in Brazil for
example with scandals erupting directly
about the fact that billions of dollars
were spent to produce defamatory
information on the social media against
the PT the Workers Party to support the
literally neo-fascist candidate who won
the campaign it's only one example these
things are now happening over and over
and it's a very dangerous phenomena
you've written a great deal about Latin
America and a few years back leaders
such as Chavez in Venezuela Morales in
Bolivia the Kirchner's in Argentina
Correa in Ecuador they were all pushing
for some form of media reform to spread
ownership out to limit the power of
conglomerates in Latin America their
critics then accused them of basically
trying to usurp the powers from the
political right and drag them off to the
left
did the critics of those leaders who
were trying to reform media in Latin
America actually have a point in fact
the problem of in all of the countries
you mentioned is they didn't do anywhere
near enough to try to set up alternative
independent public publicly controlled
media that would counter the high
concentration of ultra-right media in
Latin America which has been a scandal
for years manufacturing consent is a
considered a seminal work it's not an
easy read for people it's and it's a
difficult area to explore and dissect on
television in particular because of its
limitations and the limited attention
spans of some of the people who are
watching this program in conveying some
of these ideas have you ever thought of
taking some of those media training
courses that those corporate executives
take the train them to speak in sound
bytes probably not huh I remember once
that there was a program called a
Nightline television ABC
they got a lot of criticism because I
was never on the director said I'm not
the kind of person they could have on
because I don't understand concision
namely saying two sentences between ads
that's a terrific form of propaganda so
for example if you're asked is a Arana
terrorist state you can say yes they do
this not the other thing if you if
you're asked is the United States a
terrorist State which of course way
beyond Iran you can't say it in two
minutes because first you have to break
down the prejudices and assumptions and
dogmas about the United States being a
force for freedom and democracy you
can't do that into between two ads so
the very idea of concision is a fine
technique for imposing that propaganda
of the power of those who are powerful
they can say anything they want against
enemies in two minutes but they can't be
exposed in two minutes
final question for you when you get up
in the morning where do you go to get
your news the first thing I look at is
the New York Times Stella it's still
with all of its flaws and they're real
it still has the broadest the most
comprehensive coverage of I think any
newspaper in the world and then where do
you go from there
then many other places Washington Post
the business press foreign press
aljazeera Democracy Now many other
sources Noam Chomsky thank you so much
for joining us the listening post thank
you one of the last points that Chomsky
made about starting his news day with
the New York Times we included that
because we found his response telling
know'm Chomsky is among the timeses
sharpest critics but he doesn't simply
dismiss the newspaper he doesn't as so
many people suspicious of the mainstream
media have cut the cord and live in a
world void of conventional news outlets
he goes there but he considers the
source he does the diligence shops
around gets other views sometimes from
outside the American News bubble he
co-wrote the book 30 years ago but
there's a lesson in there for news
consumers trying to make sense of the
media today you've been watching a
special edition of our program we'll see
you next time here at The Listening Post
