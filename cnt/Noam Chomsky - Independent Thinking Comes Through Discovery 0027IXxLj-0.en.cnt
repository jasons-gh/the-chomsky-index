right here at MIT leading Science and
Technology University in the world these
senior faculty teach elementary courses
as they should now one of the great
physicists of the 20th century Victor
Weisskopf was famous for what he used to
tell his introductory classes I mean if
they would ask that what are we gonna
cover this semester Hugh his answer was
it doesn't matter what we cover it
matters what you discover if you can
discover things you're on your way to
being an independent thinker and that's
what education should be I'm at the
graduate level which is mostly where I
am you don't teach and expect people to
students to answer things and tests an
interactive process of participation and
cooperation to try to discover and learn
what it means to discover and that can
be done from kindergarten to MIT
graduate courses
