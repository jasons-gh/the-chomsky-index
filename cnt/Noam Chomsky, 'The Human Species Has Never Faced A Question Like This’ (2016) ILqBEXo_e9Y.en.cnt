with support from the climate kick
Alumni Association
welcome to the elephant I'm campaigners
human species has been around for about
200,000 years and we've now reached the
point where we have to make a decision
as to whether the species is going to
survive in anything like its current
form of organization weather has never
been a decision like that posed to
humans before while risking the very
future of our species is how my guests
today Noam Chomsky printed when it comes
to the threat of climate change and he
pins the blame for the fact that we're
racing over the precipice was seemingly
little concerned squarely on the rich
and the powerful and the peculiar
institutional systems we've set up of
politics and economics with short-term
profits somehow Trump considerations for
the future livability of our planet the
institutional requirement of short-term
profit making evidently overwhelms
concern for whether here grandchildren
are gonna have a chance for a decent
position
I don't know exactly what word to use
for that I'm not sure rationality is
quite strong some Chomsky is perhaps the
world's best-known distant and public
intellectual and at 87 years old and
after three-quarters of a century
speaking out against all forms of
inequality state repression and violence
it hasn't lost any of us outspokenness
all we can talk of the others building
pipelines it's a sign of a social and
political system that is so sick that it
cannot face obvious issues and deal with
them sensibly a few months ago on this
program I played another conversation I
have with Noam Chomsky one that I had
recorded for a previous radio project
and in that conversation we spoke about
what activism could do in the fight
against climate change but given that
he's been one of the world's most
important thinkers and political voices
and how brilliantly he explains the
institutional framework that lays behind
understanding our current system and the
woes it produces when I had the
opportunity to talk to him again
specifically for the elephant I left at
the chance no okay thank you so here's
my conversation recorded last week with
Noam Chomsky hi I know him at his office
at MIT by Skype well Noam Chomsky thanks
so much for joining me you've recently
said in a few different places that were
at an astonishing moment in human
history I was wondering if you could
just explain briefly why you think
that's the case why it is an astonishing
moment in human history yeah
what well human species has been around
for about 200,000 years and up until
this point people have made decisions
about their lives their immediate
futures and so on but we've now reached
a point where we have to make a decision
as to whether the species is going to
survive in anything like its current
form of organization and social systems
and there are basically two the two
fundamental questions one is the
question of nuclear war which we know by
now we know by now that if there were a
nuclear war between two major powers
they would both be destroyed and so
would everything else and we've been on
the verge of that repeatedly for seventy
years and the threat is increasing again
so that's one decision the other
decision has to be made right now even
though the consequences will be several
decades
even a few generations away and that has
to do with climate change if we do not
make decisive steps right now then we
can be fairly confident that within a
pretty short time maybe decades maybe
more there will be irreversible and
catastrophic consequences there has
never been a decision like that posed to
humans before incidentally we have
already made the decision
inadvertently for a huge number of
species other than humans so the
destruction of species today as a result
were substantially of anthropogenic
climate warming is about on the order of
12 the fifth extinction 65 million years
ago when an asteroid huge asteroid hit
the earth that's presumed to be the
reason for the relatively sudden
extinction of dinosaurs end of the age
of dinosaurs opening of the way for
small mammals which ultimately evolved
into us and now we are playing the role
of the asteroid so we've already decided
that for millions of huge numbers of
species we've decided they're going to
become extinct and we now have to make a
similar decision about ourselves won't
the extinction but it might be
catastrophic consequences you know one
thing that always occurs to me when I
hear you talk about the environmental
crisis is how irrational it all is or
how irrational our collective behavior
is you point out that it's the rich and
powerful and the existing power systems
that are pushing us towards this
precipice but even they will suffer the
consequences if there's a climate
disruption their grandchildren suffer
you know they own land and in Manhattan
and Miami the rich own estates in you
know Long Island so what do you think
accounts for this seemingly
completely irrational behavior it's a
pretty striking phenomena so take a look
at the presidential primaries that are
underway in the United States as I
mentioned there are these two huge
problems the first one nuclear war is
barely mentioned in either primary few
comments on it on the Republican side
there's just a commitment to greater
militarization for the Democrats also
the same but not quite to that extent
but the issue and the the rising crisis
and the the almost miraculous escape for
the last 70 years just isn't mentioned
take climate change on the Republican
side it's mentioned it's denied every
Republican candidate with the single
exception
Kasich simply denies that it's happening
Kasich is worse he's supposed to be the
reasonable one he says sure it's
happening but let's not do anything
about it and I think that's even worse
than denying it so that's a hundred
percent on the Republican side saying
let's race to the precipice as quickly
as possible
and this is not academic it's already
had an impact significant impact so a
couple of days ago there was a signing
of the United Nations of the agreement
reached in Paris last December
international agreement to restrict
carbon dioxide emissions but notice that
the agreement was not a treaty the
intention was to have a verifiable
treaty agreement that countries would
commit themselves to live up to with
penalties if they don't couldn't be done
and there was one simple reason the
Republican Congress it would simply not
accept a treaty so as a result the Paris
agreement had to be a voluntary
agreement which means it's much weaker
and if they expose Donald Trump or any
other Republican work to win the
election
assuming they mean what they say they
would be essentially telling the world
don't do anything
doesn't matter builders or any coal
plants as you like oh because it's not
happening anyway I mean if you wanna
talk about irrationality it's free art
goes beyond this I mean there are more
focused cases that we can look at so for
example it's now known that the
scientists at Exxon Mobil that decades
ago made it very clear to management
that use of fossil fuels is it might
have lethal catastrophic effects and
they simply concealed it in fact lied
about the organized major propaganda
campaigns to convince people that it's
not happening and as you say they have
grandchildren but the institutional
requirement of short-term profit-making
evidently overwhelms concern or whether
your grandchildren are going to have a
chance for a decent existence I don't
know exactly what word to use for that
I'm not sure rationality is quite strong
enough it's really criminal in morality
at the same time it always strikes me
that you more than the most dissidents
appeal to to rationality you know you
don't you don't you're not want to
appeal to emotion very often you you
really appeal to listeners and readers
reason and so I do believe that as a
species we are capable of of rationality
even though it seems that we so often
don't follow that we are capable of it
that you know that it's not always a
driving force in our existence and
actually there are major efforts
huge efforts made to undermine
rationality and they're all there right
in front of us all the time so every
time you turn on a television set you're
being bombarded with massive efforts to
turn you into an utterly irrational
creature that's what the advertising
industry is about if you took a course
in economics you'd learned that markets
are based on informed consumers making
rational choices
what's the advertising industry it's an
effort to create uninformed consumers
making irrational choices so if if
market systems really prevailed say
General Motors that would have a short
advertisement in which would say here
are the characteristics of the cars we
are selling next year and here's what
they say about it in consumer report
they don't do that that what they do is
try to produce some huge amount of
effort and money goes into creating
illusions about you know the famous
sports heroes is it driving a car and it
sells off in the stratosphere or
something like that the idea is to
create illusions which will turn normal
people into uninformed consumers who
will be making highly irrational choices
and hundreds of billions of dollars a
year spent on this as a major part of
the economy is an effort to do this and
the the media system and as some of that
character as well a lot of the deceit
and distortion our efforts conscious or
not that to prevent people from being
informed and in a position to make
rational choices so for example almost
anything you paid about a week ago a
Greenpeace released a couple of hundred
pages that is
somehow from the transatlantic investor
and trade agreement this being
negotiated in secret like also trade
agreements why is it negotiated in
secret to keep people from knowing about
it um there are three days but the real
reason is simply to keep the public from
knowing about it and as soon as
something leaks you see why it's
described in the press all the time as a
free trade agreement it's not a free
trade agreement highly protectionist a
lot of it has nothing to do with trade
as to with investor rights the rights of
corporations to sue governments if they
undertake regulatory actions that might
interfere with the future profits none
of this is aimed with trade
as I stood with investor rights very
much like all the agreements that we
already seen after trade organizations
on but the immediate consistently that's
close to 100 percent
refer to these things as free trade
agreements that's conscious or not maybe
it's just unconscious to see you just
unconsciously go along with the dictates
of power or maybe it's conscious to see
but it's an effort to prevent the
citizenry from being informed and in
position to make rational decisions and
that happens over note so another
example almost at random off in the
United States it's in fact much of the
West it's a kind of routine to describe
Iran as the gravest threat to world
peace get to put missiles and Romania to
protect that Europe from Iranians and so
on we have to have the extensive
controls to make sure that Iran doesn't
do something that doesn't violate an
agreement can we impose on it because
Iran is such a terrible danger to world
he'd be worse than
though there's a world there the world
has opinions and the opinions are not
the major polling agencies u.s. polling
agencies take polls of international
opinion and one of the questions they
ask is which countries the greatest
threat to world peace the Iran is barely
mentioned the country that is mentioned
is the United States by a margin that's
regarded as the greatest threat to world
peace there's no other country that's
even close do Americans know about this
mom course the media simply didn't
publish it
that's citizens uninformed about crucial
matters I want to go back to to climate
change because this is a program
specifically on on climate change
and I was wondering within the within
the climate change topic there's a huge
range of figures who are working on it
there's everyone from Al Gore to to
people who are saying we need an
entirely new system and are trying to
create new ways of living in order to
solve climate change and so I was
wondering what your thoughts are on if
climate change can be solved within the
current political and economic system it
can we meet this challenge within the
the system that we have or do we do we
need in a sense a new system it is
possible to deal with climate change
within the current state capitalist
systems by carrying out measures which
are pretty well understood so one
measure that could be instituted
immediately is a carbon tax the carbon
tax would at least internalize the costs
that are imposed by use of carbon it
would it would impose a great burden on
those who use fossil fuels and even
mainstream economists say this is
easiest way to do it that's not going to
end the crisis but it would be a major
step forward that is there a carbon tax
not in the United States
even though according to polls almost
half the population is thinks it's a
good idea that's without practically
anybody advocating it if it was real
advocacy in fact almost all the
commentaries against nevertheless almost
half the population is in favor of it
and that could be a significant step it
is certainly within the framework of
existing institutions this morning if
you look at the front page of the New
York Times discusses a conflict that's
arising in the Democratic Party between
two of its major constituencies
environmental and labor the labor
constituency that wants support for the
building gas lines like Keystone XL the
environmental sector the parties against
it so this is split and you can
understand the problem it's one of the
reasons why the white working-class is
drifting to the Republicans to their
major class enemy literally to the party
that wants to really smash them in the
face but they're doing it because partly
because the environmentalists and the
Democratic Party are opposed to things
like the XL pipeline is their solution
to this transparently but it's not
discussed the this country needs massive
construction work on things like
decaying infrastructure or a high-speed
rail all sorts of things that require an
enormous amount of labor the capital is
their workers want to work that can be
done something even raised all we can
talk about is building pipelines going
back to it I don't know if the right
word is a rationality again but it's a
sign of a social and political system
that is so sick
that it cannot face obvious issues and
deal with them since
so you have to tear the party apart over
whether we're gonna have pipelines when
there's plenty of demand for labor and
technical work construction work all
kinds I mean even things like
weatherization of homes that quit which
is environmentally sound and could also
be very helpful to the economy and
provide jobs a couple years ago the
government essentially nationalized the
auto industry during the crisis
financial crisis and took over
practically the whole auto industry
there were choices at that point but
they were not discussed one choice would
be should we hand the auto industry
after that taxpayer bails it out should
we hand it back to the old owners or
clones maybe different faces but the
same basically the same people and have
it continue to produce automobiles
that's one possibility
another possibility was should we have
the industry the direct did not do you
see more automobiles but the producing
of an efficient mass transportation
system after all this to see about the
only country that doesn't have anything
like I speed rail a very inefficient
mass transportation which is very costly
to the economy and very costly to
individuals and should the industry be
handed over to the old owners or should
it be handed over to the workforce and
the communities as a democratic society
to do these questions
literally were not raised except way out
at the margins like I talked about
couple other people talked about it but
it's simply not part of the discussion
but it should be a critical part I mean
it's kind of astonishing that you can go
from China to Central Asia in high-speed
rail but you can't go from Boston to New
York and in fact the train from Boston
to New York today which is the pride of
Amtrak is maybe
fifteen minutes faster than when I took
it 60 70 years 65 years ago it's a shot
if it even makes it on time which I've
done doesn't do these are um these are
even burdens on the rich and dry is
mostly business people but instead of
getting to New York from Boston and you
know an hour and a half they sit around
for your own you said elsewhere that in
order to deal with the environmental
crisis we're going to have to dismantle
an entire sociological cultural economic
and ideological structure which is
driving us to disaster and it can so
often be hard to imagine when when we're
embedded within a system of what an
alternative could look like and I was
wondering I know you don't have any
specific thoughts on you know what a
society might look like but do you have
any general broad thoughts on the values
or the overall structure that a society
that was actually sustainable might look
like yeah should be democratic that's an
alternative to err society an
alternative to err societies democracy
that we live in the cottage cheese not
democracy a democracy would mean that
every functioning institution production
Commerce information all of them would
simply be under popular Democratic
control so industrial installations
would be run by their workforce in
interaction with democratic communities
is this a radical idea kind of but it's
also a mainstream idea so if you take a
look at the major US social philosopher
John Dewey straight out of mainstream
America I'm practically paraphrasing it
in fact he points out that unless this
is done politics will be as he puts it
just the shadow cast on society by big
business which is pre accurate that's
mainstream America in fact those ideas
are not very
below the surface and ordinary people's
consciousness it's just out of the
conversation it cannot imagine democracy
impermissible but that is an alternative
to our existing system it's called
usually called libertarian socialism but
it's basically a democracy and along
with that do you also think that we need
solidarity in order to solve the crisis
solidarity well that's an interesting
question and it's from a cultural and
ideological point of view it's very
interesting just look at the history so
if you go back to the Enlightenment and
the origins of classical liberalism and
say people like Adam Smith or David Hume
and others they simply took it for
granted that solidarity a sympathy a
mutual aid work or elements of human
nature
they were the driving forces in human
nature in fact take Adam Smith's famous
phrase invisible and the way it's
interpreted is almost diametrically
opposite to the way he used it in fact
he barely used it but in one of them
only twice actually and in one case
which is directly related to this here's
what he argues he says he was thinking
of an agricultural economy of course so
he said suppose some land owner
accumulates almost all the land so
everybody else has to essentially be his
servant he says well this really won't
matter very much because the land owner
by virtue of his sympathy for other
people and concern for their needs will
make sure that property is distributed
so that it will be relatively equal so
as if by an invisible hand we'll end up
with a fair and relatively egalitarian
society not a very powerful argument but
it shows the
the kind of driving concept that
underlies classical liberalism
enlightenment ideals and so on now all
of that ended with capitalism Adam Smith
and David Hume and others are basically
pre-capitalist capitalist ideology is
different it's get which can for
yourself and kick everyone else in the
face and now it's claimed that that's
human nature is it I don't think so
I think Adam Smith David Hume and others
were basically correct this is a
distorting ideology which is imposed on
us and undermines normal human emotions
and interactions highly dystopian
deceitful and going back to the
environmental crisis that that's what's
causing us to race over the precipice
and when ExxonMobil executives say okay
let's lie about the fossil fuels they're
saying they're actually what they're
doing is pursuing what Adam Smith
denounced as in his words the vile Maxon
of the Masters of mankind all for
ourselves and nothing for anyone else
and sometimes this is even explicit like
one economist famous economist Nobel
laureate kind of an icon of the
right-wing libertarians James Buchanan
that once said that the ideal situation
for any person is to be the owner of
everything and have everyone else be his
slave can you imagine any non
pathological human being who could even
dream of that idea but from the point of
view of right-wing libertarian economics
you know that's the ideal situation
that's what we really like it's a grand
basic yeah I want to ask you one last
question which is you know the climate
change crisis can seem so overwhelming
it's easy to to feel
despair there's so much change that
needs to happen really quickly if we're
going to avoid really dire consequences
but there's also something that is also
obvious from following the news over the
past five years let alone history is
that things are very unpredictable it
can be hard to predict what will happen
and I was wondering if you think this is
where we should get some hope is that
the what will happen is is quite
unpredictable that we can't tell what
will happen well I think there's plenty
of grounds for hope just take what I
mentioned before that even with with
almost no public support and plenty of
articulate opposition correctly half the
American population are still in favor
of the carbon tax in fact just about
maybe every county in the United States
if you look at attitudes so polls
indicate people are in favor of more
regulation of the emissions this is all
latent attitudes and the hope is that
they can be turned into a powerful
organized popular force which very
quickly will compel the leadership or
also replace the leadership or even
replace the institutions and and
Institute the policies that have to be
carried out right now means essentially
ending the use of fossil fuels and
pretty quickly can be done there are
alternatives well they can be developed
more and it's it's the way to save the
to put a brake on this race to disaster
and offer decent possibilities for a
future survival I don't you optimistic
we can do that that we can meet this
challenge as a species an optimistic
well I think we should simply continue
to keep in mind the slogan that I'm
trying to do crunchy made famous that we
can have the pessimism of the intellect
but we should have optimism of the will
and the pointed grounds for it and we
should grasp the hopes and opportunities
that do exist and make sure that they
become implemented and operated well
Noam Chomsky thanks so much for joining
me today
yeah
that was my conversation with professor
and political thinker Noam Chomsky and
that's it for the elephant this time the
elephant is made with support from the
climate kick
that's kic Alumni Association it's a
community of entrepreneurs and young
professionals working on creating a
climate resilient society you can find
out more at cka aeo our website is
elephant podcasts org where we have all
of our past episodes and to keep up to
date you can like our page on Facebook
or follow us on Twitter and before we
sign off one last word from Noam Chomsky
and actually could I just get you to
give one last comment we know the
Republican stance on climate change
could you comment on how you view
Hillary Clinton's stance on climate
change Hillary Clinton well she hasn't
talked about it much but I suspect her
position would be pretty much like
Obama's which is some steps infinitely
better than the Republican stance some
steps but not sufficient ones and what
would then be required is substantial
powerful public pressure to turn these
some steps into major steps I'm come
canards see you next time
you
