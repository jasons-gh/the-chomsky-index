well you know Democrats and Republicans
aren't a category the Republicans and
Democrats differ like on the rare
occasions when I vote and are pretty
rare sometimes I vote for Democrats
sometimes for Republicans sometimes for
somebody else it's it's not a sharp
split there two factions of the same
party we have a one-party state with two
somewhat different factions with a lot
of overlap business party has a couple
of factions violent that you find some
differences between I wouldn't say
there's no difference on the average so
what should you do in that case well
like everything is your own choice do
you want to live in a Democratic Society
or do you want to live in the society we
have which remember is not a Democratic
Society and is not intended to be if you
take a course in political theory here
I'm sure they'll teach you that the
United States is not a democracy it's
what's called in the technical
literature of polyarchy that's the term
invented by the leading Democratic
theorist you know professor Robert Dahl
but the idea is old very does way back
to James Madison and the foundation of
the Constitution of polyarchy is a
system in which power resides in the
hands of those who Madison called the
wealth of the nation the responsible
class of men and the rest of the
population is fragmented distracted
allowed to participate every couple of
years they're allowed to come and say
yes thank you why don't you continue for
another four years and they have a
little choice among the responsible men
the wealth of the nation but that's the
way the country was founded it was
founded on the principle explained by
Madison and the Constitutional
Convention that the primary goal of
government is to protect the minority of
the opulent against the majority that's
and then the Constitution was designed
to sort of ensure that there's been a
lot of struggle about it over the years
you know a lot of victories have been
won by the public so it's not the same
as it was two centuries ago but that
remains that remains the elite ideal and
it's a constant struggle and most of the
population is well O'Hara so for example
take the November 2000 election there
was a lot of among intellectuals
educated people you know university
professors and people like that there
was a great deal of outrage about the
stolen election an article after article
about the Supreme Court and Anakin's and
you know Florida this and that and so on
if you read through that literature
which was vast you know there's a
constant refrain nobody can understand
why the public didn't care the public is
a game among intellectuals public just
didn't care so okay the election was
stolen who cares it was never an issue
among the public why wasn't it an issue
well you know if you look at this is
very heavily attitudes in the United
States are very carefully monitored
business wants to know what people are
thinking and in fact there there is for
example at Harvard at the Kennedy School
of Government a project called the
vanishing voter graduate where they
study closely the attitudes of people
towards the government it turns out on
the eve of the election so like before
the election you know before Florida in
the Supreme Court about 75% of the
population didn't think there was an
election going on at all as far as they
were concerned there had
towards the thing happening was that
it's some kind of a business with
involving rich contributors political
leaders and the public relations
industry which is training candidates to
say meaningless words that they don't
understand that they think will maybe
pick up a few more votes well that's
only 75 percent of the public so of
course they didn't care very much
you know if the supreme court happened
to hand it over to one of them rather
than the other in fact most people voted
against their own interests and
consciously because they knew it didn't
matter much they were supposed to vote
on what are called qualities not issues
like do you like the guy you want to be
with him or something like that you
wanna have a drink with him in a bar
something like that that was the issue
in the election people didn't even know
where the candidates stood on issues and
it's not because they're stupid it was
extremely hard to figure out where they
stood on issues and that they're trained
to make it hard and in fact most of the
issues that the public cared about
weren't even allowed to come up so the
major issues if you look at public added
concerns the major issues have to do
with economic affairs International
Economic Affairs what's misleadingly
called globalization and the trade
deficit and job security and things like
that but none of that stuff came up you
know you can't bring those issues up and
the elections the the free trade area of
the Americas was coming up it was going
to be a summit of the Americas in a
couple of months issues on which the
public has extremely strong opinions but
none of it could be brought up in the
election and for a very simple reason if
you take a look at attitudes there's a
very sharp split between elite opinion
which is strongly in favor of all of
this stuff and the public which is
strongly opposed to them and therefore
it can't come up
the election and didn't these issues our
unmentioned virtually nobody knew that
the free trade area of the Americas was
coming along so that what about what do
you do well you have to decide whether
you want to live in a Democratic Society
or not if you want to live in the kind
of society that saved Madison envisioned
okay that's choice but certainly not
necessary over the last couple of
hundred years there has been a very
substantial extension of the right of
the population of the ability to
participate make a difference it's not
overwhelming and there's always a
struggle to beat it back but it's no
reason why that can't continue and
that's the alternative it's not a matter
of naming one party or another but just
changing the whole framework in which
politics persists largely because of the
extremely narrow concentration of
economic power which you know removes
from the public arena most decisions
belong there there's a major effort
underway right now to reduce it even
further well you don't have to accept
this
