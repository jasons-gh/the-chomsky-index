then Ellsberg describes his remarkable
new book which is essential reading as a
chronicle of human madness and the
record that's reviewed easily lives up
to the title and raises serious
questions about whether the human
species is an evolutionary error an
objective and informed observer might
conclude that since World War two
the species has been dedicated to
establishing the thesis that humans are
simply a mistake that actually should
have occurred to everyone with eyes open
on August 6 1945 they that I remember
all too vividly of both the horrifying
news and the casual reaction to it
actually it resonated when I read
recently William Perry's comment that
he's doubly terrified both by the
extreme and mounting dangers and by the
lack of concern over the threat of
terminal destruction those awful events
of August 6th and taught us that human
intelligence in its glory had devised
means of destruction that would surely
soon escalate to the point where a mass
suicide would be imminent and that's
indeed what has ensued those familiar
with the record will be aware that it's
a near miracle that we survived this far
and such miracles cannot be expected to
persist it's all too easy to list flash
points around
world that might right now tomorrow
explode to terminal conflagration and
it's useful to remember that when the
Doomsday Clock was first set back in
1947 it was seven minutes to midnight
which seems like halcyon days today from
our perspective well in 1945 we did not
yet know that the nuclear age the onset
of the nuclear age that coincided with
the onset of a new geological epoch
so-called Anthropocene in which humans
are laboring and not only to destroy
organized human life but many other
species too because of the accompanying
sixth extension that precedes along with
the Anthropocene proceeds on its lethal
course well there have been debates
about the onset of the Anthropocene but
last year the world geological
organization settled on the ons on the
end of the beginning of the post-war era
because of the sharp escalation in
environmental destruction that has taken
place since that time and when the
Doomsday Clock was moved to two minutes
to midnight
last January the accompanying statement
opened by quote morning of the failure
to respond effectively to the looming
threats of nuclear war and climate
change making the world security
situation more dangerous than it was a
year ago
and as dangerous that has been since
world war ii which i think is an
understatement our prime concern here
was on the first of these threats the
nuclear age
but it's hard to avoid mention of the
utterly astonishing fact that the most
powerful state in human history with
unparalleled advantages is not only
refusing to join the rest of the world
in making at least some effort to deal
with the imminent and quite devastating
threat of global warming but worse yet
is devoting its energies to accelerating
the races to destruction and wall for
the exalted purpose of stuffing a few
more dollars into overstuffed pockets
before we say goodbye to the hopes for
survival and also it's hard to mention
the no less astonishing fact that so
little notices taken of this amazing
spectacle hard to find can't find the
historical precedent for it and what it
all tells us about our society and our
culture and again that's doubly
terrifying but let's keep to the nuclear
threat there will be little disagreement
here I'm sure on the compelling need to
eliminate to rid the earth of the
scourge of nuclear weapons and others
today will surely discuss the many ways
to approach this goal but I therefore
like to say a few words about a
different topic different though clearly
related one which I don't think receives
the attention that it deserves and we
might approach the topic that I have in
mind by formulating a simple question
it's worth some reflection what would
happen if political leaders decided to
obey the supreme law of the land
just our own
laws in particular to obey the United
Nations Charter treaty made by the
United States in the words of the
Constitution Article six thus part of
the supreme law of the land that supreme
law of the land obligates us to resort
to peaceful means in the event of
international disputes and to refrain
from the threat my stress threat or use
of force and international affairs
that's an obligation under the
Constitution and you might ask yourself
when that legal obligation was last
observed by the President or any other
high officials we might you know the
answer to that and we might also reflect
on what that means well
adherence to the supreme law of the land
in the past would have spared us many
tragedies as well as some very near
super tragedies one crucial case
instantly comes to mind should not be
forgotten adherence to the supreme law
of the land would have saved us from
what arthur schlesinger rightly called
the most dangerous moment in history
Schlesinger's term for the Cuban Missile
Crisis in 1962 the frightening story
should be familiar I won't review it
except to mention that Washington's
Kennedy is a terrorist war against Cuba
which of course was a serious violation
of the US Constitution it was a
significant factor in inducing
Khrushchev to undertake the reckless act
of placing missiles in Cuba as
scholarship no fully recognizes
dan dan Ellsberg who was who followed
the events closely from a privileged
position within the government at that
time he now concludes that the terrorist
war was probably the prime factor in
four shifts decision the facts about
that are not as well known as they
should be
but you should recall that Kennedy's
official plan for the terrorist war was
formulated in national national security
memorandum 181 September 1962 and I'll
quote it the plan was to engineer an
internal revolt in October that would be
followed by US military intervention
that was a month before the Missile
Crisis and in fact terror was being
escalated at that point in preparation
and was a very serious matter the record
reveals that quite clearly and more than
enough was surely known to Russia and
China Cuba and Russia well in brief
respect for the US Constitution would
very likely have averted the most
dangerous moment in history and it was
no small matter those of you familiar
with it know that we escaped by a near
miracle and it's much too little
understood well legality aside there are
perhaps some other reasons that other
questions that might be raised about a
murderous and destructive terrorist war
or so one might assume but mistakenly
there's a review of
released government documents on the
terrorists war by Harvard Latin American
scholar Jorge Dominguez and he writes
that only once in these nearly thousand
pages of documentation that a US
official raised something that resembled
a faint moral objection to US government
sponsored terrorism a member of the
National Security Council staff
suggested that the terrorist raids are
haphazard and kill innocents which might
mean a bad press in friendly countries
that's it so perhaps it's not a good
idea that's it in a thousand pages of
documentation the terrorist war is a
crime if not the prime example of that
fact that engendered the crisis and
incidentally for those of you who have
read the XCOM transcripts you'll the
detailed transcripts of the
deliberations about the crisis it is
literally not mentioned once not just
doesn't matter it's our right our right
to conduct terrorist wars which lead to
virtual destruction and there's no need
to even think about it first few people
even know about it well respect for
elementary moral values as well as
respect for law would have spared the
world very likely would have spared the
world this close brush with terminal
disaster it's not the first time it's
not the last time up till the moment and
the same guiding principles that is
simply observing law offer promising
ways to deal with the crises that led to
quote the Doomsday Clock announcement
again led to a world security situation
as dangerous that has been since World
Wide World War two that's the latest
setting the Doomsday Clock as close as
it's come to terminal disaster since
1953 when also two minutes to midnight
when the United States and later the
Soviet Union exploded thermonuclear
weapons so let's take a look at the
examples the that are mentioned the
cases that are mentioned in the current
Doomsday Clock statement well the first
one is North Korea so has there been a
diplomatic path in the case of the North
Korea situation now there is one
possibility it's been advanced by China
for some years sport of Russia
intermittent support from North Korea
that's a double freeze North Korea would
freeze its development of nuclear
weapons and missiles the United States
in response would cease its military
actions threatening military actions on
the borders that includes menacing
flights by nuclear capable bombers the
most advanced u.s. bombers and that's
not a laughing matter in a country that
was flattened by u.s. bombs
merciless us bombing in Easy memory and
in fact when there was nothing left to
destroy because all the targets were
done the US Air Force simply have
destroyed the dams resultant comments
about it in the official documents the
Air Force quarterly this was if anybody
cares a crime for which Nazi war
criminals were hanged at Nuremberg well
a double freeze it would have opened the
way to further negotiations they might
have gone as far as what has it been
what was achieved in 2005 that's worth
bearing in mind what that was because
the press has been seriously distorting
what happened in 2005 was that under
international pressure President Bush
agreed to enter into the sixth power
negotiations and there was success
substantial success I'll quote North
Korea agreed I'm now quoting the
agreement North Korea agreed to abandon
all nuclear weapons and existing weapons
programs and allow international
inspections so let me repeat that
because there are constant lies about it
every time you open the newspaper North
Korea agreed to abandon all nuclear
weapons and existing weapons programs
and allow international inspections the
in return the United States was to
provide a light water reactor for
medical use issue a non-aggression
pledge and join an agreement that the
two sides on quoting would respect each
other's sovereignty exist peacefully
together and take steps to normalize
relations that was 2005 so what happened
instantly within days the Bush
administration toured the agreement to
shreds it renewed the threat of
it froze North Korean funds and foreign
banks and it disbanded the consortium
that was to provide North Korea with a
light water reactor
Bruce Cummings the leading career
scholar as you know writes that the
sanctions were specifically designed to
destroy the September pledges and to
head off the accommodation between
Washington and Pyongyang
that's 2005 the I won't review the press
common press coverage of this but open
the newspaper and you'll see it says
exactly the opposite now the path could
have been pursued for several years and
now as we know there is better options
so a couple of weeks ago on April 27th
North and South Korea launched signed a
historic document from the German
declaration for peace prosperity
unification of the Korean Peninsula and
the words of the document are worth
reading closely and carefully in the
declaration I'm quoting it now the two
Koreas affirmed the principle of
determining the destiny of the Korean
nation on their own accord on their own
accord there's a very important words
they went on to call for to completely
cease all hostile acts against each
other in every domain to actively
cooperate to establish a permanent and
solid peace regime on the Korean
Peninsula to carry out disarmament in a
phased manner in order to achieve the
common goal of realizing through
complete denuclearization a nuclear-free
Korean Peninsula to strengthen the
positive moment
towards continuous advancement of
inter-korean relations as well as the
peace prosperity and unification of the
Korean Peninsula and they further agreed
to actively seek the support and
cooperation of the international
community which means the United States
for the denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula and furthermore as Korea's
specialist in moon refused in a current
issue of Foreign Affairs general foreign
affairs of the two Koreas did not just
make high-level commitments on quoting
him they also laid out specific
timetables for implementing them and
took concrete steps that will have
immediate effects in facilitating
cooperation and preventing conflict
which is as he points out something new
and significant there have been
agreements before but never with this
specificity and again it's important to
read the words of the Declaration
carefully their import is very clear the
United States should back off and allow
the two Koreas to achieve peace
disarmament unification and complete
denuclearization we should accept the
call for support and cooperation of this
with this endeavor on the part of the
Korean nation it's two parts to
determine their destiny on their own
accord virtual words of the Declaration
so to put it more simply the declaration
as a white letter or saying dear mr.
Trump declare victory if you want to
prance around and public but please just
go away
let us move towards peace
denuclearization and disarmament and the
plea would hardly be more clear it's
very far from the interpretation here
and that's worth paying attention to as
well so the general reaction here was
lucidly articulated by mark Lander
foreign policy specialists in The New
York Times he explained that the
declaration complicates Washington's
strategy quoting him mr. Trump will find
it hard threatened military action
against the country that's extending an
olive branch it's true it's pretty hard
to threaten military action which
incidentally is a criminal act
remember the threat of force is a
criminal act and it's hard to do that
when the target is extending an olive
branch so we really have some problems
it's clearly that it's very clear that
peaceful means are available to mitigate
one of the most serious of the threats
that's bringing the world as close to
terminal disaster as it's been since
World War two since the onset of the
nuclear age and citizen efforts can be
significant that maybe even decisive in
realizing the prospects for peace in
Northeast Asia that now are indeed
before us and realizing the efforts to
ensure that Washington does not once
again undermine the prospects for peace
in Northeast Asia and I stress once
again since it is not the first time
it's also worth noting that US analysts
then very clear and quite frank about
the real nature of the North Korean
threat
so here's foreign affairs commentator
max Fisher in The New York Times he
writes that North Korea has achieved
what no country has since China
developed its own program a half century
ago a nuclear deterrent against the
United States they've achieved that and
Trump's threats and sanctions he says
have not succeeded to reverse or stall
these gains so clearly we must do
something to prevent anyone from
deterring our resort to force and
violence that's a fundamental principle
of u.s. foreign policy well let's turn
to Iran which poses a similar problem
similar to North Korea among specialists
across the spectrum political spectrum
they find very few who would disagree
with the conclusion of the respected and
properly conservative International
Institute of Strategic Studies this is
2010 when there was still some thought
that maybe Iran is developing nuclear
weapons
they concluded that Iran's nuclear
program and the willingness to keep open
the possibility of developing nuclear
weapons is a central part of its
deterrent strategy US intelligence
concurs they were reporting to Congress
regularly that the Iranian threat is
part of their deterrent strategy and
again it's intolerable to the two rogue
states that rampage in the region that
anyone should
a deterrent well there's much talk about
Iran's possible violations of the jcpoa
the joint program the Iran deal even
though the International Atomic Energy
Agency insurance of US intelligence has
repeatedly given around a clean bill of
health
there however is virtually no talk about
the fact that the US has been violating
the agreement from the very beginning
and it's continuing to do so so the u.s.
if you read the agreement that says the
u.s. the US has in fact been repeatedly
seeking to block Iran's reintegration
into the global economy particularly the
global financial systems control right
here in New York and to undermine I'm
quoting the agreement to undermine the
normalization of trade and economic
relations with Iran all of that is in
violation of the agreement strict
violation it's ignored on the prevailing
tacit assumption that the indispensable
nation stands above the law will Trump's
decision a couple days ago to
effectively withdraw from the agreement
was not surprising it was of course
anticipated and contrary to what so
often said Trump is actually highly
predictable he's constantly described as
unpredictable but that's simply untrue
in fact that you can predict with close
precision exactly what he's going to do
simply by recognizing the guiding
principle which is quite simple the
guiding principle is me me me
exclamation mark and there's a corollary
namely if anything was
by the Black Diamond maybe Antichrist
who preceded then you do the opposite
just think through the policy decisions
of the last couple of years and predicts
it with virtual precision so the and it
just doesn't matter what the
consequences are that's kind of
irrelevant they're just like on
destroying the climate it's somebody
else's business and in this case the
consequences it might be we don't know
to induce Iranian hardliners to return
to nuclear programs which they had
abandoned that could provide an opening
for John Bolton Netanyahu the rest of
them to realize their openly stated
goals of direct aggression with
consequences that range from awful to
horrendous well are their peaceful
options and in this case the question
simply doesn't even arise the US could
rejoin the world could permit the jcpoa
to function effectively as it's been
doing and perhaps the u.s. might even
refrain from regular and constant
violations of the agreement all of
that's possibility but actually we can
do a lot better than that now this one
point on which I agree with President
Trump he's constantly talking about ways
to improve the agreement and there are
ways very interesting ways and the most
obvious and constructive ones for some
odd reason or never mentioned so let me
mention them the agreement could be
extended to a step to moving towards
establishing a nuclear weapons free zone
in the Middle East the spread of such
zones around the world as
in itself for mitigating threats but it
also has symbolic significance of no
slight importance in simply as an
expression of the global determination
to rid the world of these monstrous
devices and in the troubled Middle East
region it would be of particular
importance just come back to that in a
moment but as an aside and we might bear
in mind that in other regions such
positive steps to reduce the threat of
nuclear weapons have been attempted but
they've been impeded and by the refusal
of one country to permit the zones to go
into effect so there's an Africa and
nuclear weapons free zone but it can't
go into effect held back by Washington's
development of nuclear facilities in
Diego Garcia which is regularly used for
bombing Central Asia it's particularly
true under Obama who rapidly extended it
to include nuclear submarines nuclear
pre positioning the asia-pacific nuclear
free war zone nuclear weapons-free zone
that can't go into effect because of US
insistence of US military bases there
accommodate nuclear weapons so that's
more work for us to do make it public do
something about it
well coming back to the Middle East
serious steps towards a nuclear weapons
free zone would undercut any imaginable
threat that Iran is alleged to pose and
there's no need to obtain Iran's
acquiescence they have been vociferous
Lee calling for it for years
particularly as the spokesperson for the
g77 former non-aligned countries
which are strongly calling for this for
years and what about the Arab states
absolutely no problem they're the ones
who initiated the proposal started with
Egypt about 20 years ago so they're
strongly in favor as overwhelming
international support so why doesn't it
happen
well actually the matter does come up
every five years in the NPT review
sessions and there's one problem the
United States feet doesn't that's why it
doesn't happen last one was Obama in
nineteen twenty fifteen and the reason
is perfectly obvious everyone
don't even have to bother stating and
Israel's nuclear weapons systems must
not be subject even to inspection let
alone steps towards dismantling there's
various reasons given for this but there
below even discussion that not even
worth mentioning we understand the
reasons and so I understand we cannot
improve the jcpoa in the obvious manner
it's important to add to this that the
United States along with the United
Kingdom have a special responsibility to
work to establish a Middle East nuclear
weapons free zone they're committed to
this goal these two countries
specifically are committed to this goal
by a important Security Council
resolution 687 article 14 if you want to
look it up it commits the those who
initiated and voted for the resolution
US and Britain to a stop move to
establish a nuclear weapons free zone
and that commitment takes on even
greater force because it's this
resolution to which the US and Britain
appeal when they were seeking
desperately to find some
the legal pretext for invading Iraq well
it's another example that illustrates
the value of observing the supreme law
of the land and even of referring to it
you might find and see if you can find
anyone even discussing these facts well
I won't go on but case by case if you
run through the record you'll find that
serious investigation it does reveal the
wisdom of the principles of the Charter
and actually the principles of the
founders who created the constitutional
obligation to abide by valid treaties
well it could be argued and indeed often
is argued that law including
international law is a living instrument
and it's substance changes depending on
prevailing practice which would of
course include the practices of the
global hegemonic power and we need not
tarry on the conclusions that would
follow from this line of reasoning but
concerned citizens should not tolerate
these conclusions and it's unnecessary
to stress that a great deal is at stake
in reversing them reaching as far as
safeguarding the future of humanity
thank you
[Music]
it strikes me in terms of professor
Chomsky's original field of linguistics
and his groundbreaking work that human
beings have an innate capacity for
language that we also have an innate
capacity for love and for seeking truth
and I think that in his other field of
political and social criticism that
professor Chomsky bears that out as well
we do have a microphone great I was
going to ask if we did all right a few
questions and I would love love love to
have gender balance and with your
permission I'm going to try to make that
happen
I wonder if you could comment on a
thought that I've had over the past week
and maybe a lot of people had that North
and South Korea are creating this
unprecedented armistice with the backing
of China and Russia and I wondered
whether that is looking towards a new
axis of power of world power in which
the United States would be less relevant
than and I'm being ironic
here then it thinks it would a corollary
question to that is do you believe that
people like the people in this room and
people across the country are going to
be able to fault a Bolton and pay OLED
march and frog marching maybe Frog March
is the wrong word because he's so eager
for it Trump to use the use of nuclear
weapons first part was the possibility
of a new axis confluence of interest
let's say between North and South Korea
China and Russia it's a counter u.s.
power especially u.s. threats to Korea
and the second one is in terms of do we
have the power as citizenry to stop
Pompeo Bolton at all from catastrophe
the second I think yes of course I mean
there's plenty of things we can do to
reverse policy with all
the flaws of this country it's still a
remarkably free country by comparative
standards we have plenty of
opportunities about what might
eventually you know you got to speculate
but I think something that's not
unlikely if Trump's advisors have at
least half a brain still functioning
they have a very simple policy that they
can follow tell him to shut up just stay
away
as I said prance around in public talk
about what a great deal maker you are I
you've overcome what Obama failed to do
you made the great deal of the century
but just stay away let them work it out
take credit for it and then I think
what's likely to eventuate is not a
career china-russia agreement but rather
a development in Korea rather like
Vietnam in fact I'll just tell you an
anecdote I went to North Vietnam in 1970
right in the middle of the bombing there
happened to be a brief bombing pause and
I was invited to come didn't tell me the
reason but it turned out the reason was
they wanted me to lecture at the
Polytechnic University or rather the
ruins of the university during the brief
bombing Clause Oh a couple of days I
talked about everything I could think
about they run a very tight State so you
do what they tell you to do the first
morning that I was there with Doug Dowd
and dick Fernandez who some of you know
the first morning we were taken to a war
museum where we sat for three hours
listening to an incredibly boring
discussion about the wars that Vietnam
had with China and the 12th century and
so on and so forth and what they were
telling us
is very simple and anybody with a brain
could have understood it the US
intelligence apparently didn't have a
clue
they were telling us look you guys are
bombing us but you're going to go away
that guy up there is going to stay there
he's our problem China is our problem
not you you'll go away we'll still have
China looming the war could I mean this
was so obvious it took a I mean the
inability to comprehend that is
mind-boggling but strength of ideology
is such it couldn't be comprehended and
I think it's probably the same with
Korea we're going to go away but China
is still going to be there and it's not
unlikely that if again if the Trump
people have any brains at all minimal
understanding of the world they could
pull out pull off something which would
be good for the world for once and might
end up with Korea being kind of like
Vietnam you know moving toward you have
to remember the power of the United
States it's overwhelming
there's a lot of talk about u.s. decline
and if you look at figures like what's
usually discussed you know GDP per and
so on so forth yes looks like a decline
but if you look at the actual figures
it's not at the climb you take a look at
the proportion of the US economy global
economy that's owned by us-based
multinationals that's the real measure
it's about 50 percent
it's just nothing remotely comparable to
this in human history 50 percent of the
global economy is owned by us-based
multinationals their first or second in
every category the u.s. runs the
International
financial system could be changed but
nobody's likely to change it in military
terms the u.s. is so far ahead of anyone
else you can't even talk about it nobody
is going to fiddle and the u.s. is a
very dangerous country the violent
brutal country nobody wants to take any
chances with it
so I suspect that again if the Trump
people are thinking they could reach a
outcome which I'd be happy to applaud
even knowing that it's totally cynical
and vicious and so on and that's a very
possible outcome I think well if I can
just follow up do you see the
possibility that at least in the short
term China might play a positive role in
reaching an agreement as a guarantor of
North Korea's security at least in a
short will I think China has been
playing that role they've been playing a
pretty sensible role in this case and
there are other things that are doing
which I think are totally unacceptable
but in this particular case China has
been for years calling for a diplomatic
settlement and even proposing an obvious
way to do it perfectly obvious way you
start with a double freeze move on to
negotiations maybe you could get back to
2005 which was a very good agreement not
the only one but a very good one that
couldn't have played a more constructive
role so yes I suppose they'll continue
to do it they don't want us troops on
their border and they don't want us
troops and stuff before collapsing or
the certainly not the collapse of the
regime and it instantly everyone
understands including US intelligence
that the North Korean regime which may
be the most disgusting regime in history
but whatever you think about it they are
trying to get to economic development
that's agreed on all sides and they
cannot do it as long as there's the
crushing burden of an arms race actually
if you look at history this is very
similar
to what was happening in Russia in the
late 1950s when Khrushchev came in he
understood that Russia was way behind
the United States and every imaginable
respect military economic and anything
else and he wanted to reduce the
military burden so that Russia could
develop economically and he actually
offered the United States a sharp mutual
reduction in offensive weapons
when Kennedy considered it rejected it
and responded by the biggest increase in
armaments in human history that's one of
the factors that led for chef's to put
the missiles in Cuba to right try to
write the military balance the other was
the terrorists war and we should think
about those things in each one of these
cases there were things that could have
been done that would have averted in
this case almost terminal war and it
remains true today the similarity in
Korea Russia different many ways but
this similarity is a real one and worth
thinking about these things come up all
the time
it's also worth remembering that if you
look at the record of US intelligence
estimates in very almost invariably
they've wildly overestimated enemy
adversary capacities it was true of
Grand forces in Europe the bomber gap
the missile gap the Iranian threat case
after case wild threat inflation
probably believed that one of the
interesting things about Dan's book an
old works book from when he was on the
inside that round is basically part of
the Air Force is that he says they did
believe fervently all of the totally
false estimates and it's quite
interesting how the intelligence worked
that tells you something - turns out
that army until
was accurately estimating the Russian
non-existent missile threat Air Force
intelligence was wildly overestimating
it round was part of the Air Force so
they did - what does that have to do
with budgets has to do with us budgets
the Air Force wants the big budget the
army didn't want the budget for the Air
Force those are the considerations on
which the fate of the world rests as
long as we allow everyone please thank
professor Chomsky again
